Many bitcoin devotees wanted little to do with government legislators or regulators and regulators were dubious of this new currency.    Since 2014, however, we\'ve seen a serious and significant shift among government officials and within the bitcoin/blockchain community. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have approved certain bitcoin/blockchain-related activities under their jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service has opined that digital currencies such as bitcoin are taxed as "property." The Chamber of Digital Commerce opened its doors in Washington, DC, about two years ago and has made huge strides in helping public policy makers understand the potential promise of blockchain technology. While these are all affirmative steps for the disruptive industry and for consumers/investors, more needs to be done.     When the internet was being developed, an effort and initiative by the Clinton administration to ensure that the fledgling idea would not be overly regulated was put in place \u2014 the 1997 Framework for Global Electronic Commerce. The point: to ensure laws and regulation would not negatively impact innovation. Current CFTC Commissioner Chris Giancarlo recently (and rightly) called for such protection for digital currency. President Obama  should heed the call.      To make matters more complicated, many regulations in the U.S. are actually state-level guidelines as they relate to what are termed "money transmitters." Without some proactive step(s), such as a self-regulatory organization (SRO) and/or word from on high by the president, the U.S. could lose out on what are potentially enormous economic benefits.     With an  available supply of more than 15.5 million bitcoins, the digital currency now has a market capitalization of nearly US$7 billion, according an estimate by market-data site CoinCap. That\'s to say nothing of the colossal commercial value of blockchain endeavors which could help fuel-inject the economic engine of our democracy.   The blockchain itself holds untold promise and potential for revolutionizing everything from banking and trading exchanges to real estate \u2014 even electronic voting.    The European Union has developed a business-friendly regulatory regime for e-money and authorized payment institutions, which can operate across EU member states under the so-called "passport" system. This approach stands in clear contrast with our fragmented state-by-state regulation of equivalent U.S. institutions.    There is a huge opportunity that can be tapped into if U.S. government officials and industry thought-leaders establish an appropriate balance between basic consumer protection regulation and an openness which not only permits, but fosters and promotes, innovation.  We did it with the internet \u2014 and we need to do it now with virtual currencies like bitcoin.   Commentary by Bart Chilton, former commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Now, some education facilities are turning to bitcoin technology for help.  They are using blockchain, which was developed alongside the digital cryptocurrency bitcoin, to record their students\' achievements in a cheap, secure and public way. Blockchain works like a decentralized ledger, storing information on a global network that is publicly available and should be safe from tampering. One example is Holberton School of software engineering in San Francisco, which was established as a project-based alternative to college. In October 2015, the school announced plans to share academic certificates on blockchain from 2017. "For employers, it avoids having them to spend valuable time checking candidates\' educational credentials by having to call universities or to pay a third party to do the job," Sylvain Kalache, co-founder at Holberton School, told CNBC via email.   Using blockchain also means the school saves money from building and operating its own database.    "Because of the design of the blockchain-distributed database, it cannot go down and cannot be altered, making the data always available and secure \u2026 the blockchain does this free of charge," Kalache said.    The University of Nicosia in Cyprus is also using the technology to record students\' achievements and it is proving popular, according to George Papageorgiou, a digital currency lecturer at the university.     "We\'ve only encountered enthusiasm in the practical uses so far and students are glad to be able to verify, with their new knowledge and the blockchain, that their digital certificate is genuine and that it cannot be recreated," he told CNBC via email.     "We believe this instills confidence in both students and potential employers that (they) can check on their own, whether a presented certificate is real or not," he added.   Ed Featherston, director at digital consultancy Collaborative Consulting, said he was working with several universities considering adopting blockchain technology.    Apart from using it to cheaply track and record students\' coursework, some were considering providing micro-courses and micro-credentials, verified through the blockchain.     "We eliminate all of the overhead of the intermediary third-party systems to try and validate all of this [coursework]," he said. "The cost of it from a systemic and transactional perspective becomes much lower and makes it a much more feasible concept to do."    Featherston also said that having a student\'s transcript recorded on the blockchain meant they could more easily control who saw it and would be useful for those who wanted to change colleges.    In February, Sony Global Education announced plans for a blockchain service that would allow students to securely transmit data. For instance, they could safely share their exam results with a potential employer.    "The technology has the potential to realize an entirely new infrastructure system for sharing records securely over the network in any number of ways, opening new doors of possibility for academic records and how they are assessed," Sony Global Education said in a press release.

A research paper commissioned by the research arm of the global financial messaging service SWIFT - the SWIFT Institute - was published Monday based on interviews and focus group meetings with individuals from 75 organizations working in technology and post-trade processing.    The conclusion was that while blockchain \u2013 a distributed ledger technology \u2013 will be important, there is currently too much hype.    "Strong claims are now being made about the potential of mutual distributed ledgers to reduce costs and risks. A number of initiatives applying mutual distributed ledger to securities settlement are now being pursued, attracting substantial investment from both major banks and venture capital funds," authors Alistair Milne from the U.K.\'s Loughborough University and Michael Mainelli from Z/Yen Group wrote.     "Understanding of the technology however lags well behind the hype, amongst practitioners, policy makers and industry commentators alike. \'Blockchain\' technology seems to promise major change for capital markets and other financial services \u2013 some say it may ultimately prove to be as important an innovation as the internet itself \u2013 but few can say exactly how or why."    Banks in particular have been experimenting with ways to use blockchain tech to do tasks from clearing trades to creating contracts.    A firm called R3 has brought together a group of the world\'s biggest banks including JPMorgan and Citigroup and is dedicated to researching and delivering new financial technology. Meanwhile, Digital Asset Holdings \u2013 a firm run by former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters \u2013 is developing blockchain technology that can be used by the banks. Earlier this year, the company partnered with JPMorgan to explore the technology.  Speaking to CNBC earlier this year, Masters said that various forms of blockchain technology will be "deployed in a commercial setting in less than a couple of years", highlighting the optimism in the industry about its uptake.     And the authors of the SWIFT Institute\'s paper clearly see a benefit too, suggesting blockchain technology provides the industry "with an opportunity to harmonize business processes and address many long-neglected inefficiencies in post-trade and other financial operations".     Still, the paper dispelled a long-held myth about blockchain \u2013 that it would get rid of third parties in trades. The idea is that two or more parties would be able to use blockchain technology to carry out a trade and this could all be done without the need for any other interference. But the SWIFT Institute said that a central third party role would still exist, albeit more narrowly, as a mean of confirming identity and existence of an asset, as well as dispute resolution and enforcing legal obligations.     And financial institutions will need to overcome some challenges to welcome blockchain technology. One of those is opening up and sharing data in order for these databases to work, according to the authors. For example, if four or five banks want to be involved in a trading transaction via a blockchain, they will need to be willing to share certain data that they may not have done in the past.     Using blockchain technology would also mean a "reengineering of business processes across multiple firms", something that could be time-consuming and costly but ultimately beneficial in the long-term.     Essentially, the adoption of blockchain in financial trading, will require an industry-wide effort.    "While blockchain offers the potential to transform the industry, fully achieving these benefits will require board level buy-in to a substantial commitment of time and resource, and active regulatory support for reform of business processes, with relatively little short term payoff," the report said.

It is "overwhelmingly likely" that the financial industry will adopt uses for the technology underpinning bitcoin, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers  said.    "I\'m reasonably confident ... that the blockchain will change a great deal of financial practice and exchange," he said Tuesday from the Consensus 2016 event in midtown Manhattan, adding that his bet on the future of finance would see "40 years from now, blockchain and all that followed from it will figure more prominently in that story than will bitcoin."    Summers referred to blockchain technology\'s ability to reduce inefficient frictions during asset transfers, but he sounded a much-less confident note about the cryptocurrency for which it was originally invented.    Still, Summers said he disagreed with 2015 comments from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon that virtual currency is "going to be stopped," and "no government will ever support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesn\'t have the same controls."    "Jamie\'s a smart guy," Summers said. "But Bill Gates is a smart guy too and he said the internet\'s not going anyplace."    As for the cryptocurrency\'s future, Summers said several times that the government "will still enforce laws," but that certainty of bitcoin\'s demise is "not the right position to take."    But Summers also attempted to dash any hopes that bitcoin \u2014 which has been embraced by some pro-anarchism communities \u2014 could create anything like "a libertarian paradise." In fact, he said that existing laws about cross-border money transfers will "for sure, for sure, for sure" be changed to cover virtual currency.  Many firms are aiming to make Summers\' prediction a reality, including Ripple, which hopes to use a variant of the technology to connect the global settlement network through the blockchain, and Circle, which is aiming to facilitate global peer-to-peer payments in part through bitcoin\'s network. Blockchain technology has been the subject of increasingly ecstatic media and investor excitement as a fix for everything from medical records to global identification, but many at the blockchain-focused Consensus conference told CNBC there was an air of overhype. "We don\'t think the blockchain can do most of what\'s been ascribed to it," Ripple CEO Chris Larsen said. "But we\'re entering the internet of value \u2014 and that is very much underhyped."   And while some investors and techies spent the blockchain-focused conference pitching how a secure, unchangeable global ledger (a blockchain) could supplant the existing global monetary system, others suggested it could take a more ironic role.    That is, the technology behind bitcoin could change money forever \u2014 by helping fiat currency be more efficient. Instead of a trustless network of economically incentivized database maintainers (called "miners" in the bitcoin community), a variant of blockchain technology would be employed by the very central banks that crypto-anarchists speak against, several projected.    For one, Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert predicted that the U.S. Federal Reserve and the People\'s Bank of China will seek to digitize their current fiat currencies, issuing something akin to RMB-coin, or dollar-coin. That is, central banks will issue digitized tokens that represent their current currencies \u2014 but those systems\' security will be underpinned by bitcoin technology.    There are a wide range of benefits for central banks ranging from tracking money\'s velocity and its usage to easier issuance of stimulus "helicopter" money, sources said.   "There\'s going to be an important distinction between central banks\' coins and bitcoin," Silbert said Monday. "They\'re certainly not going to cap the output."    Bitcoin derives its value in part because of scarcity: It\'s hard-wired into the code that there will only ever be a certain amount of the token. Central banks, on the other hand, will want to be able to create more digital assets as monetary policy requires.   Silbert added that central banks\' digital currencies, which he characterized as a likely outcome (if not virtual certainty), are "only going to enhance the government\'s ability to see what you\'re doing."    Reports from earlier this year have already indicated that China\'s central bank is considering using the technology.    "The PBC has studied digital currency for a long time. History shows that currency has evolved abreast with technological advances and development of economic activities," People\'s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in February, according to the transcript of an interview with Caixin Weekly.    "With the rapid development of the internet and the significant changes in the global payment systems, it is necessary to establish the issuance and circulation system of digital currency, which will help build the financial infrastructure and improve the quality and efficiency of the economy," he added.    Within the U.S., St. Louis Fed Vice President David Andolfatto wrote earlier this week that "there is no reason why, in principle, central banks could not offer online digital money accounts for the public."    Citing advantages like eliminating deposit insurance and reducing the cost of maintaining paper currency, Andolfatto proposes a basic utility account, which would also make it easy to enforce interest rates (including negative ones). He\'s even gone further down the rabbit hole, discussing the idea of a "Fedcoin" in an earlier post.

At the Consensus 2016 event in midtown Manhattan on Monday, surrounded by longtime bitcoin believers, speculative investors and many in between, early bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen stood on stage and declared that he was confident he knew who had created the powerful technology.     That is, Andresen \u2014 the chief scientist for the Bitcoin Foundation and a longtime member of the cryptocurrency\'s primary development community \u2014 said he was not troubled by the outcry of criticism that had erupted since multiple media outlets reported an Australian entrepreneur\'s claims that he was the notoriously secretive Satoshi Nakamoto.     "I still believe that Craig Wright is, beyond a reasonable doubt, Satoshi Nakamoto," Andresen said Monday during a panel at the conference \u2014 an event focused on bitcoin and distributed ledger technology \u2014 adding that his recent blog post to that effect was not the result of a hacking as some had claimed.    And Andresen\'s opinion is hard to discount: He was the core developer of bitcoin\'s code for many of its early years. In fact, he\'s been deemed "the man who really built bitcoin," for his work after Nakamoto apparently put him in charge.    But at that Monday panel, only a few hours after Andresen had told the world he was confident Wright was the technology\'s true creator, others were pushing back.    "I think he\'s not Satoshi," Vitalik Buterin, the founder of bitcoin competitor (or compliment, depending on who you ask) Ethereum, said as Andresen wrapped up \u2014 echoing a sentiment expressed by many others at the event.      A rail-thin 20-something in a t-shirt among Monday\'s Wall Street-heavy crowd, Buterin pitched the Nakamoto question as a simple matter of game theory: The true bitcoin creator could have chosen a clear and obvious way to show his identity, or he could have conducted a convoluted and trust-requiring proof.    "Instead he\'s taken this path where he wrote this big long blog post with 200 lines that are so confusing ... and tries to only show that signature to a few select people and we\'re supposed to trust them," Buterin said. "In general, signalling theory says that if you have a good way of proving something and a noisy way of proving something, and you choose the noisy way, that means chances are it\'s because you couldn\'t do the good way in the first place."    That good way, Buterin and others said Monday, would have involved Wright publicly proving his creator status by exhibiting his cryptographic possession of the original bitcoin data, or moving uniquely addressed bitcoins that are widely known to belong to their creator.    Speaking with CNBC, Andresen admitted that Buterin\'s critique was valid.    "It\'s an excellent point, and I don\'t have an answer to that," he said, adding that he is nevertheless "absolutely confident" that Wright is the man behind the Nakamoto name.    In fact, Andresen said, the proof he saw was more persuasive than any cryptographic feat with bitcoin\'s first data \u2014 its so-called "genesis block" \u2014 could have been. (A significant portion of the digital community appears to disagree, however, as prominent developers took to Twitter and Reddit to call for that very sort of proof.)

Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright says he\'s the inventor of the digital currency bitcoin.  Wright told the BBC that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the shadowy creator of the cryptocurrency, in a move that could end the years-long search for the inventor. In a follow-up blog post on Monday, Wright thanked everyone who helped out in bitcoin\'s beginnings.    "I have been staring at my screen for hours, but I cannot summon the words to express the depth of my gratitude to those that have supported the bitcoin project from its inception \u2014 too many names to list. You have dedicated vast swathes of your time, committed your gifts, sacrificed relationships and REM sleep for years to an open source project that could have come to nothing. And yet still you fought. This incredible community\'s passion and intellect and perseverance has taken my small contribution and nurtured it, enhanced it, breathed life into it. You have given the world a great gift. Thank you," Wright wrote.    "Be assured, just as you have worked, I have not been idle during these many years. Since those early days, after distancing myself from the public persona that was Satoshi, I have poured every measure of myself into research. I have been silent, but I have not been absent. I have been engaged with an exceptional group and look forward to sharing our remarkable work when they are ready."    To prove his claim, Wright digitally signed a message using the cryptographic keys that were associated with the creator and was backed up by experts.    "These are the blocks used to send 10 bitcoins to Hal Finney in January [2009] as the first bitcoin transaction," Wright told the BBC.   Wright said Finney helped turn his vision of bitcoin into reality.     Jon Matonis, co-founder of the nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation, said he believed Wright\'s claims after seeing the same demonstration.    "During the London proof sessions, I had the opportunity to review the relevant data along three distinct lines: cryptographic, social and technical. Based on what I witnessed, it is my firm belief that Craig Steven Wright satisfies all three categories," Matonis wrote in a blog post on Monday.    "The social evidence, including his unique personality, early emails that I received, and early drafts of the Bitcoin white paper, points to Craig as the creator. I also received satisfactory explanations to my questions about registering the bitcoin.org domain and the various time-of-day postings to the BitcoinTalk forum. Additionally, Craig\'s technical working knowledge of public key cryptography, Bitcoin\'s addressing system, and proof-of-work consensus in a distributed peer-to-peer environment is very strong."    For years, news organizations have been investigating who the real founder of bitcoin is, with several names being mentioned. Someone or a group of people called "Satoshi Nakamoto" was always associated with the invention of the cryptocurrency, but nobody knew who was behind the name.   In 2014, Newsweek said that the bitcoin creator was a 64-year-old Japanese-American living in California named Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto.     Bitcoin has gained a notorious reputation as a currency that allows people to anonymously buy illegal items online. But it\'s also accepted as a form of payment by many companies, including Microsoft. Many financial institutions have begun looking at ways to use blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin.

In June, the European Commission (the legislative arm of the European Union) is set to update its anti-money laundering rules to force virtual currency exchange platforms to check their clients are who they claim.    Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are characterized by their anonymity, with neither payers nor payees required to identify themselves and the system open for anybody to use. Regulators believe this makes them attractive to criminals.    "The Commission proposes to bring virtual currency exchange platforms under the scope of the anti-money laundering directive, so that these platforms have to apply customer due-diligence controls when exchanging virtual for real currencies, ending the anonymity associated with such exchanges," the European Commission said in a news release in February.     Identification could take the form of a passport, official photographic ID or proof of residence such as a utility bill.    This follows reports the so-called Islamic State \u2014 which claimed responsibility for the attacks on March in Brussels and November in Paris \u2014 was  receiving funding via the so-called Dark Web. This is the encrypted, hard-to-reach part of the internet where bitcoin or other digital-only currencies are the preferred payment methods.    "There is a shadow banking system that now exists around the world that is capable of moving unlimited amounts of money\u2026 They (terrorists or criminals) know the banking system is well-monitored," Scott Dueweke, the founder of Zebryx, a digital identity consultancy, told CNBC via phone.     In October, a report from the U.K. Treasury and Home Office concluded digital-only currencies were already the preferred method of online payment for illicit goods like firearms and drugs. The report added that the money-laundering risk associated with digital-only currencies was low, but could rise if their use became more prevalent.     A few months later, in January, Dutch authorities arrested 10 people accused of running a bitcoin-laundering ring.  For many leading bitcoin exchanges, the change will have negligible impact, as they already comply with best practice on anti-money laundering and "know your customer" rules, Garrick Hileman, an academic at the University of Cambridge in England\'s Judge Business School, told CNBC via phone.    Those exchanges already in compliance include San Francisco-based Kraken, which claims to be the largest euro-bitcoin exchange, and Circle, a peer-to-peer digital currency player that has secured Barclays as a U.K. banking partner, Hileman said.     Other players in the space will need to come up to standard or consider relocating their operations away from the European Union or not serving EU customers. Some jurisdictions such as the U.S. and the U.K. have already launched similar crackdowns to that planned by the EU, which hopes to persuade others to do the same.     The EU also plans to toughen up on the identification requirements for using prepaid instruments, of which consumer prepaid cards make up the vast majority. These are not linked to a bank account, are topped up with cash and can include cards linked to a particular store.     It is believed prepaid cards were another means used by terrorists to anonymously finance purchases for last year\'s Paris attacks.     Under the current rules, no identification is needed for non-reloadable cards worth up to 250 euros ($283), or 500 euros for those than can only be used in one country.     These thresholds are likely to be lowered under the news rules and cardholders may need to identify themselves with an ID card or passport.    Dueweke, who has advised the U.S. government and international law enforcement agencies, said the EU\'s crackdown would only have a "superficial" impact.  Criminals and terrorists would find ways to work around the rules, he explained.      "I think that it is a knee-jerk reaction to those attacks (in Paris and Brussels)," he told CNBC.    "The lead over the legal and regulatory system by criminals using these systems is growing rather than shortening \u2026 They have been early adopters of these payments systems from the very beginning," Dueweke later added.

IBM announced Friday it is launching its framework for using the technology behind bitcoin, saying it\'s time for companies to come to terms with how the revolutionary technology will change their businesses. As firms grapple with the buzz around blockchains \u2014 a highly secure and auditable form of information storage originally conceived for digital currencies \u2014 IBM is pushing out its certified and tested version to make that process easier for financial services, government and health care.   Although it sounds technical, that\'s big news for many industries that see the technology as potentially disruptive. And it\'s big news for other companies that are rushing to make "blockchain for business" a reality. (Microsoft has said it is working with banks on a similar goal.)    Jerry Cuomo, vice president of Blockchain Technologies at IBM, described client interest in the project as "immense," adding that he doesn\'t know of a financial services company that hasn\'t expressed interest in IBM\'s platform.   \n\nRead more about the promise of blockchains here.\n\n    That platform is a curated version of the Linux Foundation\'s open source Hyperledger Project, he said. IBM was a founding member of that project along with JPMorgan, Intel, Cisco, Wells Fargo, State Street and the London Stock Exchange Group.    So Friday\'s announcement is that IBM has chosen "the good builds," run a battery of tests, certified that the framework is secure, and is now widely distributing its version of the code to developers.    The company also announced Friday that it was graduating its own cloud-based blockchain services from experimental to beta. In other words, IBM is offering to securely run a company\'s blockchain network within its own ecosystem so developers can focus on creating applications for the tech.    All of this, according to Cuomo, is to help guide a company to begin "reimagining core business processes on blockchain" \u2014 while using IBM\'s services.    The crux of the business proposition for blockchains is that the tech can offer a digital ledger that\'s stored concurrently in multiple locations and whose entries are practically unalterable once added. That\'s a powerfully appealing technology for anyone seeking to digitally handle contracts, records of ownership or other important data.   As CNBC first reported in 2014 before any significant corporate announcements about the technology, major financial and tech firms had begun looking into how they could use blockchains. And by 2016, initiatives had been announced for everything from stock trading to medical data transfers to "smart" appliances.    But blockchains are not perfect systems for all business-use cases. They are often less efficient than other database technologies and are therefore most helpful for companies seeking to create a trusted network between multiple parties: By storing unalterable copies of the same data with different parties, the integrity of the information cannot easily be called into question.    That\'s important for anyone looking to avoid involving middlemen (and their associated time and cost inefficiencies), and it\'s also an appealing prospect for any firm looking to make data storage easily auditable.    "It\'s a magic database that I haven\'t seen in my 28 years," Cuomo said of blockchains\' information-consensus qualities.    But many in the bitcoin community say the magic is dependent on the cryptocurrency for which the system was originally created. In effect, the argument goes, any "private" blockchain would be less secure without the strength of a global network of reward-motivated "miners" working to record transactions.    Cuomo, however, countered that regulatory compliance requires companies to know everyone handling their data \u2014 so a semi-anonymous network is out. IBM\'s solution, therefore, is to offer "permissioned" blockchains that control who has access to the ledger, and what roles they can play.    Despite the limitations, the appeal of employing corporate blockchains is undeniable, and many predict the technology will play an important enterprise role in coming years.    "I think we\'re within a couple of years of seeing (corporate blockchain use) in limited ways and probably five years before you start to see true transformation happening with it," Jim Whitehurst, CEO of software firm Red Hat, told CNBC\'s "Squawk Alley" on Thursday.    "The technology is extraordinary: Recognize that it\'s not just for currency, it\'s a way to complete transactions, whether that\'s a mortgage contract or a stock trade or two individuals exchanging money," he said. "It allows it to happen at a much more efficient way without central parties in the middle."    In fact, IBM said Friday that it had opened a blockchain "garage" in New York to help clients, including BNY Mellon, determine the best ways to use the technology.    "With this new initiative, IBM is providing an environment that will allow companies like us to collaborate more easily and more securely and in a more standardized way, which is critical to advancing meaningful use cases for blockchain," BNY Mellon Chief Information Officer Suresh Kumar said in a statement.    And in another sign that many are betting on the technology, blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused firm Digital Currency Group announced Thursday a group of new investors including Western Union, and a new senior adviser \u2014 former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

Offshore accounts are a traditional way for the wealthy to diversify the location of their investments, benefit from lower tax rates or enjoy lower regulatory oversight.     However, one financial intelligence expert told CNBC that companies and investors could now gain the same benefits from tapping the digital currency sector as from offshoring \u2014 and that clued-up ones had probably already opted to do so.       "Maybe companies that had to appear legitimate would have done it (invested in traditional offshore accounts), but really, those just wanting to park money? \u2026 I don\'t think that\'s being done now by the smart ones," Scott Dueweke, the founder of Zebryx, a digital identity consultancy, said on Tuesday.    The offshore holdings of 140 public figures came to light as a result of the leak from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.   Cryptocurrencies, which only exist online count as digital currencies, but the term also encapsulates fiat currencies when used for online payment and virtual currencies used in online gaming. Digital-only currencies like bitcoin are characterized by their anonymity, with neither payers nor payees required to identify themselves and the system open for anybody to use.     Financial authorities fear this makes them open to abuse for money laundering and criminal and terrorist financing and are increasingly looking to regulate the online platforms that exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat ones.    "There is a shadow banking system that now exists around the world that is capable of moving unlimited amounts of money\u2026 They (criminals) know the banking system is well monitored," Dueweke, who has advised the U.S. government and international law enforcement agencies, told CNBC.     With that in mind, he said that offshoring scandals like the Panama Papers would likely be consigned to history.      "I don\'t think they are going to happen 10 years from now \u2014 because why would they bother doing that anymore?" he said.    In October, a report from the U.K. Treasury and Home Office concluded digital currencies were already the preferred method of online payment for illicit goods like firearms and drugs. The report added that the money laundering risk associated with digital currencies was low, but could rise if their use became more prevalent.     A few months later, in January, Dutch authorities arrested 10 people accused of running a bitcoin laundering ring.    Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Blockchain \u2013 the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency bitcoin \u2013 is unlikely to kill banks despite warnings from top industry executives, the chair of a bitcoin non-profit organization told CNBC on Monday.    Last week, Andrey Sharov, a vice president at Russia\'s Sberbank, said banks would disappear by 2026 due to the rising use of blockchain technology.    "In 10 years, there will be no banks, I\'m afraid," according to a translation of Sharov\'s comments by the Coinfox bitcoin news website.     But Brock Pierce, the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, said that while the adoption of blockchain will hit parts of a bank, it will ultimately create opportunity.    "There are certain aspects of their business that are going to be negatively impacted, but there are also going to be other business units that are going to be positively impacted and new business units that get created that might not even exist today," Pierce told CNBC in an interview on Monday.    "And the parts of the industry that are being most negatively impacted are the ones where the bank is not providing much in the way of value, where they are being a toll taker but not really a value creator."   Blockchain is the technology that underlies the cryptocurrency bitcoin. It works like a huge, decentralized ledger for bitcoin which records every transaction and stores this information on a global network so it cannot be tampered with. Banks feel blockchain technology can be utilized in areas from remittances to securities exchanges to bring about efficiency.     The Bitcoin Foundation positions itself as an organization that is helping to advance the use of the cryptocurrency "through advocacy, education and support of adoption and core development", according to its website. While there is no centralized authority for bitcoin, the organization is trying to create common standards for its use. How blockchain can benefit banks Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, explains how blockchain can reduce post-trade processing costs for banks.   Pierce has a varied history. He was a child film star who appeared in Disney\'s "The Mighty Ducks" film in the early 1990s. He has previously run internet companies and is a partner in Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in companies in the space.    A number of major financial institutions have been speaking publically about blockchain and touting its potential. A firm called R3 has brought together a group of the world\'s biggest banks including JPMorgan and Citigroup and is dedicated to researching and delivering new financial technology. Another company called Digital Asset Holdings, founded by an ex-top JPMorgan executive, partnered with JPMorgan earlier this year to explore blockchain technology.    Speaking at the Money 2020 conference in Copenhagen last week, Digital Asset Holdings chief executive Blythe Masters, said blockchain technology will be "deployed in a commercial setting in less than a couple of years," but widespread adoption would take longer, a point Pierce echoed.    "I think banks are going to take a while to integrate this \u2026 it\'s going to take them years of testing before they start to commercialize aspects of the technology \u2026 it\'s more likely to have an impact in other industries in the short term which are less-regulated and where the stakes are lower," Pierce told CNBC.    Pierce also explained that there would be "dozens of different versions of blockchains" deployed for different use cases.    The Bitcoin Foundation has had a checkered history. In December, Pierce declared in meeting minutes that the organization was "close to running out of money."    And bitcoin itself has had a bad reputation. The cryptocurrency is often linked to allowing people to purchase illegal items anonymously, while one of the world\'s largest bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, collapsed in 2014.     While not referring to these specific incidents, Pierce did admit that bitcoin\'s reputation has suffered some bad publicity, and why the banks are focusing on the underlying technology of blockchain.    "Bitcoin\'s got a major PR (public relations) problem and that\'s why you hear major banks saying bitcoin bad, blockchain good," Pierce said.    "Emerging technologies and the earliest adopters often produce these types of messages. And bitcoin as the pioneer takes the arrows in the back\u2026which is probably not warranted."

Bitcoin, the revolutionary technological innovation, is becoming old hat. Even while investors and regulators are paying much more attention (and more money) to the technological architecture underpinning the cryptocurrency, a funny thing is happening: Bitcoin, the very reason for that architecture, is often going completely unmentioned.   That\'s not to say that bitcoin is becoming less popular as a means of exchange or a store of value \u2014 it\'s price in U.S. dollars is hovering near a one-year high \u2014 but people are increasingly showing much more interest in other potential applications of secure distributed ledgers (also called blockchains), which have nothing to do with money. It\'s that innovation \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 that allows for the bitcoin network\'s global functioning. It securely records information publicly, and concurrently hosts those records on separate computers. And while many have argued that a blockchain is fundamentally insecure without bitcoin\'s diverse network participants incentivized by monetary reward, not everyone agrees.   "For currency and as a financial rail, bitcoin is the only game in town," said Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, which oversees 68 companies in the virtual currency and associated technologies space. "But as a ledger, I think that most of the efforts underway by the banks are using permissioned or federated blockchain solutions."    In other words, as financial institutions grow to appreciate the efficiencies they can achieve through the technology \u2014 cutting out the middlemen of data transfer while keeping information secure \u2014 they\'re opting to keep everything in house.     This trend, Silbert said, is because the firms want to make sure their systems will be scalable, easily audited and definitely around in 30 years. (Bitcoin\'s future remains in flux, especially as some of its biggest developers battle over the details of its protocol.)    The blockchain-sans-bitcoin discussion was exemplified on Tuesday when Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo spoke at length about the potential of DLT (digital ledger technology) before the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.\'s Blockchain Symposium. Despite singing the praises of blockchains, he neglected to mention bitcoin once in his official transcript.    "It will have profound implications for global financial markets by increasing settlement efficiency and speed, linking recordkeeping networks, reducing transaction costs and increasing market access," Giancarlo said, according to a transcript of his remarks. "It will broadly impact financial markets in payments, banking, securities settlement, title recording, cyber security and trade reporting and analysis."    The shift in focus to non-bitcoin DLT\'s can also be seen in the massive increase in the price of "ether" \u2014 a digital token, not the organic compounds. This token, which serves as a sort of "fuel" for the blockchain-based application platform Ethereum, broke above $14 earlier this month after beginning the year under $1.   Ethereum, the development of which CNBC reported on in 2014, is a decentralized platform running on its own blockchain (not bitcoin\'s) that allows for developers to create blockchain-based applications. The Ethereum Foundation emphasizes on its website that ether is not meant to be competition to bitcoin, nor is it "intended to be used as or considered a currency, asset, share or anything else," but that desire has apparently been ignored. The dramatic price increase shows that some are speculating on ether, and a recent New York Times report called Ethereum a "rival virtual currency" to bitcoin.    "I\'m excited about Ethereum, I\'m excited about the community," Silbert said, but he acknowledged that he is concerned about the dramatic price increase. "Quite a bit of speculative trading is going on in ether without there yet being a way to calculate the fundamental intrinsic value of it."    If those buying ether believe it will be used as fuel to pay for new applications\' computing costs, it\'s unclear how much will be needed in this early stage of the ecosystem\'s development, Silbert said, so valuation is impossible. On the other hand, he added, the use-case for ether as a better means of exchange than bitcoin does not yet exist, and there\'s been no decision on the final system of supply (unlike the bitcoin protocol), so it\'s risky as a speculation.    Still, those buying up ether are not the first to see potential in the Ethereum platform.    One source with knowledge of Ethereum\'s beginnings told CNBC in 2014 that some investment offers valued the project at about $500 million, and that Google Ventures was one of the interested parties. "That\'s a big number, isn\'t it? That\'s an impressive number?" Ethereum\'s then-chief communications officer Stephan Tual said about the figure, adding that "I don\'t think the concept would work if we had accepted money."

A new virtual gold rush is underway.    Even as Bitcoin, riven by internal divisions, has struggled, a rival virtual currency \u2014 known as Ethereum \u2014 has soared in value, climbing 1,000 percent over the last three months.   Read more from The New York Times:    Beyond the price spike, Ethereum is also attracting attention from giants in finance and technology, like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM, which have described it as a sort of Bitcoin 2.0.   The rise of the relatively new virtual currency has been helped by a battle within the Bitcoin community over how the basic Bitcoin software should develop.   The fights have slowed down Bitcoin transactions and led some people to look for alternative virtual currencies to power their businesses. Enter Ethereum.    Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. The promise of such a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen.   But Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.   The system is complicated enough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain English. But one application in development would let farmers put their produce up for sale directly to consumers and take payment directly from consumers. There are already dozens of functioning applications built on Ethereum, enabling new ways to manage and pay for electricity, sports bets and even Ponzi schemes.    All of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin.   Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system.   But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things.    Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure.   "Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution \u2014 the most elegant solution we have seen to date," said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft.   Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft\'s work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository.   Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together \u2014 somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users.    Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system \u2014 known as an Ether \u2014 that people have recently been buying.   The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, "Blockchain: Tapping Into the Real Potential, Cutting Through the Hype."   Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain.   Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress\'s investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a "significant" purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry\'s chatter about the virtual currency has evolved.   "A lot of the more established players were thinking, \'It\'s still an experiment,\' " he said. "It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation."    Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week.    Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum.    Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario.   The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain \u2014 the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source \u2014 say, The Associated Press \u2014 the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet.   The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether.    A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin\'s team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software\'s development.   Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers \u2014 or nodes \u2014 helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes.   One of Mr. Buterin\'s co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing.    The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around.   Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets.   "Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision," he said.   Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin.   It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned.   "Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years," Mr. Bonneau said. "It will depend if any real markets develop around it.

Digital publishers lost an estimated $22 billion in revenue in 2015 due to ad-blocking technology with around 198 million global users using the software, according to PageFair, which provides solutions to counter ad blocking.    The problem for publishers is likely to get worse as more and more companies, such as Samsung and Three, announce plans to let users block online advertisements.    "Several companies have jumped on the ad-blocking bandwagon," said Daniel Knapp, director of analysis at IHS Technology, to CNBC in an email.     "Ad blocking is an expression of massive consumer dissatisfaction with the way the ad industry works."    One alternative to funding content besides ads would be a system of micropayments, where users pay a small fee for each page they view, according to David Schatsky, senior manager of emerging technology and business trends at Deloitte.    "You could have an option to not view advertising and instead pay a couple of pennies per page as you go," he told CNBC in a phone interview.     He explained that micropayments - facilitated by bitcoin \u2013 could be given to a publisher for the time a user spends on their site.     According to Schatsky, using the cryptocurrency bitcoin would make a micropayment system feasible due to its low transaction costs. The blockchain, meanwhile, which is the underlying technology behind bitcoin that works like a huge, decentralized ledger recording every transaction, would be able to keep secure records of which pages are viewed and for how long.    The main appeal of a micropayment system would be to give more choice to content consumers.    "Publishers who find a way of creating choice for users, most of whom are reasonable and recognize that it costs money to host content, you can imagine them opting into another program where rather than blocking ads they simply pay a nominal amount for the privilege of viewing content and they won\'t see the ads anymore," added Schatsky.

Financial technology firm R3 CEV, which brought together the banks last year to work on blockchain applications, announced the move Thursday.     Blockchain works like a huge, decentralized ledger for the digital currency bitcoin, recording every transaction and stores this information on a global network so it cannot be tampered with. However, most experts agree that the technology is not close to mass adoption and is still just in the trial phase.     The technology can be potentially be applied to wide array of uses and, for financial firms, some of the most interesting areas involve the clearing of trades. Experts say the blockchain will allow a large number of transactions to be settled in a matter of minutes or even seconds as well as being more secure, since each transaction is recorded and cannot be tampered with. At the moment, the process of settling some trades can take days.   Underpinning this is the idea of "smart contracts" \u2014 a computer code that would only execute when the terms of a contract are met. For example, a trade may be carried out once the money from the buyer has been received. This would all be done automatically and would not be up for dispute since it would be recorded in the blockchain.     For this trial, a number of distributed ledger companies worked with the banks \u2014 Chain, Eris Industries, Ethereum, IBM and Intel. The institutions did an assessment of each company\'s smart contract solution to trade fixed income.     "This development further supports R3\'s belief that close collaboration among global financial institutions and technology providers will create significant momentum behind the adoption of distributed ledger solutions across the industry," R3 CEO David Rutter said in a statement.    "These technologies represent a new frontier of innovation and will dramatically improve the way the financial services industry operates, in much the same way as the advent of electronic trading decades ago delivered huge advancements in efficiency, transparency, scalability and security."

Bitcoin, itself, is a virtual currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. Several organisations have looked into alternative applications for the blockchain, away from the digital currency. For instance, Nasdaq is trialling a system to allow investors to securely vote in shareholders meetings, while Bank of America has filed several blockchain related patents.   Some of the possible benefits of adopting blockchain include simplifying business processes and creating trusted, safe records of business agreements and transactions, according to Vijay Michalik, research analyst for consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan.     In the longer term, blockchain may even replace law contracts and written agreements with computer code.    "This would challenge trusted third party business models like eBay, Amazon and Uber by creating a way for buyers and sellers to interact safely without the costs of a platform," he told CNBC via email.     "Early forms of these decentralized autonomous businesses are already emerging." However, businesses may need to be cautious, as Michalik highlighted several issues with adopting blockchain technology.   "The challenges of legacy infrastructure will be the main obstacle. This is coupled with the challenges of technical understanding \u2013 the practicality of implementing decentralized cryptosystems falls outside of the traditional IT development skill-set," he said.  "Companies from Consensys and Microsoft to IBM are beginning to release some of the tools needed, but conceptual understanding of its potential is a separate hurdle. "  Market researcher TABB Group has also identified several challenges facing different sectors of the market, which it describes as "insurmountable," in a report published earlier this month.   "While some issues are significant to particular market slices, they may be non-issues for others, and things that may appear easy from the outside, may actually be very challenging," said Larry Tabb, CEO of TABB Group in a press release.   "For example, streamlining the allocations process may appear simple from a brokerage or custodian perspective, but problematic for investors; conversely, clearing and netting is a non-issue for investors while challenging for banks and brokers."

What we\'re doing is protecting their position in the economy, says Bullard.   The nation\'s megabanks need to be split up like the old AT&T monopoly in order to foster innovation in the new digital age at the intersection of financial services and information technology, St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard said Thursday.    "You broke that thing up and what did you get? You got all the phones we\'re talking about this morning," said Bullard, arguing the environment created by the 1984 dismantling of AT&T gave rise to the cellphone revolution.    The banking industry could experience the same type of transformative moment if the big financial institutions were broken up, he told CNBC\'s "Squawk Box," as part of a wide-ranging interview. "You have more firms. You take off some of the regulation. You let them do whatever the heck they want. You get more innovation," he said.   The tighter banking regulations after the financial crisis have not solved the "too big to fail" problem, said Bullard, a longtime advocate of smaller banks and a voting member this year on the Federal Reserve\'s policymaking committee. But he admitted banks are safer today than they were in 2007 and 2008.    He said, "We had to implement Dodd-Frank," referring to the financial reform law that in part requires large banks to hold more just-in-case capital, so American taxpayers would not be on the hook to bail them out if there were another global shock.     "You [still] have very big firms that are unlikely to innovate into the future," Bullard said. "We\'re writing all these laws, all these detailed things, about exactly what they are doing today without much thought about what they\'re going to do tomorrow."    Bullard\'s position echos what Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, the newest central bank policymaker, told "Squawk Box" last week. Pointing to the role smaller banks can play in the system, Kashkari said that the big institutions are still "too big to fail" and that he\'s going to work with experts to help craft by the end of the year a plan to address the problem "once and for all."   Pointing to the smaller banks, Kashkari said they are still "too big to fail" and that he\'s going to work with experts to help craft by the end of the year a plan to address the problem "once and for all."    In a speech the day before appearing on CNBC, Kashkari urged Congress to consider bold rules, including breaking up the largest banks or turning the institutions into "utilities" by creating huge cash cushions so they can\'t fail. Such rules would go further than the post-crisis Dodd-Frank regulations.    In the meantime, "the Financial Stability Oversight Committee, they\'re naming particular firms as being \'too big to fail.\' In some ways, that\'s ensconcing the status of these firms as if it\'s going to be the same companies for the next 50 years or 100 years," Bullard said.    Companies with a designation of "too big to fail," or more formally referred to as a "systemically important financial institution," are required, among other things, to hold more capital.    Bullard said Kashkari has the right idea. "You\'ve got to think more deeply about this longer term. Whatever you think about Dodd-Frank, it\'s about how you\'re going to get the innovation." Bullard cited cutting-edge ideas surrounding virtual currencies like bitcoin and peer-to-peer lending as examples.    Regulators, policymakers and legislators need to foster an environment so these kinds of advancements start in the United States, Bullard said, giving U.S. banks a further leg up on the "bureaucratic nightmares" in China and their closely tied to government counterparts in Europe.

Estonia offers e-Residency which is a transnational digital identity available to people who start a business online in the nation. But if those people own stock in an Estonian publically listed firm, they need to be physically present to vote in shareholder meetings or nominate someone else to do it for them, an arduous process.     But the Nasdaq, using blockchain technology, is hoping to change that.     Blockchain works like a huge, decentralized ledger for the digital currency bitcoin which records every transaction and stores this information on a global network so it cannot be tampered with. It\'s this technology that Nasdaq is now applying to shareholder votes.   In this case, a user would have a so-called private key, a unique long number given to them provided they are listed on the e-Residency records held by the Estonian government. This record will be sealed on the blockchain and cannot be tampered with. This private key would need to be used to validate yourself whenever you go to vote in a shareholders meeting online.     Essentially the blockchain would allow companies to know for sure that the person voting online is the person they say they are, due to the private key needed to take part.   "The decentralized nature of identity manager makes it harder to falsify identity and much more difficult to duplicate a vote as there is one ledger that is the single source of truth," Alexander Shelkovnikov, corporate venturing and blockchain lead at Deloitte, told CNBC by phone.     The blockchain used by Estonian companies would be private and only accessible to those who are using it. The companies that would take part would be on Nasdaq\'s Tallin Stock Exchange, Estonia\'s only regulated securities market. The pilot is aiming to launch later this year.    Blockchain has been a big buzzword among major financial institutions. A number of banks have been looking into using the technology and investing in start-ups in the space. And this is not the first time that Nasdaq has used the blockchain. Last year, the firm used the blockchain to complete and record a private securities transaction.     Shelkovnikov said that this is not just an Estonian-specific use case, but could be used for different processes, including voting in elections.    "Electronic voting, it does not just apply to stock exchange, but it could apply to what we do regularly by voting for individuals or parties," Shelkovnikov said.

Nowadays, most artists have side ventures in music (of course), apparel, food and beverages. Yet however impressive their individual business prowess, few of them are able to call themselves full-fledged investors in Silicon Valley start-ups.    Count Nasir Jones, the multiplatinum-selling rapper better known by his stage moniker "Nas," among that elite group. The Queens, New York-bred artist who first hit the charts more than 20 years ago has quietly metamorphosed into a prolific angel investor \u2014 founding the venture capital firm QueensBridge Venture Partners. The firm (not to be confused with the hip-hop supergroup Jones fronted back in the \'90s) funnels cash into start-ups as varied as health care, financial technology and Bitcoin.    QueensBridge, based in Los Angeles, invests in more than 40 start-ups across a range of sectors like financial technology, health care and music production. That has helped put Jones in the same strata as Ashton Kutcher and U2 frontman Bono as the tech world\'s most influential celebrity investors.   Read MoreChina\'s tech elite like a new asset class: Start-ups    So in a complex sector where billions are harvested \u2014 and cash hungry start-ups are born and buried in the blink of an eye \u2014 how does one of rap\'s living legends define his investment philosophy? Jones\' answer is surprisingly simple.    "People. That is the absolute No. 1," Jones told CNBC via email. "I love to bet on great people that inspire me and make me think or see things differently."     A big part of that has to do with the management team, Jones added, which "makes a huge difference in the kinds of companies that will stick out to me."    Some of the companies that have grabbed the artist\'s attention include Silicon Valley darlings like Lyft, Dropbox, Coinbase and Tradesy, all of which are part of QueensBridge\'s investment bailiwick.    The ride-sharing service and online storage provider are among technology\'s biggest "unicorns" \u2014 private startups valued at least $1 billion \u2014 and are poised to become publicly-traded companies once the current downturn subsides. One of QueensBridge\'s latest investments is LANDR, a start-up that uses big data and artificial intelligence to produce music. LANDR has raised more than $8 million from various sources in the last few years, including Jones\' firm.    Silicon Valley is a long way from the rough and tumble world of the New York City neighborhood that\'s interwoven in the lore of Jones\' musical mythology. The 42-year-old artist, an autodidact who dropped out of school after the eighth grade, told CNBC his affinity for learning led him to technology investing.    "I\'ve always wanted to be surrounded by the smartest people in the world, and didn\'t want to limit that to just music," he wrote to CNBC.     "I want to meet the people who are innovating in all different fields, and investing lets me do that," Jones said. "I meet the people that are changing the game across all different industries, and I get to be there first at the ground level. It\'s helped me to progress tremendously in my business."    Despite the recent downturn in the market, it\'s been a lucrative time to be a technology investor. Last year was a record for venture capital, with more than $128 billion finding their way to a range of companies worldwide, according to data from KPMG Enterprise and CB Insights. Funds for small start-ups, otherwise known as angel investments, have boomed into a $24 billion market by itself, the Center for Venture Research says.   QueensBridge is pitched by more than 100 companies per month, and invests in only a small fraction of them. Anthony Saleh, Jones\' manager and partner at QueensBridge, told CNBC in a recent interview that the firm invests from $100,000 to $500,000 in a company, and has done more than 100 deals in the last six years.     Overall, QueensBridge invests in about 20 per year, Saleh said, adding that the firm is "much more top-down than bottom-up as investors. We concentrate on idea or the product, how big the market is and how the founding team is."  Read MoreTech firms face funding \'Hunger Games\'   The due diligence process, Saleh told CNBC, can be at least as qualitative as quantitative. Investing in a potential company can include intangibles like "experience, grit, life motivation \u2026 those are keys to what we look at. Then we look at how those things kind of mesh."     Even in the freewheeling world of tech companies, corporate governance is a critical ingredient, he added.     "Nas\' biggest fear is investing in a company" where the leadership may be unethical, Saleh told CNBC. "He tends to ask more questions about that."    QueensBridge, along with a clutch of other firms such as Warner Music Group, Real Ventures and YUL Ventures, recently invested in LANDR, where CEO Pascal Pilon fused his training in software engineering with business.     LANDR is Pilon\'s second start-up, and the post music-production service helps master music for more than 300,000 musicians. Mastering is the final step in music production that happens after you record all of the parts and mix them together.    "We felt there was lots of room for musicians to embrace this thing," Pilon told CNBC in a recent interview.      Given the expense and cumbersome effort involved in creating music masters, "Some musicians have never felt the instant gratification of completing a song, and don\'t have the money to release more songs," and LANDR helps them get there.    That argument cuts to the heart of the notion embraced by Jones and his team at QueensBridge: that a start-up investment is more than just about financial gain.    "I think anyone can be involved with investing if they have the means, but I\'d advise anyone who wants to invest to be careful. You have to study it," Jones said. "It\'s not easy to find the projects that are going to generate a return, and you have to invest your time and energy \u2014 not just your money \u2014 into researching the companies that are going to do big things."

The Bitcoin Group, based in Melbourne, Australia, announced on Tuesday that it had raised 5,927,168.40 Australian dollars in a bookbuild for its listing on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).       Although the amount raised was less than a third of the target, Bitcoin Group CEO Sam Lee said it was a "solid result."     "It is sufficient for the company to execute its current strategy of expanding our footprint through acquiring new mining equipment," he told CNBC on Tuesday.   Read MoreBitcoin: CNBC Explains   Bitcoin is a digital currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. Because there is no central bank, bitcoins are "released" online through a process known as mining. The process is carried out by a decentralized network of computers, which compete with one another to match transactions with the amount of the currency in circulation. Whichever computer gets the calculations correct, can then claim the transaction fees on the newly released bitcoins.     Bitcoin Group is yet to quote on the ASX, although this was scheduled to take place on Tuesday. It is expected to trade under the ticker BCG.     Shares were priced at 0.20 Australian dollars, with minimum subscription of 2,000 Australian dollars and no maximum subscription.

Lee\'s background is in financial services and digital media.     There are a number of concerns surrounding bitcoin: It is renowned for its volatility and has been heavily criticized for facilitating illegal activity, given that it can be used anonymously. There is  also high competition in the industry and uncertainty regarding the regulatory and legal treatment of the currency. The Australian Taxation Office\'s stance is that bitcoin is an asset for capital gains tax purposes.    "As an investor I would think twice before investing in a bitcoin mining company," Nicholas Debock, a venture capitalist at Balderton Capital in London, told CNBC on Tuesday.     "Overall, in the bitcoin space, we saw a lot of venture capitalists investing in bitcoin in the last three years, but we don\'t yet see money coming out," he later added.

If the company had raised the hoped-for 20 million Australian dollars, it planned to use 18 million Australian dollars to invest in mining equipment and facilities, with 2 million Australian dollars for general corporate purposes, including listing costs.

Bank of America is trying to steal a march on the latest developments in the technology behind digital currency bitcoin by loading up on blockchain-related patents.    Blockchain works like a huge, decentralized ledger for the digital currency bitcoin which records every transaction and stores this information on a global network so it cannot be tampered with.     Major financial institutions -- including the Bank of England -- have released a number of notes over the last year on the potential of the technology and have created teams within their organizations to look into how to develop the cryptocurrency.    But Bank of America is going one step further by attempting to patent some of the use cases of the technology. The company has already filed for 15 blockchain-related patents and is currently in the process of drafting another 20 to be submitted to the U.S. Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO) later this month, a spokesperson told CNBC on Wednesday.     "Blockchain\'s very intriguing and for us it\'s a balance between not wanting to be Neanderthal but not wanting to put something out in a commercial application where the commercial application is still very unclear as a technologist, the technology is fascinating," Catherine Bessant, the chief operations and technology office at Bank of America, said during a CNBC event at Davos last week.     "And we have tried to stay on the forefront, I think we have somewhere around 15 patents, most people would be surprised at Bank of America with patents in the blockchain or cryptocurrency space. (It\'s) very important in the intellectual property world to reserve our spot even before we know what the commercial application might be."   In December, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published 10 of Bank of America\'s applications. The USPTO publishes patent applications 18 months after they\'re filed. But the latest information shows that the number of patents Bank of America has filed for and is looking to apply for is much higher.     Bank of America patents published by the USPTO showed proposals for a "cryptocurrency risk detection system" and "suspicious user alert system" among others. These patents have not yet been granted.     The technology might be some years off before becoming mainstream for banks, but institutions are taking a collaborative approach to the technology, working with start-ups and even rival lenders. A consortium of more than 25 banks, led by fintech (financial technology) company R3, is currently developing a framework for applying blockchain technology to markets.    Last year, Goldman Sachs released a note that said blockchain could "change everything" while banks from Barclays to UBS explained how the technology could be used in areas from remittances to drawing up contracts.

CNBC explains bitcoin, a payment system that uses virtual money for online transactions. It\'s like cash for the internet transferred by a mobile app or computer program. The identities and transactions are kept completely anonymous.   There\'s been a lot written about the death of bitcoin of late.    The digital currency has either failed, or is on the verge of collapse, according to op-eds and quotes in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Week, The Guardian, Fortune and more. All of these articles hinged on the decision of an influential developer in the bitcoin community to leave the space behind \u2014 a move he announced with a blog post.  Despite the technical-sounding nature of those pronouncements, the reasons why former Google programmer Mike Hearn decided bitcoin had "failed" are a complicated story of competing business interests and philosophical considerations that some contend have been blown out of proportion.   "I\'m not concerned in the slightest," said Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group \u2014 a firm that oversees 62 companies in the virtual currency and associated technologies space. "In the short history of bitcoin it has been declared dead 90 times ... and every week there\'s something new that leads certain people to believe that bitcoin is failing or failed, and in my experience so far, everything that doesn\'t kill bitcoin makes it stronger."    In his post entitled "The resolution of the Bitcoin experiment," Hearn focuses on the decision-making process around bitcoin\'s so-called block size debate \u2014 the ongoing disagreement within the community about how to store transaction data.    The question is how to best structure bitcoin\'s underlying blockchain (composed of sequential "blocks" of information). The current maximum size of 1 megabyte per block only allows about seven transactions per second, and some in the community say that\'s too slow for bitcoin\'s continued growth.    The debate is as much philosophical as it is technical: Some are seemingly content for bitcoin to act like an investable commodity \u2014 not necessitating quick transactions \u2014 while others want it to compete with the likes of Visa as an international transaction network. But no matter where they fall in the debate, most members of the community say the media\'s coverage distorts the seriousness of the disagreement.    "It\'s been blown way out of proportion," Silbert said. "I don\'t think this is going to be a permanent stalemate, but even if it were, there\'s not an expiration date for bitcoin."    If bitcoin traffic continues to grow without a solution, experts say, then transaction fees would likely rise along with increasingly unpredictable payment settlement times. But that\'s unlikely to be a permanent state of affairs, according to Pete Rizzo, editor of digital currency-focused CoinDesk, who said the community agrees broadly that the network needs to be scaled. The war on bitcoin Simon Dixon, CEO & co-founder at BnkToTheFuture.com, says a syndicate of major banks are attempting to develop their own version of bitcoin, the online crypto-currency, which would benefit banks rather than consumers.    Just how that occurs, however, remains up for debate. Some proposals seek to skirt the issue of block size entirely by increasing transaction capacity in other ways, and others are seeking to promote a new version of bitcoin that hasn\'t been approved by the open source protocol\'s longtime core developers.    But Hearn\'s complaints were about more than just the merits of proposals for bitcoin\'s data storage process. He objected to the way that the core developers required "consensus" on every decision, and insinuated that some of them were intentionally stymieing the discussion.    Wary of increased media attention, in part brought about by Hearn, some of the businesses in the bitcoin space have come out in support of a proposal that may attempt to circumvent the core developers. This, in turn, is creating divisions in the community that threaten its growth (although probably not its survival).    "The media has certainly created the perception that bitcoin is stalling or has failed, and that perception was created because a lot of the reporting was based on the claims of one developer," Rizzo said. "That has put political pressure on the industry, given them a problem that is not technical, but purely political."  For his part, SIlbert \u2014 who is one of the biggest players in the space \u2014 said he is declining to take sides, but expects that the community will come to a workable solution.   And while political considerations may rile up the community, it\'s not immediately obvious that they will lead to the failure of the entire network. In fact, while bitcoin\'s price saw a big one-day drop after Hearn\'s exit from about $430 to less than $360, the price has largely recovered to nearly $420.    Daily transactions, number of users, merchant acceptances and venture capital investments have also all hit record highs since the block size debate began, according to Silbert. And while financial professionals outside of the bitcoin community have noticed recent news reports about its supposed failure, he said, those potential investors "are becoming a bit numb to both positive and negative headlines" \u2014 a potential sign of maturity in the space.    In fact, when interviewed via email in August, Hearn told CNBC the bitcoin network would continue to function no matter how the block size debate was decided \u2014 but its growth could become stalled.    "Well, Bitcoin will still exist no matter what happens. But obviously if there\'s no chance of growth and the community decides to follow the Bitcoin Core developers (without even knowing who exactly is in that group), then a whole lot of other developers and entrepreneurs will leave," Hearn said. "Because you can\'t build a successful business on an infrastructure with no chances of growth."    But even if the current debates, and Hearn\'s exit, are not bitcoin\'s death knell, that doesn\'t mean the digital currency is destined for long-term success.    "I still maintain that, from the price perspective, bitcoin has a binary outcome: It is either going to zero or it\'s going much higher," Silbert said. "Discussions and debates are just a healthy part of the process."

The company also launched Citi Mobile Challenge, a way for individuals to re-imagine mobile banking.     But Wall Street\'s adoption of technology doesn\'t just stop there. In recent months, there\'s been a migration between Silicon Valley and banking, underscoring how the latter is becoming a talent pool for the industry\'s heavy hitters.

Bitcoin may have risen over 35 percent so far this year, but it\'s the underlying technology behind the cryptocurrency that is exciting the world\'s major banks.     Called the blockchain, it has been heralded as a potentially disruptive force in finance by major institutions, which claim that bitcoin is just the "opening act" in something bigger.   Blockchain works like a huge, decentralized ledger for the digital currency bitcoin which records every transaction and stores this information on a global network so it cannot be tampered with. It\'s this technology that banks feel can be utilized in areas from remittances to securities exchanges.    Currently, a consortium of more than 25 banks, led by fintech (financial technology) company R3, is developing a framework for applying blockchain technology to markets.    CNBC highlights what some of these major banks have been saying this year about the potential of the blockchain.    "What if I told you that bitcoin was just the opening act \u2026 with the blockchain ready to take center stage," Goldman Sachs said in a note in December, adding that the technology could "change everything."     Goldman Sachs noted a number of industries and uses that the blockchain could be applied to including voting systems, vehicle registrations, wire fees, gun checks, trade settlements and cataloguing ownership of art works.    "By removing the need for a middle man, one lowers potential security concerns from hacking to corruption as well as speeding up manual processes that are antiquated and can take too long," the investment bank said.    JPMorgan has spent about $9 billion this year on technology investments across the company and a big focus has been on the blockchain.     In a note to employees, which was given to CNBC, Daniel Pinto, the head of JPMorgan\'s corporate and investment bank, said the financial giant has established teams to look into the blockchain among other technology such as robotics.     Barclays said in May that bitcoin created a more "elegant solution than our current payment system" in many ways but it also "fell short" in a number of areas. The British bank said that it envisages a number of other cryptocurrencies will continue to emerge that won\'t have the flaws of first generation bitcoin, it said in the note.    So it\'s not predicting the end of cryptocurrencies but sees a place for them in the future of blockchain.     The first big area cryptocurrencies could work well in is bank transfers and remittances, according to Barclays, as it could make it cheaper and even "reduce the capital requirements of banks, as it would reduce considerably the counterparty risks."    A second area of interest is the use of blockchain in securities exchanges with Barclays saying the technology can be "been abstracted to carry any sort of asset which can be represented digitally."    A third area is in the registration of assets to help insurers keep track of objects, for example. An insurer could keep track of claims and if a car breaks down and an insurer pays for the repairs, both events could be recorded on the blockchain, so it would be more difficult to make a second claim.    Other examples Barclays includes is being able to create "tamper-proof" online voting and supply chain management.     UBS has been one of the most open banks about its plans with the blockchain. It has a team called "Crypto 2.0" in London conducting research on the technology.    The Swiss investment bank said it has explored more than 20 use cases of blockchain and is incubating the best ideas.    One of the experiments it carried out was with so-called "smart contracts" which it developed into a "smart bond". This involved using the blockchain to recreate a bond\'s issuance, interest calculation, coupon payments and maturation processes.  UBS said in this scenario there was no need for pre and post trade intermediaries as the software on the blockchain was specifically configured to automatically handle the flow of information and money between the issuer and the buyer. The test required the creation of a virtual coin which it called "bondcoin", which enabled the transfer of value between the parties. Rather than a new virtual currency, bondcoin is linked to real-world currencies and connected to a central bank account.     In an October issue of Deutsche Bank\'s Flow magazine, the German institution said it had explored an "innovation lab" to investigate the potential of the blockchain.     Deutsche Bank highlighted that the adoption of the blockchain would face "significant legal and regulatory barriers" but recognized that it could be massively disruptive to banks.     "On one level, this is a wake-up call to the banking industry. Buying and selling across the globe with a cryptocurrency requires no identification, no bank account and no credit card. It pays no foreign exchange fees or banking charges, meaning you could be a bitcoin billionaire without ever having spoken to a bank," the investment bank said.    "It could also, of course, be a threat to investments in Uber and Airbnb \u2013 and all fintech start-ups that are essentially intermediaries using banking\'s payment rails."

And while individual stocks have seen big pops on headlines, perhaps the best performing non-equity asset of the year is a favorite among crypto-anarchists.   Bitcoin, the digital currency heralded as a potential successor to the global monetary system, is up about 37 percent against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year. The cryptocurrency went for about $313 at the beginning of the year, according to CoinDesk\'s composite price index, and is now changing hands at around $430.    Those huge gains come after starting the year on rocky footing: Bitcoin dipped to below $175 in mid-January. But after a few false starts, the digital currency has been largely gaining ground since the beginning of October.  (One of the few investment options with a comparable 2015 return is Argentina\'s benchmark Merval \u2014 up about 40 percent on the year. Although U.S. investors playing the Global X Argentina ETF would be disappointed by the fund\'s slight loss in 2015.)    It\'s hard to say what\'s actually caused Bitcoin\'s rise during the last three months of 2015.    In November, digital ecosystem observers told CNBC that a 70 percent one-month spike may have been caused in part by headlines like the Winklevoss twins launching their exchange and the Digital Currency Group announcing funding from Bain and MasterCard. Others suggested that the relatively lightly traded asset could have been jumping on speculators\' fear of missing out (FOMO).    For Brendan O\'Connor, the CEO of bitcoin trading firm Genesis Global Trading, the year-end run up was the result of a series of positive trends for the asset.    On the one hand, O\'Connor said, funding announcements from bitcoin-related start-ups helped to establish the legitimacy of the sector \u2014 and its underlying technology. This has helped push institutional investors into making investments in both the digital token and the over-the-counter Bitcoin Investment Trust (more on that ETF-like vehicle can be found here). Meet the blockchain The technology behind bitcoin could be even more important than the cryptocurrency itself.   "They\'re looking for investments in non-correlated asset classes," O\'Connor said, explaining that financial firms regularly come to his office to learn how to trade bitcoin. "I still think that by and large they\'re viewing it as a speculative investment, but I think that their willingness to test the waters has increased dramatically."    Another important trend in the space has been the gradually increasing interest the technology \u2014 and it\'s negligible fee structure \u2014 for remittance payments and as a daily currency in monetarily challenged parts of the world, O\'Connor said.    That potential came to the forefront of the tech discussion during the summer\'s Greek crisis: When the country instituted capital controls in the face of increasingly dire eurozone negotiations, countless articles were written about bitcoin\'s potential for struggling citizens.    It\'s unclear if those prophecies ever came to any real fruition, but investors in the space say the positive press coverage at least boosted awareness of bitcoin\'s potential.    Finally, bitcoin may have simply benefited from the lack of any disastrous headlines. Many traders say the cryptocurrency has shed the pall of failed exchange Mt. Gox \u2014 which quickly shuttered in 2014 after saying it lost 850,000 bitcoins (worth about $365 million today).    Bitcoin\'s fall from more than $1,150 near the end of 2013 to this January\'s $200 levels represented the asset\'s "long winter," according to economist Tuur Demeester, editor-in-chief of bitcoin-focused Adamant Research. The story of 2015, therefore, has been a bottoming out for the digital asset, and a climb to revaluation.    Bitcoin\'s fall from its highs, Demeester said, was the result of "bubblicious" investing in 2013 (with some help from Mt. Gox). Pricing levels remained depressed for so long because companies had become over-leveraged, and so had been squeezed into heavy bitcoin selling, he said.    As for 2016, Demeester suggested that the cryptocurrency could likely see another leg up as newly confident investors seek the right market valuation.    "But," he said, "with bitcoin you have to expect to be surprised."

For an increasing number, however, the cryptocurrency is a tool for extortion.    Bitcoin has been used before in ransomware \u2014 a type of malware that restricts computer access unless a ransom is paid \u2014 but a new report from cyber intelligence firm Recorded Future details how criminals are increasingly turning to bitcoin as a means of payment for another kind of attacks.   "The adoption of bitcoin within the cyber extortion landscape is going to continue to grow," Tyler Bradshaw, the solutions engineer behind the report, told CNBC.   The Recorded Future report outlines how a group called DD4BC unleashed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against companies, lobbing massive amounts of digital requests at a service through a network of addresses in order to disrupt access for legitimate users.    The attackers, whose name stands for "DDoS for Bitcoin," would threaten companies with an upcoming attack, demanding a ransom paid in bitcoin in exchange for standing down. In a September report, Internet services provider Akamai revealed that it had recorded 141 attacks from the group.  Read MoreBitcoin now tax-free in Europe after court ruling    The publicity afforded to the group after that report\'s release may have led to copycat criminals, Bradshaw said. A new group called Armada Collective quickly sprang up, using the same methodology as DD4BC, and Recorded Future said it had discovered several recent Dark Web requests for information on how to conduct similar attacks.    The DDoS threats sometimes worked, as the attackers demanded relatively little money \u2014 usually between 10 and 200 bitcoin, or $4,100 to $82,000 at the current exchange rate.    A group calling itself Armada Collective \u2014 which may not be the one that originally claimed the name \u2014 appears to have upped the ante, demanding that three Greek banks each pay 20,000 bitcoins (worth more than $7 million at the time). Despite seeing disruptions in transactions for a period, all three banks declined to pay the ransom and employed protections against future DDoS attacks.  Banks to use bitcoin Capital markets could adopt the technology behind the virtual currency as early as next year, according to a report by TABB Research.   "Nevertheless, the DDoS threat landscape continues to evolve. While cyber extortion has been around for quite some time, the adoption of Bitcoin as a method of ransom will continue to attract new miscreants into the DDoS space," the Recorded Future report concluded.    Speaking with CNBC, Bradshaw said he thought the anonymity commonly associated with cryptocurrencies (of which bitcoin is the most popular) "is pretty enticing" for those considering cyber extortion. Earlier schemes relied on bank accounts or money orders, he said, so criminals felt they were at greater risk of being tracked down by authorities.    Bitcoin, however, is not even remotely an anonymous system. Law enforcement agencies have on multiple occasions traced bitcoin transactions to criminals. Famously, former FBI Special Agent Ilhwan Yum traced 3,760 bitcoin transactions from servers tied to the investigation of illicit online marketplace Silk Road to the laptop of Ross Ulbricht.  Read MoreBitcoin rockets higher, some blame pyramid scheme    In part on the basis of this testimony, a Manhattan court found that Ulbricht had been the mastermind behind the Silk Road, and consequently found him guilty on seven counts \u2014 including being a "drug kingpin." He was sentenced to life in prison.    That cautionary tail has not stopped some criminals from using the digital currency in brazen attacks such as those by DD4BC and the Armada Collective.    "Perhaps that might be something that might be a little misunderstood," Bradshaw said of authorities\' bitcoin tracing capabilities. Still, he said, the relatively minimal barriers to entry and the lack of personally identifiable information tied to bitcoin addresses make it appealing to hackers.

At least 100 banks have approached a bitcoin wallet provider about integrating the nascent transaction technology into their systems, according to the company\'s CEO.  Peter Smith, head of a company called Blockchain, thinks these banks could benefit from the technology used by the digital currency.

"It would be much, much more efficient and a lot more cost effective," he said.    According to Smith, many of the firms that have approached him are tier-one banks. He predicts it will take at least three years for the first banks to adopt the technology.    "We are doing some proof of concept with a few banks but I think it\'s going to be a really long road," he said. "I think the road to transformation for these big institutions is really political and I also think that (the banks) technology itself has some growth to do."    Smith\'s claims underlined a report from TABB Research released earlier this week.  TABB predicts some financial institutions will use blockchain technology as early as next year to track syndicated loan transactions. But it said that applying it to other sectors, such as derivatives and share trading, will take longer.    Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency itself is making a strong recovery from a low of $177 on January 14. It has climbed 88 percent since that trough, helped by a surge in June and July during market turmoil caused by China and expectations of Greece leaving the euro zone.

Bitcoin author Brian Kelly explains the meteoric rise in bitcoin, thanks in part to rising activity in China.    Bitcoin was surging again Wednesday, briefly approaching a $500 price as it jumped more than 20 percent on the day, and some are worried that something other than speculation may be behind the sharp gains \u2014 again.    The digital currency, which was up well more than 100 percent over the past month before giving back some of its gains Wednesday afternoon, saw a similarly begun spike near the end of 2013. At that time it climbed from about $120 to $1,150 in only a few months on the back of the first big wave of media attention, investor excitement and possibly some sort of fraud from now-defunct exchange Mt.Gox.    Now some are blaming this month\'s runup on a firm called MMM that appears to be a sort of self-admitted pyramid scheme: It says on its website that users donate money to the community in exchange for larger payouts in the future.  Bitcoin\'s prices spike 70% in one month Bitcoin prices have been on a roll, jumping 70% in one month, but no one is sure why.   "MMM is a community of people providing each other financial help on the principle of gratuitousness, reciprocity and benevolence," the firm says of itself, adding that bitcoin underpins its transactions.    "There are no rules. In principle! The only rule is no rules. At all! Even if you follow all of the instructions, you still may \'lose.\' \'Win\' might not be paid. Without any reasons or explanations," MMM incredibly writes in its "Warning!" section.    Quartz wrote an in-depth look at MMM and its founder\'s criminal history in 2013.    The Financial Times\' Alphaville blog wrote Wednesday that MMM\'s increasing popularity in China is behind the digital currency\'s sharp rise (which, as CNBC noted earlier this week, is on the back of high Chinese exchange volumes).    MMM did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.   Read More Bitcoin spikes 70% in a month; nobody knows why  One theory behind blaming MMM for the price jump is that its increasing popularity requires it to demand more bitcoins for transactions, which is boosting exchange rates in the relatively illiquid market.    Ark Invest analyst Chris Burniske, whose firm is bullish on bitcoin\'s future and maintains exposure to it through two ETFs, said he is monitoring the MMM situation and is investigating whether it may be the cause of a spike in unique bitcoin addresses being used in transactions.

Others say that the spike in Chinese bitcoin interest is a way to get around capital controls, but exchanges in that country have denied this claim.

In fact, Kelly suggested in a Tuesday note that Beijing\'s tightening of capital controls may have spurred some of the recent price gains.

Bitcoin industry insiders have issued an optimistic prediction for the cryptocurrency over the next few decades, suggesting it could be as widely used as the Swiss franc or the Australian dollar. U.K.-based Magister Advisors, which advises the technology industry on mergers and acquisitions, interviewed thirty of the leading bitcoin companies from across the globe. It found a consensus view that bitcoin will become the sixth largest global reserve currency within 15 years.   A reserve currency is a currency that is held in large amounts by governments and institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves, with the U.S. dollar currently being the most popular.         Bitcoin is a virtual currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. It was trading at $374 on Tuesday morning, just off its year-to-date high, according to industry website CoinDesk. However, many observers believe the real value of the cryptocurrency lies in the technology behind the coin known as the blockchain, a public and transparent ledger of all bitcoin transactions.    The survey found that an estimated $1 billion will be spent by the top 100 financial institutions on blockchain-related projects over the next 24 months. Jeremy Millar, partner at Magister Advisors who led the research, said that the blockchain was the most significant advancement in enterprise IT in the last decade.    "We have now reached a fork in the road with bitcoin and blockchain. Bitcoin has proven itself as an established currency. Blockchain, more fundamentally, will become the default global standard distributed ledger for financial transactions," he predicted in an accompanying press release on Tuesday morning.    In September, 13 of the world\'s leading banks joined a project to explore the possibilities behind using a type of distributed ledger in the mainstream financial world. Institutions like Bank of America, Citi and Deutsche Bank joined others like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan which had already signed up.    For many, it\'s the ledger that shows the real promise while the cryptocurrency itself is seen by some as having more of a shelf life. Aside from financials, the public ledger has a host of other useful applications. Pantera Capital in the U.S. is investing in a firm that is using the technology to help detect counterfeiting in the luxury goods industry. Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, told CNBC via email Tuesday that he suspects the interesting part to the bitcoin story will be the underlying technology and whether it facilitates the introduction of truly digital currencies.  Winklevoss twins cheer on Gemini bitcoin exchange The bitcoin exchange Gemini launched by the Winklevoss twins is seeing a surge in trading volumes, according to bitcoinity.org.   Bitcoin is also renowned for its volatility and has been heavily criticized for facilitating illegal activity, given that it can be used anonymously.     Jeffrey Robinson, the author of "BitCon: The Naked Truth about Bitcoin" is one such notable critic. He has told CNBC previously that he believes it is a "pretend currency masquerading as a pretend commodity" and says bitcoin advocates are akin to "snake oil salesmen."    The report by Magister Advisors on Tuesday directly tackled this issue of volatility. It said that the primary usage of bitcoin today in developed markets was for speculation. The survey\'s respondents estimated that 90 percent of bitcoin by value is being held for speculation, not for commercial transactions.

Virtual currencies can be exchanged tax-free in the European Union, following a ruling from the highest court in Europe on Thursday. Bitcoin and its alternatives can now be treated in the same way as traditional money, according to the European Court of Justice. It said in a statement Thursday morning that bitcoin transactions "are exempt from VAT (value-added tax) under the provision concerning transactions relating to currency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender." Bitcoin officially becomes a commodity Bitcoin will now be classified as a commodity in the U.S. according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).   The ruling comes after a dispute in a Swedish court when David Hedqvist, a Swedish national, applied for permission to operate his online bitcoin exchange. The Swedish Revenue Law Commission initially told Hedqvist that bitcoin was exempt from VAT but the Swedish Tax Authority appealed against that decision.    Bitcoin is a virtual currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.    The ruling paves the way for potentially cheaper transactions within the EU and therefore a boon for the nascent industry. Jonathan Rogers, partner in the financial services regulatory group at international law firm Taylor Wessing sees it as an opportunity for emerging forms of financial services.  "(The ruling is) a shot in the arm \u2013 bringing growth and consolidation.," he told CNBC via email. "Greater clarity can now emerge in the debate about how to regulate virtual currencies, leading to increased credibility and consumer confidence; in turn, virtual currencies will have a much greater critical mass in the financial services system." The price of bitcoin saw a slight increase after the news, rising around 3 percent, close to $8, during Thursdays\' session. Bitcoin: A viable alternative for Greeks?

Depends on where you live. Cloud computing and artificial intelligence will continue to be hot for Chinese consumers, but 3-D printing will be all the rage in Europe, technology executives say.     From bitcoin to the "Internet of Things," trend watchers are faced with a dizzying array of "disruptive" consumer technologies. The most indispensable consumer trend over the next three years, it turns out, depends on your region, according to a new study by audit, tax and advisory firm KPMG, who surveyed top executives at technology firms in 17 countries in August and September on topics like cybersecurity, data and analytics and biometrics.     Fifteen percent of those surveyed thought health-care technology would be the most disruptive consumer technology in the United States over the next three years, while in Europe, 3-D printing topped the chart at 12 percent. Cloud computing and artificial intelligence each gained 15 percent of votes for the most disruptive technology in China, according to the 832 business leaders surveyed from start-ups, mid-size to large enterprises, venture capital firms and angel investors.   "On the consumer side, the largest response from the U.S. sector was biotech, and health-care IT," said Gary Matuszak, global chair of KPMG\'s technology, media and telecommunications consulting practice. "I think that is indicative of the massive amount of transformation in the health-care industry here, and opportunities with wearables and digitizing health records. If you look at China and Japan, the result that comes out is artificial intelligence, where there has been a lot of push to make it a national priority, including some push for government spending and support to make China a world leader in AI."     The survey highlighted stark differences between societal and economic trends in different regions, Matuszak said, where some countries already see mobile and cloud as intuitive platforms for other technologies, while others are still trying to adjust.     Case in point: Only 2 percent of respondents saw artificial intelligence as a growing trend in Europe and the Middle East, compared to 15 percent in China and 10 percent in Japan. And while 11 percent saw mobile technology as a disruptive force in Europe, only 3 percent said the same for China.     "With societal trends, if you look at mobile in China, it has been way ahead of the U.S. and other places," Matuszak said. "Mobile is not seen as disruptive. So now, ["Internet of Things"] is much higher in China. It\'s, \'How do we take and use cloud and mobile applications that people are already accustomed to using, and apply them to different aspects like IOT?\' But some of the demographic changes will come through in how technology providers view opportunities in their regions."    For example, as the workforce ages in Japan, firms there are looking to artificial intelligence to make manufacturing more efficient, Matuszak said.     While other trendy technologies, like robots and digital currency, did not fare as well in any one region, KPMG did notice trends by industry. While only 2 percent of respondents saw Bitcoin as the most disruptive with American consumers, 41 percent saw it as potentially very disruptive to American banks.        "Asia has always led the transformation around mobile banking, because it was more of a necessity than a convenience there," Matuszak said. "As the number of cross-border transactions increase, there becomes more and more need for a global currency. U.S. financial institutions are really beginning to understand that they need to get ahead of this area and work with their counterparts around the world, and become a disruptor instead of the disrupted."     Global trends are important to keep in mind, Matuszak said, because though areas like New York City and Silicon Valley are still among top innovation hubs, Tokyo, Shaghai and London are quickly gaining ground.   "You\'re seeing countries\' recognizing that for them to continue to be relevant, they have to have innovation at the top of their list of priorities," Matuszak said.

Bitcoin is a virtual currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. However, many see the real worth of the cryptocurrency being the technology behind the coin. Called the blockchain -- this is a public and transparent ledger of all bitcoin transactions. On Tuesday, 13 of the world\'s leading banks joined a project to explore the possibilities behind using this type of distributed ledger in the mainstream financial world. Institutions like Bank of America, Citi and Deutsche Bank have joined others like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan which had already signed up. Bitcoin officially becomes a commodity Bitcoin will now be classified as a commodity in the U.S. according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).   R3 is the New York-based innovations firm behind the program and aims to establish a set of standards for a blockchain that banks can use. Together with R3, the banks will research and experiment with shared ledger solutions to meet banking requirements for security, reliability, performance, scalability, and audit.     Niall Cameron, head of EMEA markets at HSBC called it an "exciting partnership" in a press release Tuesday and said that the bank was "pleased to be involved." Satoshi Murabayashi, a CIO at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said that clients deserved a banking experience that comes with "enhanced security, low costs and minimal errors."    It might still be early days but the technology could effectively allow payments to be made instantly without a centralized authority and it would also be transparent with each bank being allowed access to the ledger.    Bitcoin: A viable alternative for Greeks?  Simon Dixon, fund manager and founder of Bitcoin Capital, discusses alternative finance options for Greece. One way the blockchain initiative could help the financial industry is in the several new developments in the derivatives industry relating to how financial markets operate. Regulation has tried to radically change the risks associated with financial derivatives trading - which has been blamed -- rightly or wrongly -- seen as accentuating the crash.    Clearing houses, also known as central clearing counterparties (CCP), have been seen as the answer by policymakers. However, Robert Sams, the CEO of Clearmatics, believes the distributed ledger could be a real solution for the industry.    "The CCPs are now the largest counterpart to most of the players in the derivatives market and are \'too big to fail\'," Sams told CNBC via email.    "Collateralization and resolution procedures are supposed to mitigate the risk of an event leading to public rescue, but these assumption-laden procedures are fragile and might be blown to bits upon first contact with market reality in times of stress. We should be decentralizing counterparty risk, not centralizing it."    Sams, and his London-based firm Clearmatics, have been tasked with innovating with derivatives trading with a form of the public ledger similar to bitcoin\'s. UBS is one big bank that has already shown an interest and reports state that many more are keeping a keen eye on the project.  Aside from financials, this public ledger has a host of other practicalities. Pantera Capital, an investment fund founded by Dan Morehead, are investing in a firm that using the technology to help detect counterfeiting in the luxury goods industry.   Morehead, however, is cool on the idea of it being used by banks.

While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.    As well as bitcoin exchanges and wallet services, a small but growing sector of derivatives firms selling products based on the digital currency have also sprung up in recent years.

The platform pitches itself as a broker which specializes in bitcoin derivatives, and trades financial products like options and futures which are directly linked to the price of the cryptocurrency. Thus, it allows users to "go long" and bet that the price of bitcoin will rise, or "go short" and bet the price will fall.    Technology enthusiasts, regulators and economists have been pondering how to pigeon hole bitcoin since its emergence in 2009.

But the digital token some say could replace government-backed currencies is facing a crisis that experts warn could potentially render it worthless.    Over the weekend, two well-known bitcoin developers "forked" the technology, releasing software that will allow the community to split away from the core program. This contentious split arose over a long-running squabble between developers that started as a disagreement about the way data is packaged, and morphed into a philosophical question about the future of the technology.    That very future\u2014as CNBC predicted in July\u2014could conceivably be threatened by the new software\u2014called Bitcoin XT.   "Contentious hard forks are bad for Bitcoin," the semi-official site Bitcoin.org\'s David Harding wrote in a policy post. A "hard" fork such as XT is not backwards-compatible with other versions of the software, meaning that any divergence in adoption is more difficult to reconcile. "At the very best, a contentious hard fork will leave people who chose the losing side of the fork feeling disenfranchised. At the very worst, it will make bitcoins permanently lose their value. In between are many possible outcomes, but none of them are good," the post continued.   Here\'s the gist of the squabble: Bitcoin transactions are packaged into blocks before being recorded on bitcoin\'s permanent ledger. Developers disagree over what the maximum size of those blocks should be. On one hand, smaller means more security, but on the other hand bigger means that bitcoin technology can more easily scale into wider adoption and noncurrency applications.    And beyond just the technical matter, the fight comes down to a more human dilemma: Who gets to decide which way the whole community, which is effectively leaderless, has to go?  Mike Hearn, one of the developers behind XT, wrote in a lengthy post explaining the fork that the current limitations of the original software are blocking the growth of bitcoin and its blockchain currency. He disputed Bitcoin.org\'s assessment of worst-case scenarios, and said that the fork may be the best way to save the currency from becoming irrelevant.  Read MoreThe details of the debate can be found here.    "There\'s no reason to believe a hard fork would make bitcoins permanently lose their value. On the contrary, it should increase them, as it\'d prove the system is robust against poor decisions by any one group of developers," Hearn said in an email to CNBC. "By asking Bitcoin users to believe that a contentious fork can destroy the system, all they\'re really saying is that the community must obey the wishes of a tiny group of developers regardless of whether those wishes are bad or not."    The way the XT fork works is that miners (who process transactions by solving complex math problems) can vote for whether they want to switch to the new system or stick with the core program. After Jan. 11, 2016, once 75 percent of mining power is voting for the fork, a two-week waiting period begins, and then the new rules take effect.    Several polls and projections have indicated that miners may favor the primary XT change\u2014making the maximum size for a "block" of data eight megabytes instead of one megabyte\u2014so a fork could be in the future.  Meet the blockchain The technology behind bitcoin could be even more important than the cryptocurrency itself.   Still, several core developers of the technology\u2014who have taken over maintenance and growth of the technology from mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u2014have come out against the change, and online discussions seem to indicate an ideological split in the community.    Those core developers against the block size increase either did not respond to request for comment from CNBC or denied via a representative.    But Adam Back, who developed one of the key algorithms behind bitcoin and still works with core developers, said the complaints about XT are manyfold, including worries that a 75 percent activation vote is too low, and that some of the other changes to the program are not sufficiently secure.    Back said the community is actively working on finding solutions (with developer workshops scheduled) to the block size problem, and that jumping ahead of the normal review system is "a little puzzling" and "kind of disappointing."    One major expert in the community wrote in a Reddit post that XT "represents a somewhat reckless approach, which in the name of advancement shatters existing structures, fragments the community and spins the ecosystem into chaos."   Read MoreBitcoin firm raises $116M, including Qualcomm investment    Hearn, however, told CNBC he thinks that assessment is "completely wrong," and that the XT approach has been debated for month with every objection considered. After all, the development of the potentially world-changing Bitcoin technology has been largely developed without much structure, he said.   "You can\'t shatter something that doesn\'t exist. Unfortunately a whole lot of people in the bitcoin community who aren\'t [closely] involved haven\'t fully realized or accepted how ad-hoc the Bitcoin Core project truly is," Hearn said, adding that "underlying contradictions and inability to make decisions" are actually the major problems that XT seeks to address.    Hearn\'s desire to alter the decision-making process behind bitcoin would see him and XT co-developer Gavin Andresen jointly managing the technology, rather than a group of developers. Back acknowledged that the emergence of XT partially stems from resentment about other developers\' ideas being shot down, but he said he believed a distributed power structure works best.    "It\'s intentionally a decentralized process. People are worried that with $4 billion on the line someone could be blackmailed or could intentionally insert a bug," Back said. "They didn\'t think about the risks of being the sole maintainer of $4 billion of other people\'s money.... They\'re not thinking ahead far enough about the implications for all of this." (The total value of all existing Bitcoins was about $4 billion at the beginning of August; it\'s closer to $3.4 billion now.)   As for concerns that his actions could spin the multibillion-dollar ecosystem into chaos, Hearn said he is in fact saving the technology.    "[Andresen] and myself have said since the start that Bitcoin is a risky experiment. I\'m sure everyone who invested knew that," Hearn wrote. "But if they invested, they presumably invested in the hope that Bitcoin would take off and become really mainstream. Right now, the only way to get there is via Bitcoin XT. So they should consider helping us out to ensure the outcome they would like."    Investor Roger Ver\u2014so-called "Bitcoin Jesus"\u2014is one of several prominent voices in the community to voice his approval of the XT project.      Additionally, a statement from all of the Chinese mining pools\u2014which account for much of the power in the network\u2014came out in favor of a block size increase. Still, Hearn could not say how he thought the community would swing, but underscored his contention that a vote for the core software could stymie future growth.    "Well, Bitcoin will still exist no matter what happens. But obviously if there\'s no chance of growth and the community decides to follow the Bitcoin Core developers (without even knowing who exactly is in that group), then a whole lot of other developers and entrepreneurs will leave," Hearn said. "Because you can\'t build a successful business on an infrastructure with no chances of growth."  Bitcoin: A viable alternative for Greeks?  Simon Dixon, fund manager and founder of Bitcoin Capital, discusses alternative finance options for Greece.   All of this occurs against a background of increasing corporate and financial interest in bitcoin and its backing blockchain technology.    Bitcoin runs on a blockchain that is more secure and decentralized than any of its competitors because of its large user base and its comparatively lengthy history. If those users were to splinter, then the entire enterprise could be compromised.   Read MoreWhy is it called the \'blockchain?\'    Hearn wrote in his explanation of the fork that there are few risks of breaking the community: If less than 75 percent votes for XT, then nothing changes, and if more than 75 percent is in favor, then the rest of the marketplace will follow suit so as not to be left behind.   "We don\'t think the sky will fall if the chain forks. We think people on the small-blocks side of the chain will upgrade and continue on the bigger-blocks side. There will be plenty of time for them to know about the change and prepare," he wrote.    Still, if a sizable minority decides to hold out against XT and its bigger blocks, then presplit bitcoins could be spent twice\u2014violating one of the key facets of the digital currency, and potentially harming trust.    Back warned that the results of the fork could be disastrous. Anti-XT programs have sprung up to corrupt the vote, so even if it appears that there\'s been a 75 percent majority, the community could still be split 50-50.    "If you get some kind of 50-50 split," Back explained, "you have two ledgers, not accepting each other\'s blocks ... inconsistent ledgers and exchanges that were out hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars."    "Nobody wants it to go there, but the Bitcoin XT thing is teetering into a dangerous situation and dynamic," he added. "The safest thing to do is to stop that dynamic well before activation."    Jeff Garzik, another bitcoin core developer who has expressed support for bigger blocks, told CNBC in June that creating a contentious fork would be the "worst of all possible options."    As Hearn said in his letter to the community: "So this is it. Here we are."

BTCGreece, which bills itself as the country\'s first bitcoin exchange, plans to eventually install 1,000 ATMs nationwide, in partnership with European bitcoin platform, Cubits.   Thanos Marinos, the founder of BTCGreece, told CNBC on Wednesday that a soft launch was on the cards for October.     "It is part of my vision to create a block chain ecosystem in Greece," he told CNBC. "If all goes as expected with no major issues we will launch first ATMs October 2015."    Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be used around the world. Transactions are listed in a shared public ledger called the block chain.      The digital currency has been touted as one way to to circumvent Greek capital controls. These have been in place since June and limit domestic investors to withdrawing no more than 60 euros ($66) per day from Greek banks, making life extremely tough for companies that need to pay or receive bills. Greek individuals and businesses are also forbidden from moving money to bank accounts abroad.   The ATMs envisaged by Marinos could allow users to convert fiat currency into bitcoin and potentially vice versa.    As yet, BTCGreece has no ATMs in Greece. However, Marinos said he had already received requests from 300 shops for bitcoin ATMs.      "We want to do it cautiously," he told CNBC, adding that BTCGreece would announce more partnerships next week.    Bitcoin rallied in June amid reports that Greeks were flocking to the currency in order to circumvent the controls. However, the currency\'s decentralized nature makes it challenging to say how many Greeks currently use it.   Bitcoin ATMs have already been installed in other countries, predominately in the U.S. and Western European countries like the U.K., the Netherlands and Spain.     "There has been a focus on bitcoin and Greece and the economic instability there," Akif Khan, chief commercial officer at digital commerce company, Bitnet, told CNBC on Wednesday.    "So in one sense it will be an interesting experiment to see if Greeks do gravitate towards bitcoin as one of the tools in their financial toolkit to try and cope."  Read MoreTrack Bitcoin versus the euro   Belfast-based Khan added that Greece\'s regulatory environment was conducive to introducing ATMs.     "In principle, putting bitcoin ATMs into Greece is just as feasible as in any other European country\u2026 Greece does not have a prohibitive regulatory environment in this regard," he told CNBC.   \u2014By CNBC\'s Katy Barnato.

Silicon Valley\'s elite might live in exclusive Bay-Area communities such as Atherton, Woodside and Palo Alto, but when they\'re looking to buy a second home, many turn to Martis Camp.  This is a private community located near the north shore of Lake Tahoe, which counts among its members heavy hitters from Apple, Google and Facebook as well as venture capitalists and start-up founders. "We\'re really catering to the people that are changing the world, and we\'re helping change their lives," sales director Brian Hull said. "They\'re coming here, and really unplugging a bit. And I think, consequently, they\'re conjuring up interesting ideas while they\'re away from their everyday lives." The 2,100-acre resort boasts an 18-hole golf course, 26 miles of trails for hiking, a private ski lift to nearby Northstar and of course access to Lake Tahoe itself.   The most unusual amenity might be the so-called "family barn." It\'s an 18,000-square-foot clubhouse that features basketball courts, a 44-seat movie theater, bowling lanes and spa. There\'s also an amphitheater where the Beach Boys kicked off the summer with a special private concert.     Business is booming. Last year, the club sold 138 properties for a total of $255 million.

And what may to outsiders seem like petty squabbling about a single number actually has major financial implications and could even threaten the very survival of the cryptocurrency.    The argument\u2014which is pitting Chinese constituencies against largely Western developers, the business community against the often ideological early adopters, and programmer against programmer\u2014centers on a simple number in the global bitcoin system. But if the various parties can\'t come to an agreement, the whole network could splinter, wrecking its major selling points of security and decentralization.    "There is literally a war going on right now in the bitcoin world," Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, told CNBC last month.    There are two major questions facing the technology: Who is bitcoin for? And who gets to decide?    Most of the early adopters saw appeal in bitcoin as a decentralized digital currency\u2014(to over-simplify the promise) a sort of virtual gold that could not be touched by governments, banks or corporations. But in seeking to create the perfect system for such a currency, bitcoin\'s early creators also created a technology that has wide-ranging applications.    That technology is called the "blockchain" (CNBC has gone in depth into how it works), and this is basically what it does: It can record any information in a secure way, and make that information both public and unchangeable\u2014doing this without relying on any central authority. Banks, stock exchanges, payment companies and others have already begun exploring how this can be used in their own businesses. Meet the blockchain The technology behind bitcoin could be even more important than the cryptocurrency itself.   The issue at hand is about the structure of bitcoin\'s blockchain (which is composed of "blocks" of data with each block referring back to the preceding chunk of information\u2014thereby creating a chain). The community is arguing about how big the maximum block size should be: The current max is one megabyte, which only allows for about seven transactions per second\u2014far too few for most businesses currently investing in the technology.    This speed is a "roadblock to bitcoin growth," Jeff Garzik, one of five bitcoin core developers who have taken over maintenance of the technology, wrote in a recent paper. (Visa, for comparison, says its network can handle more than 24,000 transactions per second.)   Read MoreWhy is it called the \'blockchain?\'    "Any responsible business projecting capacity usage into the future sees the system reaching an absolute maximum capacity, with this speed limit in place," he wrote. "Increasing or removing this limit will encourage businesses to view bitcoin as scalable and capable of supporting millions of new users."    The block size limit may also negatively impact bitcoin\'s original currency use-case: As the number of transaction requests exceed the limit, the user experience degrades: The pools of "miners" who help inscribe data onto the global network will begin charging ever-higher fees for processing, eliminating some of the appeal over other payment methods.    But there are reasons for limiting the size of a block. For one, it provides security for the system by constraining available space, and therefore making it costly to maliciously flood the network with spam.   Miners are generally against increasing the size too much: They would have to do more work on each block, but they\'d still reap the same benefit per block (while transaction fees remain negligibly low), said Pete Rizzo, the U.S. editor for cryptocurrency site CoinDesk.    Also, some early adopters who plan to hold bitcoin for extended periods of time as an investment may prefer to keep the block size limit low\u2014unbothered by transaction fees or business prospects, Garzik explained to CNBC.  Some skeptical of bitcoin hitting Wall Street Discussing whether bitcoin is a viable currency as NYSE launches bitcoin index with Win Thin, Brown Brothers Harriman, and Matt Roszak, Tally Capital. \n   But even if more interests seem to point to increasing the block size, there\'s no agreement what size is ideal\u2014balancing present-day security and future promise\u2014or how a change should be made.    Gavin Andresen, one of the most important developers of the technology, proposed increasing the max size to 20 megabytes. (He did not respond to request for comment.)   A powerful constituency of Chinese miners\u2014who also object to increasing the size of the block, saying their nation\'s Internet connection to the rest of the world would not allow it\u2014made a counter proposal suggesting an eight-megabyte maximum. Andresen has since backed a version of this plan.   Read MoreWhy financial firms are investigating bitcoin tech    For his part, Garzik proposed a sliding cap with a change to the bitcoin code allowing for periodic block increases (or even decreases) based on global miners\' votes.    Different sources told CNBC that the most important parts of the community were variously leaning toward Garzik\'s proposal, an 8-megabyte increase, or just a small "can-kicking" measure to wait for technologies that might allow them to bypass the question.    But as a totally decentralized system, bitcoin has no clear way to weigh these disparate opinions and interests\u2014in other words, no way to make a definitive decision.  Garzik called the block size debate the first major alteration to bitcoin policy since it began in January 2009. When other changes have been made, the core software has been changed, and the players on the network have quickly updated (anyone who doesn\'t follow the current protocol gets booted from the network until they comply).   But with a contentious issue like this, the developers risk splitting the network into those who want to follow one set of rules, and those who want another. If someone were to push out a global update without ensuring near-total consensus, a split could occur.  Read MoreBitcoin firm raises $116M, including Qualcomm investment    "That would be the worst of all possible options," Garzik said.    Bitcoin runs on a blockchain that is more secure and decentralized than any of its competitors because of its large user base and its comparatively lengthy history. If those users were to splinter, then the entire enterprise could be compromised.    So what\'s at stake? Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in bitcoin and blockchain-related companies, and the current value of all the bitcoin in existence is currently about $4 billion.    The risks of a network split are low but not negligible, experts told CNBC.    "You\'re dealing with consensus among a community of people who aren\'t communicating very well\u2014and haven\'t for some time," Rizzo said, explaining that making any change to the code risks breaking a technology that already works pretty well.    "At what point does that risk become untenable? At this point it\'s still within the realm of \'danger Will Robinson\'-level risk," he added.', 'publisher': 'CNBC', 'author': {'twitterurl': u'http://twitter.com/Ev_Rosenfeld', 'name': u'Everett Rosenfeld', 'twitterhandle': u'Ev_Rosenfeld'}, 'url': 'http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/23/bitcoins-war-could-threaten-its-survival.html', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 7, 23, 14, 46, 19, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -14400)), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Bitcoin's 'war' could threaten its survival"}, {'articleText': u'   The political crisis in Greece makes a government solution unlikely, so I have helped create a private solution. I think Greece could use blockchain technology to create an asset-backed digital currency that would act as a complement to the current currency regime. A parallel currency can kick-start the Greek economy and avert a humanitarian disaster.   Read MoreKelly: A bitcoin-like solution for Greece    The Greek people were correct to vote "no" on the referendum on debt-repayment terms. Austerity has pushed Greece into a depression \u2013 more austerity will exacerbate the situation.  The solution to the Greek problem is writing off a portion or all of the debt. While this had been a non-starter for the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Union, just last week the IMF conceded that Greece\'s debt load was unsustainable. So now what?    Over the next several weeks the ECB, IMF and EU will renegotiate with Greece, but unless they acquiesce to a debt haircut (being repaid less than they loaned), the talks will be futile. In the meantime, it is the Greek people who will suffer. Without a banking system and access to cash, citizens have found themselves short of essential items like prescription drugs.  The larger problem is that faith in the banking system has been shattered. Much like during the Great Depression in the U.S., generations of Greeks will not trust keeping funds in banks.  During America\'s Great Depression the only choice for frightened citizens was to hide cash under the mattress \u2014 today, we can use the technology behind bitcoin to create a store of value that is independent of the traditional banking system.     The digital currency I created last year, Nautiluscoin, was designed to tackle this specific task.  Blockchain technology has progressed rapidly over the last 12 months and we can now offer Greece a digital currency that is backed by gold and is integrated into a mobile-banking platform.   The mayor of the Greek island of Agistri has agreed to allow the island to be a pilot program for a new monetary ecosystem, which will use Nautiluscoin. Agistri is a small island in the Saronic Gulf that is ideally located 55 minutes from Piraeus, the largest port in Greece.  The combination of the small size and convenient location makes Agistri a perfect candidate for a pilot program. Over the coming weeks, the infrastructure for this project will be rolled out and the citizens of Agistri will receive Nautiluscoin to begin transacting. Read MoreOp-ed: The real loser? Germany, not Greece  Nautiluscoin was originally designed as stable store of value with a "stability fund" that would act as an internal central bank to reduce the notorious volatility associated with digital currencies like bitcoin. After some trial and error, I have discovered what many others have over the last 5,000 years \u2013 the most trusted independent form of money is gold.  In order to create a stable store of value backed by gold, we will employ a two-pronged approach for Nautiluscoin. First, the Nautiluscoin Stability Fund will initially retain a majority ownership stake in Nautiluscoin. As the monetary ecosystem grows, these coins will be sold to meet demand. The goal of this program will be to provide a countercyclical monetary policy that will foster an environment that allows for steady growth in purchasing power.    Using blockchain technology makes it easy to create a currency, but that currency is useless without a banking system. Currently the Greek banking system is effectively shut and it is unclear when or if it will re-open. We are partnering with Coinstructors  (a UK digital currency and mobile banking company) who created Drachmae.Money.   Drachmae.Money will charge a fee for each Nautiluscoin transaction. Instead of the fee going to a for-profit entity the revenue generated will be recycled to support the purchasing power of Nautiluscoin.  The fees generated will be used by the Nautiluscoin Stability Fund to purchase gold \u2013 in this way, as the monetary ecosystem grows the amount of gold backing Nautiluscoin will also grow. Our goal by recycling the fees is to grow the amount of gold backing Nautiluscoin.   Using gold to back Nautiluscoin should give both tourists and merchants assurance that a digital currency is more than just lines of computer code, while utilizing the stability fund to create a countercyclical monetary policy will provide flexibility that gold lacks. Since it is unclear what fiat currency Greece will eventually choose (euro or new drachma), a digital currency like Nautiluscoin can be quickly be deployed to kick-start the tourism industry. We have already begun to implement this plan and estimate that it will take 60 to 90 days to fully execute.  Read MoreOp-ed: Are Greece and China repeating history?    Using Drachmae.Money, tourists will be able to acquire Nautiluscoin in a manner that is fully Know-Your-Customer (KYC) compliant via their mobile phone. Once tourists arrive on the island of Agistri, merchants will be able to accept payment in Nautiluscoin.    Inspired by the WIR Bank in Switzerland, Coinstructors has also created Drachmae.Connect \u2013 a business-to-business platform that will not only allow merchants to exchange services, but also enable tourists to book vacations at a discount. This solution draws inspiration from the highly successful WIR Bank that manages and issues the private currency WIR franc in Switzerland. The WIR Bank was established by two Swiss businessmen in 1934 in response to a failing economy and currency shortages.    Read MoreOp-ed: Why Greece voted \'no\'    While many people think that the Swiss franc is the only currency in Switzerland, the WIR franc has been accepted as payment since 1934. This complementary currency has an 80-year plus history of fueling a business-to-business network.  Allowing the use of Nautiluscoin will immediately infuse capital into the island of Agistri, while the tools of the Drachmae Project will allow tourists and businesses to connect and transact independent of the Greek banking system. The asset backing of Nautiluscoin will give confidence to holders that Nautiluscoin is an independent store of value.  Read MoreOp-ed: Greece\'s pride problem  The Nautiluscoin/Drachmae.Money solution is designed to act as a complement to the existing monetary ecosystem. It is a private solution to a public problem.  This is not a vanity project or publicity stunt \u2013 I have already and will continue to invest my own money to complete this project \u2013 this goes beyond a profit and loss statement. I view this as investing in a new frontier.   Blockchain technology allows for the efficient creation of a complementary currency, while mobile banking provides an ideal independent ecosystem.

European leaders have given Greece until the weekend to reach an aid-for-reforms deal with its creditors or risk bankruptcy and banking collapse. Here, we outline the currency options available to Greece if it leaves the single currency.    Greece could unilaterally "adopt" the euro, even if it left the euro zone. This option would see it join countries like Monaco, Andorra, San Marino and Vatican City which all use the euro as their national currency, despite not being euro zone member states.    The European Commission, the European Union\'s executive arm, allows these countries to issue limited amounts of euro coins, but they\'re not allowed to print their own banknotes. Only the European Central Bank (ECB) can authorise the issuing of issue euro banknotes.    Greece would likely be required to pay its debt to the ECB in order to qualify, and the central bank would need to be in a "mood" to carry on providing assistance to the country\'s banks, Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank, told CNBC.     If the ECB stops providing Greek banks with emergency funding, the central bank could begin printing another currency without giving up the euro to meet its commitments, such as welfare payments. The value of the new currency could likely fall rapidly against the euro, which could seriously impact Greeks\' spending power.     This inflation would give Greeks an incentive to carry on using the euro, Foley explained, entrenching a dual currency. It could effectively create a two-speed economy, with the euro dominating in sectors like tourism.   Read MoreWhy the drachma can\'t save Greece: Goldman   Roger Bootle, executive chairman of Capital Economics, told CNBC that a parallel currency\u2014rather than replacing the euro altogether\u2014would be a way for Greece to show Europe that it hadn\'t left the currency union. This could potentially make it easier to continue to receive financial aid.    "It\'s a fudge," Bootle said. "It\'s an awkward half-way house."     Another option is for the country to revert to its pre-2001 currency, the drachma, leaving the euro behind altogether.    "The key thing is that it has to redenominate deposits and debts into a new currency ... which is the easy thing to do," Bootle said. "The trickier thing to do is in terms of supplying notes\u2014initially there won\'t be any notes available."    To deal with what\'s bound to be a "messy situation," the government might issue IOUs in the interim. Stamps, for example, could be quickly printed in large volumes and used in place of bills, Bootle explained.    Adoption of any new currency\u2014whether or not it\'s called the drachma\u2014would result in further defaults, Foley said. Greece has already effectively defaulted on a 1.5-billion euro ($1.6 billion) payment to one of its biggest creditors, the International Monetary Fund.    A new currency would inevitably be weaker than the euro, increasing the weight of the country\'s euro-denominated debt.     "Greece needs to be able to issue their own currency and need[s] the devaluation that comes with running your own currency," Bootle said. It\'s unlikely to be an easy transition, but he insisted that this was the country\'s best option.     Many countries regulate their currencies by linking them to the euro. Adopting a pegged currency, however, requires either a stable economy able to ward off speculative attack, or significant currency reserves.    Bulgaria had enough reserves to introduce what\'s known as a currency board. This means it is committed to converting its currency\u2014the lev\u2014for euros on demand. However, Greece is unlikely to drum up enough currency stockpiles to use this option.   Denmark\'s currency, on the other hand, is pegged to the euro but its economy is considered strong enough to maintain the peg without needing to build up such currency stores.    Some have suggested that Greece could adopt a digital currency like bitcoin, avoiding the messy practicalities of a new currency or paper IOUs.     Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, said that while it\'s "very unlikely" that the Greek government would formally adopt bitcoin as an official currency, its use may increase significantly in the event of a Grexit.     "Greeks may understandably lack confidence in a new drachma and seek an alternative," he said.     But both Bootle and Foley were skeptical that an economy that relies so heavily on cash could function without physical bills.   Read MoreGrexit to drachma would be dangerous: Larry Summers   "It\'s more likely Greece would completely revert to cash, which is already happening, than digital currency," Foley said.     She said that although digital transactions still appeared to be working in Greece, "if you\'re a small producer, you\'re probably going to prefer to see the cash given the uncertainties."     Indeed, rather than look to digital currencies, Bootle said that people get creative in finding ways of dealing with a limited amount of bills.

Greece&rsquo;s currency options'}, {'articleText': u'   As bitcoin struggles to gain mass appeal, advocates of the digital currency are turning to a new audience to promote adoption: the global unbanked.    More than 2 billion adults lack access to financial services such as a bank accounts and credit cards to save and borrow funds, according to the World Bank, with the majority residing in rural areas and typically living below $5 a day.    "Bitcoin can be a paradigm shift for the unbanked," \u200eMichael Fraser, reporting leader at Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAAZ), told CNBC. "The effects are multifold: there will be change on a technological, political and economic level."    Bitcoin\'s biggest benefit to the group lies in its capacity as a money transfer and remittance tool, Fraser said. As smartphone ownership in developing nations explodes, bitcoin is a cheaper alternative to traditional transfer companies like Western Union.  "It has lower fees, just 1 percent compared to the standard 5 percent fee, plus it\'s instant unlike fixed processing times for traditional services," Fraser added.    Price volatility is a major reason why the cryptocurrency has yet to capture the mass market. A year ago, one bitcoin was equivalent to $665 but now trades at $267, according to Coindesk\'s price index. However, the threat of volatility becomes muted in money transfers.    "A number of the bitcoin-based remittance solutions on the market allow users to fix an exchange rate before a payment is made. With a pre-agreed rate, there is effectively no exchange rate volatility risk as the sender will know how much money the recipient will receive for a given sending amount before it is sent," said Zennon Kapron, managing director at KapronAsia and a longtime bitcoin watcher.   Read MoreBitcoin\'s tech is entering the major leagues    Moreover, bitcoin can also boost small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in emerging nations. "Many small businesses struggle to compete internationally due to the costs associated with accepting currencies and processing fees. Bitcoin essentially eliminates these concerns  by operating on a purely digital format," said a joint report by PwC and CAAZ.  Should Greeks bet on Bitcoin?  Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, is waving fees for the next week for customers buying and selling with euros. He joins Squawk Alley to discuss Bitcoin and opportunities it may have for payments.  To be sure, challenges are aplenty. The technology divide remains the biggest obstacle, warned Vishal Gupta, co-founder of the Bitcoin Alliance of India. "Most of the unbanked [in India] are uneducated and don\'t know how to read or write, and getting them to trust bitcoin will be an arduous task." He notes there are only about 15-20,000 present active users in the country\'s 1.2 billion population.   Poverty is typically cited as a key explanation behind unbanked populations, but other factors like wild currency swings are also at play. In Argentina for example, an artificial exchange rate mandated by the government is forcing people to eschew the peso, explained Franco Amati, co-founder of virtual currency hub Espacio Bitcoin.    "If you receive dollars in Argentina, the Central Bank give you less pesos (30 to 35 percent less) for each dollar than what the real market price is," Amati said via e-mail. "But if you buy bitcoins abroad and send them to someone in Argentina, the Argentinian will be able to sell them at a real exchange rate and get 100 percent of the money, excluding a small broker fee."    Storing bitcoins in the medium to long-term can be an attractive alternative to a volatile currency, agreed Fraser. Russia, another country suffering from a currency crisis, saw transaction volumes between the ruble and bitcoin increase nearly 250 percent in December as the former crumbled on the back of weaker oil prices.

So, why not in the case of Greece?   There is no reason for gold to get any love now because this is a political crisis, not a currency crisis. The primary reason you buy the "barbarous relic" that is gold is fear of a global currency crisis.    Read MoreGreece Crisis: Eurogroup denies bailout extension    In Greece, citizens and investors are not concerned about having a currency to use; the only unknown is which currency they will adopt or create. Currently, the Greek citizens have a currency, the euro, but using it is next to impossible with the banks closed.  Nonetheless, the restricted use of euros is far superior than gold. Just imagine walking into a Greek merchant with a bar of gold and trying to purchase something! Seriously, if you have some gold coins lying around for just such a bunker-busting moment \u2014 would a merchant accept those? If, by some miracle the merchant agreed to accept your gold coins, either you or the merchant would need a highly accurate scale to measure the gold flakes necessary just to buy something small like a pack of gum. If they didn\'t, you\'d have to hunt around for another merchant who accepted gold and sold scales\u2026    Gold is only useful in a complete currency collapse, as long as there is a viable alternative that is integrated with a banking system then gold will remain unloved. If you are worried that all currencies will be debased, you buy gold. This is not to say that gold cannot be used as a store of value \u2014 in fact, gold has a 5,000-year history of doing just that.  Gold is both useful and valuable \u2014 just not in a political crisis.  Read MoreGreece\'s creditors need a wake-up call   Finally, if this crisis does get out of control, it will lead to deflation and as a global price barometer, gold typically falls in a deflationary environment. Of course, if the central bank of the world\'s reserve currency, the Federal Reserve, determines that the crisis warrants another round of quantitative easing, then you definitely buy gold.   I have checked with every one of my contacts in the  bitcoin-exchange world and not one has seen an uptick in buying of bitcoin coming from Greece.     That is not to say that Greece is not the reason for the recent rise in bitcoin \u2014 it is. Speculators have been buying up bitcoin as a safe-haven alternative asset \u2014 more specifically an asset that trades 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is out of reach of government decrees on bank closures or bail-ins.     One exchange I spoke with reported a doubling of volume over the last few days \u2026 but all of the volume was from speculators outside of Greece. This makes intuitive sense \u2014 with the banks closed, it is near impossible to transfer money from your Greek bank account to an exchange to buy bitcoin.

I have written and opined that, to see the future of finance, we must look beyond the currency use case for bitcoin and block-chain technology. It is encouraging to see that this relatively small crisis has not only highlighted one of bitcoin\'s use cases and has caused the price to rise. Imagine what bitcoin would be worth when all the use cases are realized.     The Holy Grail of safe-haven assets would be a digital currency that is backed by gold, but this does not exist \u2026 yet.

Bitcoin traded at more than $255 on Monday afternoon, according to CoinDesk\'s Bitcoin Price Index\u2014up from about $223 on June 7. In fact, that\'s approaching the cryptocurrency\'s three-month high of about $261, and it\'s all thanks to Greece, according to traders and bitcoin experts.    "(Bitcoin) had been middling around the $235-245 range for several months, and all of the sudden this crisis escalates and you\'ve gotten yourself a nice 10-point pop," said Brendan O\'Connor, CEO of digital currency-specialists Genesis Global Trading, adding that Greece was likely the only factor behind the digital currency\'s upward momentum.   "I don\'t think it could be for any other reason," he said, explaining that his trading desk expects bitcoin to rise on macro events that are widely seen as potentially harmful to major global currencies. (The euro initially fell broadly on Sunday night following news of Greek capital controls, but it pared many of those losses on Monday.)    Despite several reports that Greeks are looking to bitcoin as they see the money supply getting tight in their country, most experts in the space say that the recent price increase is coming from speculation outside the country\u2014not a mad dash for digital cash inside its borders.

Funding for tech firms in the region almost doubled from $2.88 billion in 2014 to $5.65 billion so far this year, according to GP Bullhound, the technology-focused investment bank.    As part of London Technology Week, an awards ceremony -- The Europas -- identified some of Europe\'s hottest tech companies, with a panel of judges made up of venture capitalists and journalists deciding the victors.     Companies were nominated across 25 different categories, including best e-commerce start-up and best entertainment start-up.    Here are some of the winners.   Winner: Spotify   Despite being nine years old, music-streaming service Spotify won this award, as it continues to "change the music industry," according to the organizers of The Europas.    The Swedish start-up recently raised a $526 million round of funding giving it a valuation of over $8 billion. Spotify has 20 million paying subscribers, and 75 million members overall.    But Spotify has come under fire from those in the music industry and has been accused of paying low royalties to artists. Last year, pop star Taylor Swift pulled her whole music collection off the platform in protest.    Spotify is now competing in an extremely tough market with competition from the likes of Apple Music, Jay Z\'s Tidal service and Google.     Other nominees in the category included Shazam and Soundcloud.     Winner: Deliveroo    It seems that we cannot get enough of food delivery companies, and Deliveroo impressed the judges most.     The London-based start-up allows people to order food from restaurants like Ping Pong and Gourmet Burger Kitchen and have it delivered. Earlier this year, Deliveroo received a $25 million round of funding from Accel Partners.     Other nominees included another food service Delivery Hero and Hello Fresh.     Winner: Citymapper    Citymapper won three awards at The Europas including "best travel start-up" and the coveted "grand prix" prize.     It\'s an U.K.-based urban navigation app designed to help people get around some of the world\'s biggest cities.     Last year, Citymapper got a $10 million round of funding led by London-based Balderton Capital.     Other nominees in the category included YPLan and Wallapop.    Winner: Adyen    Adyen is Netherlands\' first "unicorn" and provides much of the back-end technology for online, mobile and in-store payment systems.    Last year, the Dutch company raised a $250 million round of funding led by General Atlantic, Temasek and Index Ventures.    Fintech has become an increasingly hot space, with companies looking to disrupt the businesses of major financial institutions.     Other nominees in the category included money transfer service TransferWise, and peer-to-peer lending platform Funding Circle.     Winner: Digital Shadows    Cybersecurity has been in the headlines over the past year following a number of high-profile attacks on companies.    Digital Shadows describes itself as a "cyber threat intelligence company" aimed at protecting businesses from dangerous hack attacks and data loss.    The London-based start-up recently bagged $8 million in funding.     Other nominees included email encryption company Whiteout Networks and security intelligence firm Cyberlytic.    Winner: Blockchain     Blockchain is the world\'s most popular bitcoin wallet provider, offering storage and enabling people to buy things with the cryptocurrency.   The company also provides information and data on the block chain \u2013 the public ledger of bitcoin transactions.    A number of investors have questioned the future of bitcoin, claiming that the underlying block chain technology will be more important in the future. Still, this has not stopped people talking about the digital currency.    Last year, Blockchain raised $30.5 million in funding, after rival Bitpay announced a $30-million funding round.     Other nominees in the category included bitcoin payment processing company Bitpay, and a bitcoin transaction start-up Safello.     Winner: Space Ape Games    So-called "casual gamers" are set to drive $30 billion of revenues to the mobile games markets this year, according to market research firm Newzoo, and start-ups are capitalizing on this.     Space Ape Games is a mobile gaming company behind popular title Samurai Seige.     The British start-up raised $7 million of funding at the end of last year led by Accel Partners.    Other nominees in the category included Moshi-Monster-maker Mind Candy and another mobile gamemaker, Omnidrone.     Winner: Hassle.com    Everything nowadays is on-demand and can be ordered from a smartphone. At The Europas, it was Hassle.com \u2013 a service that allows you to order a cleaner straight to your door \u2013 that took the prize in this category.    The sharing economy refers to the swathe of start-ups that allows users to rent things owned by others, such as Airbnb or BlaBlaCar.     Hassle.com raised around $6 million in a funding round last year.    Other nominees in the category included ridesharing app BlaBlaCar,   and parking space booking app JustPark.

As Greecestumbles toward capital controls, bitcoinis once again proving its disruptive power within the global financial system.  Over the past week, both the price and volume of bitcoin has been increasing (it\'s up 11 percent so far in June) - this is similar to the activity that occurred when Cyprusintroduced capital controls in 2013.  During the Cyprus crisis, citizens were not only locked out of their bank accounts but many found that some of their money was confiscated when the banks re-opened. This confiscation went by the "friendly" moniker "bail-in." In the Cyprus bail-in, any deposit above 100,000 euros were converted into Bank of Cyprus shares. Given this precedent, it is no surprise that Greeks are seeking a safe haven for their savings.    If Greece does choose to leave the euro zone, it is unclear what currency the government will choose \u2014 it could choose a new drachma or it could choose an existing currency like the Russian ruble. Regardless of the fiat currency the Greek government chooses, the likelihood that Greek citizens holding paper currency will lose money in a Grexit is very high. Its only natural for citizens to seek an easy and secure alternative.     Read MoreECB warns Greek banks may not open on Monday    Since 2013, the bitcoin ecosystem has matured and it is now easier than ever to purchase and securely store bitcoins. This makes bitcoin the ideal instrument for Greeks to use as a store of value.     What is most striking about the use of bitcoin as a safe-haven asset is that doing so completely disrupts the balance of power between the government, the financial system and its citizens. Part of the European negotiating strategy with Greece has been to make conditions so bad for ordinary citizens that they force politicians to concede to onerous adjustments.  So far, this tactic has failed to force Greece into a deal. I am skeptical of this tactic because Greek politicians have little to gain by accepting a deal with the European Union. Since the new government was voted in with the mandate to end austerity, it would be political suicide for them to accept a deal that continued down this path. It would also be economic suicide as further austerity measures will likely push Greece further into depression and result in an even higher debt-to-GDP ratio.    Read MoreA bitcoin-like solution for Greece    But there is also another reason this tactic may not work \u2014 it\'s called competition. The disruptive power of bitcoin has, for the first time in modern history, divorced the currency from the state. This disruption should not be dismissed \u2014 ordinary Greek citizens no longer have to wait and see what currency the government (either Greek or EU) will allow them to use \u2014 they are free to choose bitcoin or any other digital currency in existence. This competition among currencies is the beating heart of both capitalism and democracy and this competition removes a piece of the euro-zone leverage.    Recently there has been a marked increase in volume across multiple exchanges. If this is Greek citizens converting savings into bitcoin, it could mean citizens will become indifferent to political demands. Moreover, since bitcoin can be used to purchase goods and services at over 100,000 merchants, it\'s unclear whether citizens will ever choose to return to a government-backed fiat currency. The implications of this reality should not be underestimated. Competition among currencies is a new phenomenon ushered in by bitcoin and the blockchain. The ultimate result of competition is to erode the power of the dominant players. This is not to say that Greece will devolve into a lawless society; on the contrary, compassion among currencies places the power back into the hands of the citizens and this is the essence of democracy. It is not lost on me that the birthplace of democracy could also be the cradle of a new balance of power.

The price of bitcoin hit its highest level since early April this week, amid reports that concerned Greek investors were flocking to the digital currency. Bitcoin has enjoyed a solid week of gains, rising around 5 percent since Monday, according to industry website Coindesk. This came as Reuters, citing two bitcoin experts, reported that the rally was due to Greek depositors. The decentralized digital currency is seen as having the potential to circumvent any capital controls that may be imposed in Greece, as the country edges closer to an important repayment deadline amid fears that the country could default on its debt. Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, told CNBC that some Greeks did appear to be moving funds into bitcoin.  "(This is) in response to the possibility of capital controls, which would likely follow if Greece crashes out of the euro," he said. Some in the industry are even likening it to bitcoin\'s mega-rally of April 2013, which occurred when capital controls were imposed in Cyprus as part of its international bailout.  However, experts are divided over whether Cyprus was the real driver behind the price increases, and some suggested that increased media attention -- especially in China -- was the real reason behind the rise.  Hileman warned that as the Cypriot crisis abated, bitcoin\'s price plummeted \u2013 which could explain the more cautious move in bitcoin\'s price in response to the ongoing Greek developments. How to simplify bitcoin payments John Collins, head of government affairs at Coinbase, talks about how his platform is making bitcoin payments easier.   Not everyone is convinced by bitcoin\'s value, however, with venture capitalists telling CNBC that there is little worth in the digital currency beyond the technology that supports it.   The digital currency had passed the "peak of expectations," Rob Moffat, principal venture capitalist at Balderton Capital, said, adding that people had become more skeptical towards it.    "It\'s now down in the trough of disillusionment," Moffat told CNBC. "The fashionable thing for this year is that the blockchain is an interesting technology."    Former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters, now CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, told CNBC earlier this month that the blockchain -- a public and transparent ledger of all bitcoin transactions -- had the potential to empower the financial world.    It could be applied to financial payment companies, for instance, according to Michael Treskow from venture capital firm Accel Partners.    "It used to be that people thought that two years from now we were all going to paying with bitcoin and people were wondering what\'s going to happen with cash. Ultimately, what the focus is shifting to is the blockchain as an underlying technology," he told CNBC on Wednesday.    Meanwhile, research from the Bank of England has also stated that the technology could be applied in stock exchanges.   And the Bank of England isn\'t the only central bank with its eyes on bitcoin.  Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Central Bank of Russia, told CNBC this week that the bank was monitoring bitcoin developments.     "We are watching over the development of this market and see that for consumers there are certain attractions in bitcoin\'s mobility, expediency, low cost," she told CNBC.

A bitcoin start-up has launched a service that will allow people to carry out foreign exchange transactions for free, dodging the expensive commission often charged by major financial institutions.    Bitreserve, a company founded last year by CNET and salesforce.com co-founder Halsey Minor, allows people to convert bitcoin into normal currencies and precious metals. The start-up used to charge a 0.45 percent commission for bitcoin-to-dollar transactions, but has now cut its fees entirely.    The move is likely to give it an edge in the hotly contested "fintech" market where a number of companies such as U.K.-based Transferwise are contesting the currency transfer and mobile payments space.    Users of the platform will be able to make currency exchanges in eight major currencies: euros, dollars, pounds, yuan, yen, pesos, rupees, swiss francs. People will also have the ability to convert the currencies into gold, silver, platinum and palladium, depending on the market price. Bitreserve offers the mid-market rate for currencies.    "Those in society who can least afford it have to spend so much for things that are so commonplace," Anthony Watson, president and chief operating officer of Bitreserve, told CNBC by phone.    "If you look at a Mexican immigrants, they send approximately $30 billion home every year and they pay just under $3 billion for the privilege of sending that money home. That is 10 percent and that is disgusting."   Bitreserve\'s service comes with a catch however \u2013 you have to own bitcoin to use the service in order to make an initial deposit and then convert it to another asset. Plus, when users receive money, they can only spend it in bitcoin.    This could put it at a disadvantage to other companies that allow people to sign up with bank accounts and send money for still a small commission.    One use case of such a technology is remittances, which reached $436 billion in 2014, according to the World Bank. Since its inception in October 2014, Bitrserve has been responsible for $14.5 million worth of transactions globally, according to its website.     But not all experts agree that a free model is sustainable in the currency exchange business.    "No business that offers its services for free can do so sustainably over a long period of time without other revenue sources," Stan Stalnaker, board member of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority, a self-regulating body for digital currencies, told CNBC by email. Read MoreThis is why bitcoin won\'t go away anytime soon   "The real question, in an age of free transactions, is about business models - what other products and services can Bitreserve launch that it will charge for, and how successful will that be on the back of very low cost remittances?"    Watson said the company was looking to partner with traditional financial institutions to allow people to move the money into traditional bank accounts, as well as retailers so people can buy items using regular currencies.    "We are in conversation across the world with not only banks but different financial services providers. We are talking to a myriad of companies. We don\'t see ourselves as a threat to banks we see ourselves as complimenting what they do," Watson, the former Nike CIO, said.    Another use of Bitreserve\'s technology is to store bitcoin in a stable currency like the U.S. dollar.    "A lot of people are putting money on reserve and moving it into currency and moving bitcoin into a stable form of currency. Bticoin bounces around like a jack rabbit," Watson added.    A number of companies such as Coincove and ArtaBit are offering similar services, but only allowing people to send bitcoin to converted to one currency.

ShapeShift, a digital currency exchange that doesn\'t require users to make accounts, announced Thursday it is pulling its service from New York state because it does not wish to comply with the recently issued BitLicense. That new law asks digital currency firms to, among other things, record some personal identifying information of its users. ShapeShift opposes that effort.   "We either would have to do something we\'re not comfortable with or leave New York," ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees told CNBC. "It\'s a moral and ethical stand we\'re going take."    The BitLicense\u2014drafted by the office of Benjamin Lawsky, New York\'s outgoing superintendent of financial services\u2014seeks to provide consumer protection for digital currencies. But it also moves to institute provisions like "know your customer," which authorities say are important to prevent fraud, money laundering and funding for terrorism.   Read MoreNew York regulator issues final bitcoin rules    Voorhees, however, said these goals do not justify the risk of exposing customers to a potential data breach\u2014after all, he said, major companies and governments have proven unable to secure their data from hackers.    "We\'re not going to spy on thousands of people purely to make their job a little bit easier," Voorhees said of law enforcement, challenging the practice of opening up customers to potential identify theft simply to prevent drug money from "circling around."    The New York Department of Financial Services anticipated some responses like ShapeShift\'s, according to a spokesman for the department.    "We always recognized that there is going to be some part of this community that is against even pretty standard financial regulatory oversight measures, such as anti-money laundering controls and other consumer protections," he said in a statement to CNBC. "That said, one digital currency company has already received a license from NYDFS and a number of others have stated they intend to seek BitLicenses shortly."   Read MoreWhy financial firms are investigating bitcoin tech    "Ultimately, we believe that prudent regulation will be important to building greater consumer confidence in digital currency and sparking wider adoption," the spokesman added.    If authorities went through the proper channels to collect information from ShapeShift, Voorhees said, then he would be willing to provide wallet addresses, IP logs and information on what devices were used to access the platform\u2014but not names and addresses.    All attempts at using ShapeShift within New York will redirect to PleaseProtectConsumers.org, Voorhees said, adding that he expects to sacrifice about 1 percent of volume on the decision.   Others in the bitcoin world have also criticized the notion of applying "know your customer" regulations to digital currency.

A New York man was robbed at gunpoint of $1,100 worth of bitcoin, police told CNBC.com on Friday.  The case is strongly similar to at least one other robbery in the Big Apple involving the digital currency earlier this year.   The latest combination street-cyber crime occurred at around 11:30 a.m. on May 27 in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.    The 28-year-old victim told police he went to a street corner there to meet a man who had answered his Craigslist.com ad offering bitcoins for sale, police said.    The purported buyer then led the victim to a car to complete the purchase, where another man sitting in the backseat pulled a gun and ordered the victim to electronically transfer the bitcoins to the thieves, cops said.   Read MoreBitcoin needs more consumer protection    After the victim sent the bitcoins, the thugs then took the victim\'s cellphone, and drove off, according to police. The victim then called 911.   "It\'s still under investigation," said the police spokeswoman. She said there was no surveillance video footage of the virtual money stickup available.    In February, the New York Observer reported quoted a bitcoin dealer named Dean Katz, who described how he had been robbed at gunpoint by a man in Queens who had arranged to meet him to buy bitcoin so the man could gamble on the Super Bowl. Katz said he was forced to transfer $8,500 worth of bitcoin and also was robbed of $3,500 in cash.    New York police on Friday gave additional details about that Jan. 22 robbery of Katz. They said he entered a car containing two other men at about 1:50 a.m. that morning to complete the sale.    "He was held at gunpoint and the suspects requested his Samsung phone and money," police said. Katz then got out of the car, and the suspects fled, cops said.

The Observer article said that a New York City firefighter had been stabbed during a robbery of bitcoins that he had agreed to sell.

Or are you taking bets on a price plunge using complex derivatives?    Either way, I have a little tip for you.    There\'s another way to trade the controversial cryptocurrency and it involves new regulation from New York which was finalized last week.   The  U.S. state is ensuring that financial intermediaries using bitcoin will need to obtain a license - known as a "BitLicense." This sort of oversight is likely to mean bitcoin exchanges in the area will ensure their coins are "cleaner" and have not been soiled with some of the unsavoriness that has been associated - rightly or wrongly - with the nascent technology.     This could create an interesting price quirk and allow arbitrage trading - exploiting price differences between similar financial instruments. New York-based coins could be priced at a different level than their international counterparts. If the new regulation spreads to further U.S. states. then the opportunities would increase yet further.    Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, a bitcoin mercantile exchange, told CNBC via email that New York coins could trade at a premium of 2 to 5 percent.

Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, thinks the opposite could be true. Bitcoin holdings that fall outside of the regulatory purview of New York may be priced at a premium, he told CNBC via email.    "I can imagine the use of swaps, where bitcoins wouldn\'t actually have to change jurisdiction, and other mechanisms to arbitrage any price variations created by the Bitlicense regulation," he said.

And in terms of arbitrage trading, there could be a few hurdles. Savvy traders will need to fool U.S. bitcoin exchanges that they are not engaging in the reselling of bitcoin, according to Hayes. They\'ll also need banking relationships globally which is getting harder and harder to come by.    Only the nimble could reap the rewards.

A study by a Carnegie Mellon researcher offers an answer.    Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who went by the online moniker "Dread Pirate Roberts" after a character from "The Princess Bride," was sentenced Friday. He had faced a minimum of 20 years in prison after being found guilty on a range of charges, from drug trafficking to money laundering.     According to prosecutors, the site generated about $214 million in sales between early 2011 and late 2013, when FBI agents shut down the website, seized about $4 million in bitcoin, and arrested Ulbricht in San Francisco. In late 2011 and 2012, while the site was still active, Carnegie Mellon\'s Nicolas Christin gathered eight months of data that shows the 20 most popular categories on Silk Road.     Marijuana was No. 1, followed by the nonspecific category "drugs." As Christin notes in his paper, 16 of the top 20 categories are drug-related, with "soft drugs" like marijuana outselling "hard drugs" like opiates. "This presumably simply reflects market demand," he wrote.     Other categories, like "services" and "digital goods," also offered illicit purchases like hacking services and pirated content, according to the FBI. The large "books" category included titles like "Hacking for Beginners." The fourth nondrug category was erotica.   Over the eight months the Carnegie Mellon data cover, the number of unique sellers on Silk Road more than doubled. Most of the sellers\u201444 percent\u2014shipped from the U.S., followed by the U.K, the Netherlands and Canada.

At that rate, the site would have sold a little more than $40 million in the 34 months it was in operation\u2014although the higher estimate by prosecutors could be accounted for by rapid growth in the last year.     That wouldn\'t be surprising, as average daily sales increased by 44 percent in just the months that were measured, and most customers seemed satisfied with their buying experiences\u2014about 98 percent of all posted feedback was positive.

Greece and the euro zone need a quick, simple solution that allows Greece to stay in the euro zone and retain ownership of its plentiful and prized assets. An IOU currency isn\'t the answer \u2014 but there is one solution that could work.    This past Wednesday, Greece was able to make a 200-million euro (US$224 million) interest payment to the International Monetary Fund, but only by requiring all state enterprises \u2014 including schools and pension funds \u2014 to transfer reserves to an account at the Greek central bank.  Next Tuesday, Greece faces an even bigger payment of 750 million euros to the IMF.  As of now, it is unclear how Greece will manage to make this payment.  Read MoreGreece makes $224 million payment amid \'nail-biting\' talks The situation has become unsustainable, even though there has been no shortage of solutions. However, implementation has been a significant hurdle.  In particular, privatization of Greek assets is a lengthy process that has run into political resistance.  Adding to the urgency, the recent sharp rise in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese interest rates suggests markets are fearful of contagion if Greece were to exit the euro zone.    The European Central Bank is apparently working on an IOU-based secondary currency similar to the IOU\'s used by California in 2009, according to a Reuters report last month. Interestingly, Yanis Varoufakis (Greece\'s new Finance Minister) wrote a blog post in February proposing a similar currency, which he dubbed Future Tax Coin (FT-Coin).      In both of these cases, the secondary currency would borrow tax revenue from the future to pay for obligations today. Furthermore, the secondary currency would be tantamount to a T-bill that was backed by the full faith and credit of the Greek government. As a trust-based financial instrument, acceptance would be a function of the confidence in the Greek government to collect future taxes.  Without a way to easily spend the IOU currency, it would likely go unused by government employees and thus have no impact on economic growth. These limiting factors make it clear that an IOU currency issued by a government under financial stress is not a workable solution.   Read More\'Grimbo\': The new thing to worry about in Greece    Using block-chain technology (the technology behind bitcoin) there is a simple and elegant way for Greece to monetize assets and pay government employees.     While Greece may not have the liquidity to satisfy its current obligations it does have enough illiquid assets to solve much of its financial problems.  According to Eurostat, as of September 2014, Greece held 86 billion euros of financial assets on its general government balance sheet.  As a percentage of GDP, this makes Greece the 7th wealthiest nation in the EU. As a point of reference, financially sound Germany ranks 17th on the list of state-owned assets as a percentage of GDP.    Given the amount of assets held by Greece, the solution to its financial problem becomes evident \u2014 it must monetize the assets. This understanding has not escaped the IMF, euro zone and the ECB (the troika), but it has run into resistance from the citizens of Greece. Greece needs a method to monetize state-owned assets while still maintaining ownership. In my opinion, a digital currency based on block-chain technology can provide the solution.    Instead of selling assets in what will likely be a fire sale, the Greek government could use block-chain technology to create an asset-backed digital currency that can be used to repay creditors and pay government employees.  Initial proceeds from the sale of the currency could be used to meet obligations to the troika, while government employees could be paid in this parallel currency.     To make this work, the government of Greece would place a portion of its assets into a trust. Then a digital currency would be issued and backed by this basket of assets.  The mechanism for tying the assets to the currency would be a smart contract embedded in the currency that would not allow Greece to sell any asset in the basket unless the holders of the digital currency are paid.   Read MoreGreece deal: Seriously, what\'s holding it up?    This approach is a hybrid of a parallel currency and an asset-backed security.  Combining the attributes of a digital currency and an asset backed security would result in several benefits.       1. Greece would retain ownership of its highly prized state assets, satisfying the voter mandate to curtail privatization.      2. The currency could be used to pay government salaries and workers would be able to spend the currency at local businesses providing a much-needed economic boost.      3. This creates an investable asset that would be a proxy for a recovery of the Greek economy.      4. Greek banks could hold this hybrid asset instead of T-bills; the asset backing would immediately strengthen bank balance sheets.   I want to be clear that this proposal is not suggesting Greece leave the euro zone \u2014 in fact, just the opposite. This new digital currency would work in parallel with the existing financial system. This would allow Greece to benefit from remaining in the euro zone while internally expanding money supply and paying off debt. As well, it could quell fears of contagion by providing a template for other liquidity-challenged countries.     It is useful to note that this solution does not need to be implemented nationwide \u2014 the flexibility and scalability of digital currencies allow a stepwise progression. It is possible for municipalities and agencies within the government to adopt this solution individually.    While many proposals sound good on paper, they are often not reasonable to implement. In order to ground this proposal in reality a "One Thing Challenge" has been issued to the block-chain technology community. Over the last few days, the community has been challenged to provide a working prototype of technology that aids in the implementation of the parallel currency.  Start-up and established companies have been given a global stage to demonstrate products based on block-chain technology.   Read MoreEurogroup: No Greek deal by Monday, but it will get done    In my view, this is an opportunity for real-world implementation of block-chain technology. This is not a solo act; it will require a collaborative effort. To that end, a wiki page has been created where block-chain technology firms can submit and discuss all the technology that will be needed.  On May 20, I will be hosting an online symposium where companies will have the opportunity to present their piece of the workable solution.      Importantly, reasoned disagreement is welcomed as the solution requires examination from multiple angles.      Let this serve as an open invitation to contribute. Everyone is invited to be a part of the solution by submitting proposals at www.drachmae.org.  This is not a pie-in-the-sky proposal; there is already a company with a mobile-banking solution and payroll function that will enable the Greek government to pay government workers via mobile phones.  Another company is working on storing asset ownership records in a block chain so that ownership can be verified and tracked by everyone.    The goal of this project is to create a decentralized organization that can provide a usable solution for Greece and illustrate the potential for block-chain technology. We are fortunate to have this powerful technology at our fingertips and now is the time for the block-chain community to demonstrate its game-changing potential.

The "Free Republic of Liberland" has received no official recognition, but celebrated its first "Liberty Day" on May 1, doling out honorary citizenship to the first 100 attendees to arrive at the party in country. Its "president", Vit Jedlicka, is a 31-year-old Czech, who is a former financial analyst and self-described libertarian. He said that long-term, he hoped Liberland could become a successful financial center due to its loose tax laws.   "I would categorize it as a tax heaven," Jedlicka said. "The reason why Liberland was created was that the rest of the world ended up being a tax hell."   Nearly 300,000 people have already applied for Liberland citizens, 80 of whom are billionaires, according to Jedlicka.    Jedlicka and two other Czechs formed the new state on April 13 on a patch of woodland near the Danube River between Croatia and Serbia in South East Europe. Liberland said the area was left unclaimed following a border dispute between Croatia and Serbia in the 1940s. For much of the 20th century, both states were part of Yugoslavia.     The new country measures only 2.7 square miles in area, meaning it would rank among Vatican City and Monaco as one of the world\'s smallest "micro-states."    Jedlicka said forming Liberland was an attempt to shake up the political status quo.    "I tried for five years to change something in politics, but taxes were still rising, regulations were more and more intruding into people\'s lives, so I sort of found out that I couldn\'t change it for better," Jedlicka told CNBC.    "My political opponents always told me I should create my own state to show how my liberalism would work. And then I did."       Neither Croatia nor Serbia has recognized Liberland\'s sovereignty. In an official statement sent to CNBC, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Jedlicka as a right-wing politician and said the "newly created country" was outside Serbia\'s territory.   "The Ministry also considers this a frivolous act which needs no further comment," the Serbian Ministry added.     A spokesperson for Croatia\'s Foreign Ministry reiterated a Facebook comment posted shortly after Liberland declared independence in mid-April.    "Virtual quips, no matter how interesting they occasionally sound, remain what they are\u2014virtual quips, and for them we do not have any official comment," the spokesperson said.    But Jedlicka still hopes to gain recognition from other nations and has already set up an an office in Serbia that he plans to convert to an embassy.  Liberland\'s founders have pulled out all the stops, providing the country with its own laws, constitution, flag and motto: "To live and let live."   For those who missed gaining citizenship on Liberty Day, the country continues to accept citizenship applications online. Anyone is allowed to become a citizen as long as they have a clean criminal record and "do not have communist, Nazi or other extremist past."     Jedlicka said costs of developing and running the country would initially come from citizens, some of whom had already helped raise $15,000 to fund accommodation for the 20 volunteers running the presidential office.    Liberland will be run as a constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy, according to its website. Any currency will be accepted, including Bitcoin, Jedlicka said.

The Wall Street bank announced late Wednesday that it had struck a partnership with a major Chinese investment firm, IDG Capital Partners, to lead a $50 million investment into Circle Internet Financial, a start-up that aims to use the technology underlying Bitcoin to improve consumer payments. Since first grabbing widespread attention in 2013, Bitcoin has been dented by criminal activity tied to the virtual currency and by flurries of speculative buying and selling. The price of one Bitcoin on Wednesday hovered around $225, far below the high above $1,200 that it hit in late 2013.   Even as public interest has waned, however, major financial institutions have been quietly but seriously examining the opportunities offered by the technology, and particularly the new financial network that hosts the Bitcoin digital tokens and allows them to be sent around the world securely, cheaply and almost instantly.    A few other Bitcoin companies have recently announced small investments from European banks, and several bank executives have spoken of their interest recently. But Goldman is the first major bank to make such a prominent investment.   "Having a franchise like Goldman Sachs as an investor, who has done due diligence, is a vote of confidence," said Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and chief executive of Circle.    The investment is coming from Goldman\'s principal strategic investments group, which generally puts money into projects that could have some relevance for the bank\'s own business.     Goldman did not comment on the investment beyond a statement from the head of the principal strategic group, Thomas F. Jessop. The statement did not mention Bitcoin, but did say that the firm sees "significant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation."   Circle, which does not generate Bitcoin, had previously received investments from venture capital firms like General Catalyst Partners and Breyer Capital.  Unlike most big Bitcoin companies, which have focused on making it easier to buy and sell Bitcoins, Circle is hoping to use the virtual currency primarily as a way to cheaply and quickly move money both domestically and internationally. Circle customers who want to buy and hold Bitcoin will be able to. But for those who do not want to deal with the volatile price of the virtual currency, Circle is preparing to make it possible for customers to keep balances in dollars in an insured bank account. For these customers, Bitcoin will be used only as a means of moving money, to avoid the fees charged by payment processors and money transmitters.  The network underlying Bitcoin is generally a cheaper alternative because it is powered by a decentralized network of computers rather than a single company, like Visa or PayPal, that can extract fees.     The founders of Circle are aiming to use Bitcoin to move into the burgeoning industry of peer-to-peer payments. The industry is currently led by companies like Venmo, a PayPal-owned application that allows friends to quickly send one another money rather than using a check or a bank transfer, which can take days to go through.     While Circle will, in the near future, offer much the same services as Venmo \u2014 including free, instant money transfers \u2014 the company hopes that Bitcoin will allow it to move money with same ease across international borders, something Venmo cannot do.  Are regulations a boon or bane for bitcoin?  Speaking to CNBC at the Smart Nation Innovations 2015, David Moskowitz, founder of Coin Republic, discusses the regulatory treatment of bitcoin in countries like Singapore.    The international ambitions should eventually be helped by the participation of IDG Capital, a firm that has backed some of China\'s biggest start-ups.      Bitcoin gained popularity as a speculative investment in China in late 2013, but the government there shut down much of the excitement by barring payment processors and banks from dealing with Bitcoin companies. Mr. Allaire said that IDG should help Circle navigate the tricky regulatory landscape in China.      While Circle did not provide the size of Goldman\'s investment, Mr. Allaire said that Goldman and IDG had provided the majority of the $50 million.  Circle already had a tie to Goldman through M. Michele Burns, the former chief executive of Mercer who serves on the boards of both companies.      Goldman is one of several banks that have recently written research reports about Bitcoin\'s potential. A Goldman report in March listed Bitcoin among the four "megatrends" that are likely to transform payments, which it called a $1.2 trillion industry.    More from the New York Times: The Money Issue: Can Bitcoin Conquer Argentina?Winklevoss Twins Aim to Take Bitcoin Mainstream Data Security Is Becoming the Sparkle in Bitcoin      "Although Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are still in the early stages of development, they could gain traction once clear use cases become more established," the report said.      In the United States, many Bitcoin start-ups have been hampered by the unwillingness of banks to open accounts for virtual currency companies. So far, Silicon Valley Bank has been almost the only American bank willing to deal with companies that hold Bitcoins for customers.      While Goldman will not be Circle\'s bank, and will not hold any Bitcoins itself, its investment in Circle should help solidify Bitcoin\'s reputation as a technology that serious financial firms can work with.      Many banks have been waiting for more clarity on how bank regulators view Bitcoin companies. New York state\'s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, is completing a BitLicense for virtual currency companies that is expected to be out in late May.     Circle intends to apply for a BitLicense, and already holds ordinary money-transmitter licenses from many other states.      "Up until now Bitcoin has really been driven by the speculative value phase," Mr. Allaire said. "We\'ve said it needs to move to the utility value phase."

CNBC explains bitcoin, a payment system that uses virtual money for online transactions. It\'s like cash for the internet transferred by a mobile app or computer program.

(Tweet this)   The "automated online shopping bot" was set up in October last year by Swiss art group, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, as an art installation to explore the "dark web"\u2014the hidden, un-indexed part of the Internet.     Each week, the robot was given $100 worth of Bitcoin\u2014 the major hard-to-trace cryptocurrency\u2014and programmed to randomly purchase one item from Agora, an online marketplace on the dark web where shoppers can buy drugs and other illegal items. The items were automatically delivered to a Swiss art gallery called Kunst Halle St Gallen to form an exhibition.    The robot was christened "Random Darknet Shopper" and its purchases included a Hungarian passport, Ecstasy pills, fake Diesel jeans, a Sprite can with a hole cut out in order to stash cash, Nike trainers, a baseball cap with a hidden camera, cigarettes and the "Lord of the Rings" e-book collection.    Perhaps unsurprisingly, the robot and his artistic creators had a run in with the law. In January 2015, the Swiss police confiscated the robot and its illegal purchases.     However, three months later, the Random Darknet Shopper was returned to the artists, along with all its purchases except the Ecstasy (also known as MDMA) tablets, which were destroyed by the Swiss authorities.   The artists behind the robot escaped without any charges.    "This is a great day for the \'bot, for us and for freedom of art!" !Mediengruppe Bitnik said in a blog post last week.

Last week, U.K.-based Learning Enterprises Organisation (LEO) unveiled a trading platform in Hong Kong for its cryptocurrency called LEOCoin, which the company is promoting as an alternative to more popular digital currencies like bitcoin.     At a London launch the previous week, LEO boasted that it had already promoted the product to its current client base, claiming it meant over 100,000 entrepreneurs were already actively using the cryptocurrency in anticipation of its official trading debut, with around 30,000 merchants already signed up.    It also claimed this made it the "second largest digital currency" in the world, second to bitcoin, but has been slammed by reports on industry websites in the last week. Joel Dalais, a virtual currency entrepreneur and the director of bitcoin exchange IBWT, said on cryptocoinsnews.com that LEOCoin was a "good example of what a pump and dump coin looks like."  He also dismissed its claims of its sizeable usage as "bulls*t."  Read MoreBitcoin gets a rival\u2014how will it fare?   An article by another industry website, called CoinDesk, delved into the history of project founders Dan Anderson and Atif Kamran and said that both were caught up in a controversy surrounding a suspected pyramid scheme, called UNAICO Pakistan, that was warned by the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan in 2012.   Published online, the report by the Pakistani SEC said it had received various complaints from the public claiming that UNAICO was a pyramid scheme. The letter, dated April 2012, concludes that the company\'s activities did "broadly fall" within the definition of "fraudulent activities" and gave a recommendation to shut down the firm.    LEO\'s Dan Anderson is named as being the CEO of UNAICO at the time and Atif Kamran was also linked to the company through Sitetalk, a social community platform that is described as a "sister concern" by the Pakistani commission.    A pyramid scheme is usually described as a program whereby participants try to make money by recruiting new members to the scheme before the program collapses and some members lose money. The CoinDesk article quotes an expert witness in the prosecution of pyramid schemes, William Keep, as saying that some of LEO\'s business model does raise questions, in particular highlighting that it provides incentives for users to recruit others.    LEO, meanwhile, has strongly refuted these claims telling CNBC via email that they were "completely untrue."   "Dan Anderson and Atif Kamran have never been involved in any sort of scam and the comments about them have misunderstood the facts entirely," a spokesperson for LEO said in the emailed statement.    Both resigned from UNAICO and Sitetalk after disagreeing about the direction the business was taking, according to the statement, which said that they had also ensured reimbursements for those that lost money. They have been officially discharged of all liabilities and cooperated fully with authorities in all of these matters, the spokesperson added. The company also aimed to cool talk that it was artificially inflating its user base. At the event in London in March, LEO conceded that the cryptocurrency was targeted more at small and medium-sized businesses - especially in emerging economies - rather than the large conglomerates that have started to accept bitcoin.   A few examples of merchants revealed to CNBC that used LEOCoin were a Pakistani company called Capital Motors, a financial services firm in Slovenia called Profitus Skupina and a German-based energy efficiency services firm called Transformer.     A U.K.-based equine sports massage company called Happy Horse World is also on its roster as well as Strel Swimming, a U.K. based online company that organizes swimming tours around Europe. Borut Strel, a director at Strel, told CNBC via telephone that the company had only seen between 10 and 15 transactions made using the cryptocurrency, but predicted the sector as a whole was on the verge of a "new era."    The more popular bitcoin is a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining. A plethora of so-called "altcoins," or alternative coins, have sprung up alongside bitcoin. Dogecoin, which was initially started as a joke in 2013 and is based on an internet meme, is still the sixth largest digital currency in terms of market capitalization, according to coinmarketcap.com.

Incensed that central bankers continue to meddle with the macroeconomy? Good news: There are more concepts in the works to create currency standards backed by physical commodities than ever before, thanks to the creative crypto-thinkers behind the digital currency revolution. Anthem Vault plans to launch a gold-backed crypto-coin in May. The bet is that the coin\u2014which is redeemable for 1 gram of gold at the market price\u2014will be a big hit with investors who are tired of bitcoin\'s wild ways.    Bitcoin has been on a roller-coaster ride, losing more than half its value last year.    Anthem Blanchard, CEO and founder of physical gold and silver broker Anthem Vault, thinks that his cryptocurrency, called the Hayek, will bring more stability to the Wild West digital currency marketplace. Matching the ancient currency of gold with a new medium of exchange makes sense, Blanchard said, adding, "Seeing bitcoin combined with gold is exciting. Crypto-gold is more secure and spendable."   Read MoreFinally, a bitcoin ETF!    Anthem Vault is no stranger to gold-backed cryptocurrencies. Last year the firm tested investors\' taste for a gold-backed coin with its Independence offering, but that was linked to only a small amount of gold. So far, 700,000 Independence coins have been redeemed.    George Soros\' son, Alexander Soros, has even invested in the Canadian start-up BitGold\u2014which lets you redeem bitcoin for gold\u2014through Soros Brothers Investments.    The gold-backed currencies are not the only ones to emerge since bitcoin\'s fall from grace. Another one is backed by fertilizer and yet another by medical-grade cannabis. Each is a small part of the more than $4 billion cryptocurrency marketplace mostly dominated by bitcoin, according to the website coinmarketcap.    Gold-backed cryptocurrencies look the most promising, according to some experts.    For example, Nofiatcoin, a gold- and silver-backed digital currency launched last year, has managed to be strong\u2014despite the bitcoin crash. Nofiatcoin, which is actively traded, has already risen from its launch price of $1 to near-$18 on April 1.    Other commodity-backed cryptocurrencies are more esoteric. Consider the Uro Foundation\'s UroCoin, also launched last year, which is supposedly backed by 1 metric ton of a widely used fertilizer called urea. It\'s meant to track the rise in energy and food prices.   CannabisCoin, one of the more actively traded commodity-backed currencies on the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex, has been gaining traction. The coin is backed by 1 gram of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis.   Read MoreProfiting from the booming pot business    There are already 500 different cryptocurrency offerings. Picking winners is, at this point, a difficult proposition.    "We may end up with over 2,000 cryptocurrencies," said Carol Van Cleef, co-chair of the global payments practice at the law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. "And some will be commodity-backed."     How far have the creative crytpo-thinkers taken the idea already? Even beyond physical commodity backing for currency. Van Cleef pointed to a cryptocurrency coin backed by babysitting services issued at a co-op in Israel.    For now, though, more stable cryptocurrencies, like gold-backed versions, are receiving the most attention.     "Bitcoin is too volatile," said Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University. "This is why alternatives are springing up." Redeemable gold-backed cryptocurrencies may help solve that problem by being pegged to volatility of the bullion, which has been used for centuries to back currencies. "That\'s an advantage," Harvey said. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies backed by commodities such as fertilizer or rice can be driven by less-predictable events, like blight or famine, and wild swings in commodities, Harvey said.    In theory, anyone can create a cryptocurrency, because it\'s based on an open-source code that anyone can copy. "It only costs $40," said Carl Mullan, author of "The Digital Currency Challenge." But he added, "People may not even buy them. They\'re like penny stocks."    Mullan favors redeemable gold cryptocurrencies. "I would buy them first," he said.    Read MoreHow you can make money off hackers    Van Cleef said the redeemable gold concept only works if investors can trust the provider to actually back up their promise\u2014no sure thing in a period of market experimentation. Mullan pointed to the gold-backed cryptocurrency Minacoin, which he said has disappeared. A lot of other digital currencies have come and gone, too, and once they fail, there hasn\'t been a way for investors to get their money back, Mullan said.     "How do you know the cryptocurrency\'s value is really there? What happens if something goes wrong? Can it be sold or redeemed?" Van Cleef said. "The value of these cryptocurrencies is only as good as what backs them."    Not all cryptocurrency concepts will be well-structured as market offerings. So the key to buying these crypto-coins is knowing where the gold\u2014or any commodity\u2014is being held.    "Any good company should be audited," Anthem Vault\'s Blanchard said. "And you should know who the operators are." In Anthem Vault\'s case, gold bricks are housed in Salt Lake City.

It\'s been called "bitcoin\'s golden moment," and some see it as the start of the financial trend of the future. The Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) is just about ready for public trading. The fund, whose share price would be about one-tenth of one bitcoin\'s selling price minus fees, has cleared all of its regulatory hurdles, and many shares have surpassed their year-long holding period, according to Barry Silbert, the founder of Digital Currency Group, which owns the fund\'s manager Grayscale Investments.   All that\'s left is for BIT shares (which trade at ticker symbol "GBTC") to be moved into shareholders\' brokerage accounts, a process that should be finished by next week, and "then it\'s up to them if they will sell," Silbert said.    The BIT\u2014which cannot technically be called an exchange traded fund because it does not yet have Securities and Exchange Commission approval\u2014received the go-ahead from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to trade on the over-the-counter markets. But while these exchanges may conjure up images of boiler rooms and penny stocks, the BIT will be on the higher-standard OTCQX marketplace.  Read MoreBitcoin\'s golden moment: BIT gets FINRA approval    There are about 1.4 million BIT shares outstanding, and about half of them have been held for more than a year, Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale\'s director for sales and business development, told CNBC.    Although trading has not begun for the fund, there are already several pending orders, Sonnenshein said, with the lowest bid at $20 and the highest topping $35. The latter offer would value a bitcoin at more than $350. The cryptocurrency traded around $244 Monday afternoon.    "That\'s a pretty meaningful premium," Silbert said, explaining that the business model calls for the share price to eventually come closer to reflecting the trading price of bitcoin. For now, however, he said he expects that investors will be willing to pay some premium for BIT shares because it offers them ease of use and storage.  This is bitcoin\'s watershed moment: Trader Fast Money Trader Brian Kelly talks about the first U.S. regulated bitcoin exchange being a watershed moment for the digital currency.   If, however, potential investors do not want to pay for relatively expensive shares on the open marketplace, BIT\'s authorized participants (such as banks and broker firms) can go out and create more shares at a cost of close to that day\'s bitcoin price. While this is a cheaper option, new shares are subject to a one-year holding period, which means they are better suited to long-term holders than day traders.    In addition to the pricing premium for free-trading shares, Grayscale charges an annual 2 percent administration and safekeeping fee. That charge is steeper than most ETFs, said Eric Mustin, vice president of ETF Trading Solutions at WallachBeth Capital.  Read MoreWill 2015 be bitcoin\'s year?    In fact, he said, BIT investors could be paying 5 percent more than if they simply bought bitcoin on an exchange\u2014when considering Grayscale\'s fee, and issues with setting a fair price in a relatively non-liquid market.    "People who read tabloids deserved to get lied to, and that\'s how I feel about someone buying a bitcoin ETF," he said. "If you\'re confident in this currency that you want to buy it, but you can\'t take the 30 seconds to set up a wallet, which is incredibly easy, then you deserve to pay the 5 percent or whatever."    "I\'m not cynical about bitcoin, but I just think it\'s a goofy way to trade it," he added.    For their part, Grayscale representatives justified the annual fee by citing the 1 percent charges to put money into and take money out from most bitcoin platforms and exchanges. "From a cost perspective you\'re no worse off," Silbert said.    "The difference is we handle the custody so you don\'t have to worry about safekeeping, and you can hold in brokerage accounts," he said.    Sonnenshein also noted that a share in BIT is a titled security, so investors have more protection than if they were simply to write down the key to their own bitcoin wallet on a slip of paper.  Read MoreBitcoin gets first regulated US exchange    The agreement to potentially pay a price premium will probably appeal to two groups of investors: retirement accounts and the wealth management community, Silbert said.    While there is a lot of money in retirement funds, "up until now there\'s been no way to invest in bitcoin through a tax-efficient account," he said. And the wealth management and financial advisor crowd has expressed interest in the BIT because it represents a way for firms to keep client money in in-house accounts while satisfying any desires for bitcoin speculation.    "Given the amount of publicity that bitcoin gets, any firm that is managing individual accounts, there\'s a chance that one of their clients has called their financial advisor and asked, \'How do I invest?\' " Silbert said.  Digital currency\'s future Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss join CNBC\'s Bob Pisani to discuss their new bitcoin exchange. The pair also has plans for a bitcoin ETF.    The BIT may also represent a smart tool for investors who don\'t want to risk putting their money in the hands of exchanges (some of which have suffered scandals throughout bitcoin\'s young history), according to trader Brian Kelly.    "If you\'re going to put any real money into bitcoin the last thing you want to do is put any money on an exchange," he said. "This gives you that kind of security."    But even if some investors see the appeal of the BIT, it may soon have competition.    Investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have been pitching a bitcoin ETF for some time and are going through the regulatory process of applying through the SEC. Their fund, which would trade on the Nasdaq and have the ticker symbol "COIN," is seeking to list 1 million shares, according to a recent filing.   Read More Winklevoss twins: Bitcoin plunge a buying opp    While Kelly allowed that some traders may find the Winklevoss ETF more appealing because it does not trade on the OTC markets, he said he did not think that the added draw would be significant.    "Really, you are talking about technicalities. If you want to just buy bitcoin they are similar," he said.    For his part, Silbert was confident about the future success of BIT (and its first-mover advantage) compared to any would-be competitors. "The way we think about it is the race is already over," he said.    The "ultimate end goal" is to register BIT shares with the SEC, and trade the fund on the New York Stock Exchange, Silbert said, adding that he cannot give any assurances of what the future may hold.

U.K.-based Learning Enterprises Organisation (LEO) is the company behind the new cryptocurrency. Traditionally it has been providing learning services to the business community, which has even stretched to the odd yoga session for company executives, but has now turned its attention to LEOCoin.     Similar to the more established bitcoin, it has already promoted the product to its current client base. The company therefore claims it has 131,176 registered businesses ready to use LEOCoin, potentially making it the "second largest digital currency" in the world. Its own exchange LEOxChange will kick into life on April 2 but the coin will also be recognized by existing exchanges.  Read MoreWhy the world\'s banks should stop shunning bitcoin    "This industry (so far) has been like the Wild West," Dan Andersson, the co-founder of LEOcoin said at an event Wednesday morning, which took place at the Tower of London. His colleague and co-founder Atif Kamran called digital currencies the "evolution of money" and extolled its benefits for the e-commerce community.    The more popular bitcoin is a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.    The cryptocurrency has sparked interest among venture capitalists on both sides of the Atlantic but has also run into regulatory issues in many countries. Currency analysts have also warned of its unstable nature and the Bank of England has also provided reach of the hypothetical risks that it poses to financial system.    LEOCoin boasts that its currency based on newer technology than its rival but Andersson admits that the two will essentially co-exist. He also said that it would have greater usability and accessibility than other cryptocurrencies. It provides instant transactions and no commission fee on purchases, according to the press release, although sales will be subject to a transaction fee.    Bitcoin daily transaction volumes are still dwarfed significantly by credit card transactions, according to industry website coinmetrics.com, and are also lower than more established payment systems like Western Union and Paypal. A number of so-called "altcoins," or alternative coins, have sprung up alongside bitcoin. Dogecoin, which was initially started as a joke in 2013 and is based on an internet meme, is still the sixth largest digital currency in terms of market capitalization, according to coinmarketcap.com.    Jon Matonis, a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization aimed at promoting the cryptocurrency, is lukewarm on the addition of a new "altcoin", telling CNBC via email that there are too many of them.  Read MoreLondon aims to become a bitcoin hub    "What matters is the computational power and strength of the network," he said. "Bitcoin\'s lead via the network effect is very strong."    In a survey designed to highlight the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, LEOCoin commissioned a poll of 1,000 senior decision-makers from small- to medium sized businesses. It revealed that 50 percent of respondents thought transaction fees were a key concern when doing business. Of those surveyed, 43 percent who transacted using debit or credit cards were worried about the associated costs, the survey said.    Perhaps more worrying is that the same poll showed that around 70 percent of respondents were "not at all likely" to accept a digital currency in the future. Andersson called this an "opportunity" rather than a challenge and underlined that it wasn\'t trying to win over current bitcoin users but was trying tap into the global SME sector using its basis as a business solutions and learning provider.

Coyno CEO discusses Levin Kellner, co-founder and CEO of Coyno, discusses the impact of bitcoin at events like CeBIT, and whether the virtual currency is stalling.   The bitcoin cryptocurrency system will have nearly 5 million active users by 2019, but it will still remain a niche marketplace, according to new research.    Although several big-name retailers have begun accepting the fledgling digital currency, its user base and transaction volume will only see modest gains, a report released Tuesday by market insight firm Juniper Research predicted. Because of relatively slow consumer adoption, the report, The Future of Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin & Altcoin Impact & Opportunities 2015-2019, advised retailers to not bother with the technology.      "To my mind there are far more pressing needs for the retailers, there are so many other payment options emerging," Windsor Holden, head of forecasting and consultancy at Juniper, told CNBC. "It\'s not a key differentiator for a retailer that you offer bitcoin\u2014it\'s not going to be a unique selling point."   Holden, who authored the new study, predicted that bitcoin\'s active user base will rise to about 4.7 million by 2019 from about 1.3 million in 2014.    That growth, however, will not directly translate to an increase in the value of bitcoin transactions. In fact, the Juniper report predicts a major drop in the total sum of transaction values for 2015, followed by a gradual increase through 2019. The paper attributes this fall in part to temporary trader concerns over the cryptocurrency\'s future.    And there are several major impediments for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\' (generally known as altcoins) ascension to the mainstream, Holden said. He pointed to three things keeping the technology within a relatively narrow world: The prices of these digital assets have gone through significant volatility since their inception, exchanges have suffered thefts and mysteriously missing funds, and becoming an active consumer or retail user requires some tech know-how.  Read MoreBitcoin just got serious    "These all make it exceedingly difficult to bring bitcoin, to bring altcoin, into the mass market," he said, adding that technologies like Apple Pay should be the focus of most retailers.    Still, the volatility issue will likely decline, Holden said.    Juniper\'s analysis expected that some kind of regulation would occur on cryptocurrency exchanges in the short to medium term, which should calm the price movement somewhat, he said.', 'publisher': 'CNBC', 'author': {'twitterurl': u'http://twitter.com/Ev_Rosenfeld', 'name': u'Everett Rosenfeld', 'twitterhandle': u'Ev_Rosenfeld'}, 'url': 'http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/17/bitcoin-to-near-5m-active-users-by-2019-remain-niche-study.html', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 17, 18, 20, 26, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -14400)), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin to near 5M active users by 2019, remain niche: Study'}, {'articleText': u'   It was hard to go through 2014 without hearing about a bitcoin company going bankrupt, or the alleged "father" of the digital currency being involved in a car chase\u2014but the market might have just got slightly more professional.     A Germany company has launched a platform where bitcoin users can track transactions from all of their wallets in one place, to help users of the cryptocurrency file tax reports.    Users of Coyno\u2014which went live as a beta version six weeks ago\u2014can combine wallets from six providers, including Coinbase, and display them in one place, a tool which is useful for people with several wallets.

Coyno\'s platform allows you to see exactly where and who you have sent it to, much like a bank statement, enabling customers to track spending. The start-up does not facilitate transactions however.   Levin Keller, Coyno\'s CEO, said he hopes the software will be an "enabler" for the bitcoin sector. It was created in response to people being put off the digital currency because of accounting issues, he said.   "A lot of people are convinced bitcoin is a great idea and professionals would use it, but say: \'OK that\'s fine, but what do I say to my accountant?\' Because the accountant would say it was crazy to have bitcoin on the books," Keller told CNBC at tech fair CeBIT in Hanover, Germany.    "I heard this frequently and this was a reason for people not to use bitcoin. It is a headache for bookkeeping."   Coyno said it was going to release a tax reporting feature in its program as an increasing number of businesses looked to accept the cryptocurrency as payment.     On Tuesday, Japanese internet giant Rakuten said it would accept bitcoin on its e-commerce platform, while everything from beer to tuition fees can now be paid for with the currency.    In the U.S., bitcoin is seen as an asset and is subject to capital gains tax, while in Germany, it is subject to income tax.    "The main issue is bitcoin is seen as an asset. So when you get that on your books, and the value changes and you buy stuff with it, you get a benefit and that is measured in money. This is a gain that you need to be able to declare and pay taxes for, especially if you are a corporation in the U.S.," Keller said.    So far Coyno has just 200 users. It charges 20 euros ($21.20) a year for a personal account. For companies, Keller said that the fee would likely depend on the number of transactions being made.     Keller told CNBC the company is aiming to raise 200,000 euros ($212,630) of funding to keep it going until the end of the year, and a further 1 million euros in 2016 to help it grow.

About 80 percent of bitcoin volume is now driven by the Chinese yuan, according to data from Goldman Sachs. The U.S. dollar is the second most used currency for transactions, followed by the euro, the bank said in a new report.    The bank\'s findings correlate with data from Bitcoinity, a popular website used to track market data. A look at trading volume over the past six months reveals China\'s yuan accounted for 77 percent of total market share, compared with 19 percent for the greenback and just 1 percent for the euro.    China\'s high trading activity comes despite recent moves by the People\'s Bank of China (PBoC) to clamp down on the crypto-currency. The central bank banned financial institutions from bitcoin trading in December after warning that the currency was essentially a vehicle for speculation. Earlier in 2014, the PBoC also took measures to prevent bitcoin companies from gaining access to payment processors.    However, Goldman Sachs believes the mood is gradually improving: "However, in light of a somewhat stabilizing Bitcoin economy in China, a few payment processors have reemerged, such as BTC China\'s JustPay."

But what if you want to buy and hold bitcoin as an investment? Or, what if you want to diversify your investment portfolio into this new asset class, but do not have the expertise or resources to securely procure and store bitcoin?     One solution to this problem has been the Bitcoin Investment Trust  (BIT), which holds bitcoin in a trust in which investors can then buy shares. The BIT has been a private vehicle open to accredited investors since 2013, but that is about to change.    On March 1, 2015, Grayscale Investments (the sponsor of the BIT) announced that it has received regulatory approval from FINRA for the fund to trade publicly on an electronic platform operated by the OTC Markets Group.    This announcement ensures that the BIT will be the first publicly traded bitcoin investment fund and could pave the way for more stability in the price of bitcoin. It is also possible that a publicly traded fund like the BIT could have the same effect on the price of bitcoin as the SPDR Gold ETF had on the spot price of gold.   Read More Bitcoin needs better consumer protection    When GLD began to trade, the spot price of gold was trading just above $400 per ounce. Prior to launch of the GLD, in order to purchase and store gold, investors needed to call a broker who specialized in buying spot gold and then arrange for storage. This meant opening new accounts and paying for vault space.     Alternatively, many investors opted for the simple solution of buying gold coins and storing them in a safe deposit box. However, this method was not very efficient and as a result investing in gold was difficult for the average investor.     Once investors had an ETF option, the diversification into gold began in earnest. Propelled by ease of investment and a well-timed financial crisis, the price of gold more than quadrupled to over $1900 in 2011.    I have previously written about the inverse relationship between the price of bitcoin and merchant acceptance. There has been a flawed assumption that merchant acceptance will push the price of bitcoin ever higher. However, the evidence suggests differently. In fact, it appears that increased merchant acceptance has been a drag on the bitcoin price. The following chart illustrates that as bitcoin transactions increase the price declines.   The best explanation for this phenomenon is that as merchants receive bitcoin they immediately convert to fiat currencies. This selling pressure could be a big driver of the downward slope in price despite corporations like Dell and Microsoft accepting the digital currency. However, the public listing of the BIT could change this relationship.    There is really nothing mysterious about financial markets, they simple represent a place where buyer and seller agree on price, but disagree on value. If the seller values fiat currency more than bitcoin (perhaps to pay employee salaries in US Dollars) then they are more likely to accept a lower price.  Read MoreHow I'm dodging bitcoin's flaw   On the other side of the bitcoin transaction is the buyer which currently consists of long term investors. A falling price suggests that the sellers either outnumber the buyers or are more aggressive in terms of price.    Presently there is very little competition between buyers, but an easy on-ramp to investing could change that dynamic. As long term investors enter the space the BIT may provide the needed competition for a scarce resource that will push the price higher. This is exactly what occurred when GLD was launched.      Competition for a scarce resource is not a development unique to digital currency - this is the way markets have operated for thousands of years.

Bitcoin is here to stay: Authors Paul Vigna and Michael Casey, "The Age of Cryptocurrency" authors, make the case for Bitcoin as a viable currency in years to come.   Since its inception and meteoric rise, the biggest problem with bitcoin has been volatility. The familiar refrain goes something like this: "why would a merchant hold a currency that can fluctuate 10 to 20 percent per day?"  The answer is that they won\'t and don\'t.  Despite the logical answer, many have been flummoxed by the falling price of bitcoin even as major companies like Dell and Microsoft have begun accepting the digital currency. Most assume that merchant acceptance is a bullish sign for the price of the currency.  However, reality illustrates the exact opposite.   Read MoreThe iPhone is Apple\'s biggest problem: Analyst The following chart depicts the price change in bitcoin vs. the number of transactions taking place with bitcoins. I have used the 30-day rolling average to capture the time from when a merchant announces acceptance to when the customer starts using bitcoin.  Anecdotal evidence suggests there is usually an early flurry of activity when a merchant announces acceptance of bitcoin and then the excitement fades.    What\'s striking about this chart is that the price of bitcoin rises as the number of transactions fall \u2014 quite the opposite of the expected outcome.  One reason for this inverse relationship could be that, as new merchants receive bitcoins, they immediately convert them to fiat currency.  For example, DELL may have seen a large influx of purchases with bitcoin that were immediately converted into U.S. dollars to pay U.S. dollar expenses.  Additionally, the volatility of bitcoin has been a deterrent to merchants holding onto bitcoin.   Read MoreWill 2015 be bitcoin\'s year?  This is why the announcement of a bitcoin futures-and-options broker is so exciting.  Merchants will have more options to hedge bitcoin exposure which eventually could lead to fewer merchants immediately converting to fiat.  In turn, fewer conversions will likely lead to a higher price and a virtuous cycle can commence.  Derivatives can have a dampening effect on volatility which will encourage more businesses to accept and hold bitcoin. For speculators waiting for next leg up in the price of bitcoin merchants holding onto bitcoins received is a requirement for price appreciation. As a quick aside to those who may believe derivatives are the cause of volatility not the solution \u2014 I will simply say that leverage causes volatility, not derivatives.  Digital currencies are quickly becoming a new financial asset class for investors, traders and businesses.  As early adopters profitably hand off to the next wave of institutional investors, the ecosystem will likely grow at an exponential pace.  High-profile investors are a sure sign of an economy that is not just surviving; it\'s a sign that it is thriving.  It is becoming increasingly likely that the 2014 reports of bitcoin\'s death have been greatly exaggerated.

Crypto Facilities was set up by former bankers from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas and Societe Generale.  The platform pitches itself as a broker which specializes in bitcoin derivatives, and trades financial products like options and futures which are directly linked to the price of the cryptocurrency. Thus, it allows users to "go long" and bet that the price of bitcoin will rise, or "go short" and bet the price will fall. Timo Schlaefer, the co-founder and CEO, was previously the executive director of credit quantitative modeling at Goldman Sachs in London. Speaking to CNBC via telephone Wednesday, he said he had worked for the investment bank for ten years but left to create this brokerage firm. "I really wanted to help this industry develop and bring the experience that I have," he said.  Schlaefer added that he saw real potential in the technology behind bitcoin - the block chain - which is a publicly-distributed ledger system which makes sure all transactions are verified in a transparent, decentralized and secure fashion. Crypto Facilities is officially regulated by the U.K.\'s Financial Conduct Authority. However, the regulator only oversees the company\'s traditional derivative operations, as there are not yet any official regulations on the digital currency in the country. Like Schlaefer, the Bank of England has also said it sees huge potential for the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin.    In a report in September, the central bank said it could have far-reaching implications and the potential to reshape the financial industry. However, the bank also outlined a series of hypothetical risks that the currency could pose to the U.K.\'s financial stability.  The risks included a bitcoin price crash on the back of unhedged exposures by important financial institutions, or if investors became leveraged via derivative contracts.    Schlaefer responded to the research, saying that derivatives tended to have a "smoothing effect" on prices and that the company would use the same risk management tools and supervision as it does on its more traditional operations.    Bitcoin is the most popular of the "virtual" currencies which allow users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.     Singapore-based Coinarch is another bitcoin trading firm that deals with derivatives for the cryptocurrency, and Schlaefer told CNBC that anecdotally he knew of other firms in Russia, China and the Seychelles that also had similar platforms.  \u2014By CNBC.com\'s Matt Clinch; Follow him on Twitter @mattclinch81 ', 'publisher': 'CNBC', 'author': {'twitterurl': u'http://twitter.com/mattclinch81', 'name': u'Matt Clinch', 'twitterhandle': u'mattclinch81'}, 'url': 'http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/25/ex-goldman-director-aims-to-hedge-your-bitcoin-risk.html', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 25, 9, 1, 24, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -18000)), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Ex-Goldman director aims to hedge your bitcoin risk'}, {'articleText': u' Jury: Silk Road founder guilty on all counts Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht has been found guilty on all 7 counts, reports CNBC\'s Mary Thompson.

Prices have been in freefall, trading below $250 throughout January compared with $1,000 at the same time last year, according to CoinDesk, a widely-watched price index.

"We predict that volatility will stabilize as more high-quality exchanges become established and more users come online," said Adam Tepper, CEO of Australian bitcoin exchange Independent Reserve, in a note last week. The lack of regulation is a barrier to mainstream acceptance, he said.    The launch last week of the first licensed exchange in the U.S. - the Coinbase bitcoin exchange - is a positive step for the currency and Tepper expects other exchanges to follow suit.    "The high-profile Mt. Gox collapse in 2014 highlighted the need for better technology and security controls for bitcoin exchanges, much as the U.S. flash crash highlighted these issues for traditional securities markets," Tepper added.

As a result of an unregulated marketplace, bitcoin theft has thrived, Juniper Research said, referring to the recent theft of nearly 19,000 bitcoins from U.K exchange Bitstamp, the second largest dollar-bitcoin exchange.    Public perception of bitcoin is closely associated with illegal online purchases and remains a major turnoff for widespread usage.

"There may be some fluctuations in the value of bitcoin as a result [of dangerous activity], but no more than we would expect from fluctuations in the U.S. dollar or any other existing currency, which we know are used for things like financing terrorism."    Tepper agreed that bitcoin is no more vulnerable to inappropriate activities than other currencies.

The protocols that created the Internet in 1973 took Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn just nine months to write. The architecture was known as packet switching: messages were broken into small packets of data with address headers telling them where to go. Then, that data scurried through a web-like network of nodes and recombined at their destination.    One feature, or flaw, of the system was that you couldn\'t track the packets back to their origin. Unlike a phone call, there was no way to trace the source. This allows clever hackers using proxy servers almost total anonymity.

Proposals have already been made through the Internet\'s "Request for Comments" process for such improvements as DomainKeys Identified Mail, a service that, along with other authentication technologies, aims to validate the origin of data and verify the sender\'s digital signature.  Even more promising might be to use the blockchain system that undergirds Bitcoin.    The blockchain is a brilliant way to assure that a particular transaction or piece of information is authentic. It now is used to guarantee the validity of the digital cryptocurrency. The same system could be used to guarantee the validity of a person\'s signature or transaction.  Read MoreLet\'s get digital! Ecuador\'s new currency  There are, no doubt, many other clever ways to create a system on the net that securely validates a person\'s identity and the origin of a message. Insurance companies, banks, health care companies and other early adopters could require such authentication and block messages from domains that aren\'t validated. That could tip the balance a bit against the hackers trying to get into our health records, and phishers who want to tap into our bank accounts.    Alternatively, the same systems could also be used to permit transactions with total anonymity, for those who would prefer that.  Whether it\'s based on the blockchain that enables Bitcoin or some other authentication system, it\'s time for some innovators to create the next layer of the Internet. Something is needed to tip the balance a bit against those trying to hack into our health records, or phish for ways into our bank accounts.

It confirmed that it produced information for 58 percent of government and civil requests and 64 percent of U.S. state and federal government requests.  Some 30 percent of the civil and U.S. federal or state government requests received included a court order prohibiting Reddit from notifying users. The company also said it successfully fought back against two civil subpoenas that sought to unmask more than a dozen anonymous users. "When we receive a request, we make sure it is legitimate and not overbroad, and we provide advance notice to affected users unless prohibited by a court order or where we decide delayed notice is appropriate based on clear criteria described in our privacy policy," Reddit said in its report.

"I see a pendulum swinging back and forth in public sentiment, where you saw (U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden) swing that pendulum very heavily towards privacy. Now, with some of the recent issues that have arisen, that pendulum has swung back towards security," she said during a seminar at the event.   Yahoo has said that it received 6,791 data requests from the U.S. government in the first six months of 2014 and just 20 percent of these -- 1,396 -- led to content being disclosed.

The price of the digital currency bitcoin rose sharply on Monday with news that the U.S. is set to have its first regulated exchange.    San Francisco-based Coinbase offers storage services for bitcoin users, and the company is set to open a new exchange on Monday morning. Called Lunar, it will have regulatory approval in half of the states in the U.S., according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, including New York and California.    "A proper U.S. exchange that\'s trustworthy, that\'s insured, we were the first guys to get insurance on our bitcoin in some form, this will really help bring a dampening of volatility," said Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam on CNBC\'s "Squawk on the Street."    The company last week announced a major new round of funding and has now raised $106 million. The New York Stock Exchange and Spanish bank BBVA are just some of the company\'s high-profile backers, along with USAA bank, the investment arm of Japanese telecom NTT DoCoMo, and former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit.  "I think the New York Stock Exchange sees this as an important trend," said Ehrsam. "Really, what\'s happening in the background is, you\'re seeing some hedge funds dip their toe into the water in bitcoin in increasing amounts. It wouldn\'t surprise me if you see some banks get involved here at some point, as well."  Bringing bitcoin to Wall Street Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, discusses the company\'s $75 million funding round and shares his vision for the future of bitcoin.   Bitcoin is a virtual currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. There is no central bank that issues them. Instead, bitcoins are created online using a computer to complete difficult tasks, in a process known as mining. The digital currency is renowned for its volatility and has been heavily criticized for facilitating illegal activity, given that it can be used anonymously.     Jeffrey Robinson, the author of "BitCon: The Naked Truth about Bitcoin" is one such notable critic. He told CNBC previously that he believed it was a "pretend currency masquerading as a pretend commodity."    The insolvency of Japanese exchange Mt. Gox and the recent trading suspension at Bitstamp, the second-largest dollar-bitcoin exchange, has hurt the reputation of the cryptocurrency and has dented the price, which tanked by around 65 percent in 2014.    Monday\'s news caused its value to spike, however, and is likely to inject some much-needed trust back into the digital currency. It saw a 16 percent jump on Monday morning and was trading close to $300 for one bitcoin, according to industry website CoinDesk.  "To be clear, it\'s insurance against bitcoin loss," said Ehrsam "On top of the fact that we\'ve been operating successfully in the U.S. for about 2 1/2 years, the largest bitcoin company has insurance to back it all up."   This is important news for the U.S.-based exchange marketplace, according to Jon Matonis, the founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, which is a not-for-profit organization which aims to promote and protect the cryptocurrency.    "It will be a true floating-rate exchange with various order types," he told CNBC via email. "U.S.-based floating-rate exchanges contribute less than one percent to overall global trading volume for bitcoin, so I would expect that percentage to increase significantly."  Protection against hackers and security breaches is also a top priority for the company, according to Ehrsam. He says the Coinbase site goes far beyond normal bank security and notes that the site has been operating without incident thus far.    Access to Coinbase\'s exchange, which comes ahead of a similar project by the Winklevoss twins, will only be available in states where it has approval, the WSJ reported.     However, it appears that a merger between Coinbase and the Winklevoss twins may not be in the cards in the foreseeable future. "We feel pretty good about our engineering team and about the product that we\'ve launched," said Ehrsam. "They [the Winklevoss twins] obviously were onto a pretty good theme here in that the U.S. really did need a regulated bitcoin exchange, but I think we\'re pretty happy with what we\'ve put out there.     Meanwhile, New York regulators are currently weighing a raft of new rules to regulate bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The New York State\'s Department of Financial Services has proposed issuing a "BitLicense," which it said would protect consumers, prevent money laundering and enforce cyber security. Coinbase\'s new exchange will act under current regulations.   CNBC\'s Everett Rosenfeld contributed to this article.

While 2014 may be remembered as the tumultuous teenage phase \u2014 with the implosion of Mt. Gox, multiple exchanges hacks and an outright price crash \u2014 2015 marks bitcoin\'s ascendance into adulthood.  This announcement will mark the emergence of a new asset class; one that is uncorrelated to other financial markets and will be similar to investing in the Internet in 1994.   The Wild West reputation of digital currencies will quickly be forgotten as institutional investors enter the space.   Markets have the unique ability to make even the smartest people in the room look silly. It was barely a month ago that the Guardian newspaper wrote this: "Bitcoin halved in value over 2014. That\'s a pretty bad investment, and could spell doom for the currency."   Read MoreBitcoin gets first regulated US exchange   To be fair, at the time, the price of bitcoin had crashed and sentiment was at an all-time low, but the Guardian made the classic investment error of confusing perception with reality. When I first read the article, I was reminded of the BusinessWeek cover in August 1979 that declared "The Death of Equities." That was right before the stock market entered the greatest bull market of a generation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 882 that year and within 20 years had climbed above 11,000. For mathematically challenged, that is a 1200-percent return. What a way to die!   So, what\'s next for digital FX?    The launch of a regulated U.S.-based exchange opens the door for bitcoin and digital currencies to fulfill their destiny.  In my view, this destiny includes becoming a new asset class for investors. Digital currencies need not be limited to a single blockchain. In fact, multiple digital currencies would add to the decentralized appeal. As the institutional investment community becomes acquainted with digital currencies, they will begin to see the multiple use cases for these new assets.  Moreover, these new assets will be uncorrelated with more traditional investments, which will enhance the diversification of investment portfolios.   Read MoreRussians move into bitcoin as ruble tanks  Some of these use cases have been well documented, including solving micro-payment problems within the music industry and serving the under-banked. A regulated U.S.-based exchange will encourage more investment dollars to enter the space and will lead the discovery and launch of bitcoin\'s first \'killer app." That is to say, the app that allows everyone to finally see the promise of this technology. There are well over  400 digital currencies in existence with a market cap of $4.9 billion \u2026yes, billion with a "B." Each of these currencies should be thought of as its own app.  Larger cap currencies like Ripple and Stellar are taking aim at the international payment systems, while (currently) smaller cap currencies like Digibyte have been developed to tackle micro-payments. The investment opportunity lies in the ability to buy into the "app" or currency before widespread acceptance.     In 1994, few predicted that the Internet would enable live video streaming on a handheld computer that doubled as a phone \u2014 but that\'s exactly what we have. The arrival of institutional investors in digital currencies is a big bang event.  If you have doubted the viability of digital currencies, today may be a good day to re-evaluate this emerging asset class.   Read MoreWill 2015 be bitcoin\'s year?

The Alpine resort plays host to a slew of policymakers, economists and central bankers every year. Topics usually include global growth, inequality and climate change but the nascent industry of digital currencies has managed to eke out a place on this year\'s agenda. "From bucks to bitcoins," is the title of the seminar due at Davos on Friday afternoon. It explores how the mainstreaming of digital finance could disrupt financial services and transform consumer behavior. This is a far cry from last year, when the most notable mention of the cryptocurrrency was when it was openly criticized by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon on CNBC. Bitcoin is a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining. The digital currency is renowned for its volatility and with its ability to keep users anonymous it has been heavily criticized for facilitating illegal activity.   The price of bitcoin has suffered recently, with a dip to $200 from $300 since the turn of the year. It was also given the rather dubious title of the "worst investment of 2014" by some news organizations with prices starting 2014 at over $800.    Wences Casares, the founder and CEO of California-based bitcoin services firm Xapo, believes that like the rise of the Internet, it was only a matter of time before the cryptocurrency got it\'s foot in the door at Davos.   "It\'s gold 2.0...it\'s substantially better than gold," He told CNBC on the outskirts of this year\'s event. His company is banked in Switzerland and provides storage services for bitcoin users. It\'s not the first time he\'s been to the event, but the first as a representative of a bitcoin-related company.   Rather than trying to gain more investment, Casares is in Davos to spread the word of bitcoin or "evangelize," as he put it. Casares believes that in 10 years\' time, traditional banks will look more like multi-function telecoms firms and believes that bitcoin will form part of that transformation. Bitcoin quietly obliterated CNBC\'s Sara Eisen reports on the fall in the price of bitcoin.   If a lack of regulation and no central bank is enough to turn the stomachs of the global elite then there are alternatives at the annual economic shindig.     Ven is a digital currency that actually predates bitcoin and is backed by a weighted basket of currencies, commodities and carbon futures trading.    Stan Stalnaker is the founding director of Hub Culture, which is a social network service that operates the digital currency. He travels to various global events, setting up pavilions with the intention of showcasing Ven. After nine years at Davos, the company now has prime real estate in a small pop-up opposite the front entrance of the main conference center.   Davos attendees can use the digital currency for a range of options this year such as paying for apartments, taking a toboggan trip or even splashing out on a new Nissan.    Stalnaker told CNBC that Ven has similarities to a gold exchange-traded fund and has a group of financial gurus that oversee operations and act as a central bank. He also said that users aren\'t anonymous but the stability and its environmental interests mean it has several unique selling points that bitcoin doesn\'t have.

Those are just some of the charges that 30-year-old Ross Ulbricht, the accused founder of the anonymous black market site Silk Road, will be facing when his trial kicks off in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday.    Read MoreWhat hackers are really selling on the \'Dark Web\'   And although the case grabbed headlines 15 months ago because of the lurid nature of the allegations, the implications of the trial go beyond mere illegal activity. The case could reveal details about how the government monitors Internet activity, and potentially expand legal liability for commerce in contraband online.    Ulbricht, also referred to as Dread Pirate Roberts, was arrested on allegations that he created and operated Silk Road, a marketplace website on the so-called Dark Net that enabled users to anonymously buy and sell things using Bitcoin as a payment method.     While Silk Road enabled the sale of a variety of goods and services, it was also a hotbed for the sale of illegal drugs.     Ulbright, who was also charged with running a criminal enterprise, has maintained that he is not guilty on all charges. But if he is convicted he faces 20 years to life in prison.    Read MoreThe \'Dark Web\' market for illegal guns and drugs grows    The outcome of his case, though, may also have broader implications for Internet freedoms and businesses.   How illegal e-commerce works How are people able to sell and buy drugs, guns, stolen credit cards, and other illegal products online? CNBC\'s Dina Gusovsky reports.  Ulbright\'s case could be a huge wake-up call for people using the Dark Web under the impression their activity is anonymous, and could also shed light on how the government tracks people in the dark corners of the Internet.    "What\'s most interesting about this case is that it is the first case in its enormity involving the Dark Net and it\'s going to be a wake-up for anyone using the Dark Net thinking they have anonymity. You cannot remain anonymous on the Internet," said Darren R. Hayes, assistant professor and director of cybersecurity at Pace University.     One of the most controversial issues regarding the case has been how exactly the FBI was able to track down the server that hosted the Silk Road website. This is being called into question because the server was used to produce evidence for the trial. Ulbricht denies that the server even belongs to him.    The feds claim that they were able to trace the server via a captcha prompt on Silk Road\'s website that leaked the site\'s IP address, which led to its location in Iceland. However, the defense claims this explanation doesn\'t add up and supporters of Ulbricht are quick to accuse the government of using a possibly illegal method to locate Silk Road, which they claim would violate Ulbricht\'s Fourth Amendment rights. However, since Ulbricht is denying ownership of the server, the judge declined to entertain this notion.     Regardless, the trial should give more insight to just how the government is watching behind the scenes.     "From a tech perspective it\'s going to be very interesting because we are going to learn in more detail about how the government is really able to track people on the Dark Net," Hayes said.    Beyond possibly revealing how the government may be tracking people, the case could also set a precedent for cases against other website operators.     "The main issue, the main Internet freedom issue is at what point are website operators accountable for what happens on their site? In Silk Road, it\'s an easy case because they were catering to illegal activity. But what is interesting is that you start with easy cases and then you start to go towards some of the borderline cases," said Hanni Fakhoury, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.    The government could use this case as a way to pursue other online operators who provide a platform that might be used for illegal activity, and that can get tricky, he said.

CNBC\'s Dina Gusovsky reports.    Almost everyone knows that things are bought and sold illegally online all the time, but most people don\'t know how the process works exactly.   Internet security expert Joseph Steinberg showed CNBC how anyone using a combination of bitcoin and specialized software can work through online marketplaces to sell just about anything.     Most property crimes are becoming "cyber" in one way or another, as a means for criminal networks to communicate, transfer funds or market illegal products and services, said Ken Westin, a senior analyst with cybersecurity firm Tripwire.   Read MoreTop 5 cybersecurity risks for 2015  Anonymity software such as Tor, used in combination with bitcoin, "is really helping to drive the growth of underground markets, so just like traditional businesses that have moved online to gain wider distribution, criminal entrepreneurs are following suit," Westin said.     Karen Reilly, development director for The Tor Project, said that Tor provides an important service by protecting people in countries that censor Internet connections and imprison Internet users for criticizing political leaders on social media sites.    "We work with ordinary citizens, reporters, law enforcement, victims of abuse, people with medical conditions, and other people who need to keep from being tracked online," she said.

"These users are a tiny fraction compared to the vast majority of people who just want to protect their privacy and freedom of expression."    Tor, which was once called The Onion Router, is used by some people for illegal transactions, but it was designed to protect information about democracy, religion and speech, said Mark Rasch, a former federal computer crimes prosecutor and the principal of information security firm Rasch Technology and Cyberlaw.   "I use it all the time when I want to be anonymous, or when I simply want to protect my privacy," he said.

The U.K.-based exchange said it would be halting withdrawals and dissuaded customers from making deposits following what it implied was a security lapse. Still, some have argued that this could be an excuse for a larger liquidity problem after the weekend\'s big drop in bitcoin\'s price.    "We have reason to believe that one of Bitstamp\'s operational wallets was compromised on January 4th, 2015," the company wrote in a message on its website.  Bitstamp maintains that less than 19,000 bitcoin (about $5.1 million at Monday\'s price) were lost after the security lapse, according to a spokeswoman. The exchange\'s customers can also "rest assured" that they will be able to recover the full amount of their cryptocurrency stored with Bitstamp before the suspension, CEO Nejc Kodri\u010d said in a statement provided to CNBC.    Here\'s Bitstamp\'s full Monday morning message:    Some, however, are not buying this explanation.    "Don\'t believe Bitstamp. It\'s a matter of liquidity," Jeffrey Robinson, author "BitCon: The Naked Truth about Bitcoin" wrote to CNBC. "Who\'s next? It\'s as if Bitstamp realized they couldn\'t internalize the risk anymore so just decided, Let\'s suspend operations until everything settles down."    Others are in agreement that Bitstamp\'s issues may go well beyond security. A commentary in the Financial Times posited that the issues could lie in the company\'s financials becoming unhinged by the falling price, or the economics of mining taking their toll on the exchanges.

Technologists, financiers and ideologues predicted that 2014 would be bitcoin\'s coming-out party, but the digital currency slipped more than 70 percent from the previous year\'s high. Still, some are claiming victory and predicting even more success for the future.    Bitcoin\u2014a digital currency started in 2009\u2014has consistently captured headlines since its meteoric rise from a few dollars to more than $1,150 in 2013, but experts say that the focus on its slide to the $300 range misses the point. Instead, they point to growing merchant adoption and consumer awareness as the year\'s high points.  As for the future, bitcoin-related business owners said they are looking forward to stabilization and legitimacy from impending government regulation.    "Regardless of the price, it was a huge year for bitcoin," said Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer at BitPay. "A year ago people didn\'t know if bitcoin was a fad, but today it\'s for sure that it\'s going to stay for a long time." One of the major criticism\'s of bitcoin is that it can never operate as a currency because its price is too volatile, but Singh said the latter part of 2014 saw the beginning of digital asset\'s maturation into stability.    This stabilization, he said, featured bitcoin trading at $290 in October, breaking above $425 in November and then settling around $310 at the end of December. Singh pointed to the recent announcement that Microsoft would begin accepting bitcoins as the prime example of a less volatile trading ecosystem.    "If we had made that Microsoft announcement at the beginning of the year, [bitcoin] would have gone up 50 percent," Singh said. "Microsoft is the biggest thing to happen to bitcoin, and it barely touched the price."   Read More3 reasons Wall Street can\'t stay away from bitcoin    Volatility aside, bitcoin saw a major price slide in 2014. Just why that has occurred, however, has proven a matter of debate.    One factor potentially weighing on the price was the February filing for bankruptcy protection by Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox, which saw nearly all of the exchange\'s 850,000 bitcoins disappear, according to Brendan O\'Connor, managing director for trading at SecondMarket.   Another potential reason for 2014\'s slide in price, some skeptics said, could be that bitcoin simply does not possess an adequate consumer use-case.   "The reality is that btcoin is possibly not safer, possibly not cheaper, possibly not faster than other means of distributing money from point A to point B," said Mark Williams, risk management professor at Boston University, adding that "bitcoin is seven times riskier than gold, eight times riskier than the S&P and 15 times riskier than the U.S. dollar."   Read MoreCNBC Explains: How to mine bitcoins on your own    Williams had predicted in December 2013 that the bitcoin bubble could burst and drop in value by more than 90 percent. For 2015, he took a more positive outlook, telling CNBC that the cryptocurrency could experience a boost if it successfully attains regulatory legitimacy.  Beyond bitcoin\'s fortunes as a traded asset, the cryptocurrency saw a string of positive announcements for consumer adoption.   In addition to Microsoft, many big-name companies\u2014including Dish, Expedia and Overstock.com\u2014began accepting bitcoin for sales during 2014. By giving consumers more ways to use bitcoins, enthusiasts said, the currency has begun to move away from its roots as a tool for illegal activities and speculation.    Those firms did not dip their toe into the bitcoin ecosystem without help: Companies such as Coinbase and BitPay act as payment processors that will instantly convert bitcoin transactions into local currency.   Read MoreBitcoin needs more consumer protection    "The merchant interest was a huge change that happened in 2014," said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. " If you go back to Jan. 1 in 2014, there were zero large companies in the U.S. that accepted bitcoin."    The cryptocurrency is also entering the consumer sphere in other ways, as so-called bitcoin ATMs popped up around the globe. The concept is to introduce bitcoins to the average person, whose interest might be piqued by a way to physically interact with the digital currency.    ZenBox, a Santa Monica, California-based company that provides such kiosks, has expanded its business to 18 locations. Using the kiosk, consumers can instantly buy and sell the currency with cash in hand. Bitcoin: Expect chaos and drama Chief Scientist at Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Andresen, says there\'s still "value" in the bitcoin, but he expects to see "chaos" and "drama" as the bitcoin ecosystem works itself out.\n   "For the general public or for the ecosystem in general, [bitcoin] is on the verge of explosion," said Cailen Sullivan, CEO of ZenBox. Sullivan said he\'s seen 50 to 200 users a month on a ZenBox machine, with average transactions of about one bitcoin.    But all of those consumer adoptions\u2014from both ATMs and mainstream merchants\u2014may not paint the whole picture of bitcoin\'s growth outside of tech circles.   Read MoreBitcoin\'s \'BearWhale\' and the future of a cryptocurrency    While the number of companies accepting bitcoin has roughly tripled, the number of people using the digital currency to purchase goods and services has not grown at all, said Jeffrey Robinson, author of "BitCon: The Naked Truth about Bitcoin."    In fact, Robinson suggested the consumer use of bitcoin has been supported by early speculators cashing out.    "I think what you\'ll see a year from now is probably 100,000 businesses saying \'we\'ll take it\' ... but the buying of goods and services begins to recede, and the price will slide down," Robinson said.    As for bitcoin\'s physical entry into the consumer world, Robinson suggested the ATMs "are all going broke because they can\'t afford the placement, and no one is using them."  The key to bitcoin finding more users in 2015 might lie in government regulation, experts said. Increased consumer protection, they said, would boost adoption as it both legitimizes the technology and reassures those on the fence about buying into the cryptocurrency world.   "If the average Joe sees that the U.S. government has OK\'d this technology and given guidelines for this technology to be built on, in their eyes that\'s legitimacy," Sullivan said.    Governments around the world are currently considering bitcoin regulation. Within the U.S. this charge has been led by the BitLicense currently under revision by Benjamin Lawsky, New York state superintendent of financial services. This license would certify businesses managing bitcoin transactions and require them to maintain certain records.   Read MoreBitcoin: Lawsky softens \'BitLicense\' requirements    Lawsky\'s office said earlier this month that the license should be finalized by early 2015.    Regulation will not only boost consumer confidence in the technology, but it will also remove many of the barriers preventing more companies and investors from becoming involved in the space, SecondMarket\'s O\'Connor said.    "We are very close to getting a regulatory framework in place, and that will be a huge boon for the industry," he said. "Once it\'s more black and white, you are going to see more institutional folks buying into the asset class, and the price will go up."    There are also challenges to overcome with the perception of bitcoin as a tool for crime. Earlier this month a district court sentenced high-profile bitcoin advocate, Charlie Shrem, to two years in prison for indirectly sending $1 million in bitcoin to the Silk Road\u2014an online black market known for selling illegal drugs.   Read MoreIs Apple Pay a bitcoin killer?    A reputation shift, bitcoin experts said, could come from increased company adoption and financial investment.    "I think this year bitcoin put the early days behind itself," Armstrong said. "It\'s really hard to argue that bitcoin doesn\'t have many legitimate benefits to companies that are legal businesses when you have Dell and Expedia and all these companies now accepting it."    Many big-name investors have also added legitimacy to the cryptocurrency by putting "their money where their mouth is" and doubling down on bitcoin technology, Armstrong said.    In fact, many alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) saw their fortunes rise and fall throughout 2014.   While many prognosticators focus on bitcoin\u2014the globally dominant digital currency\u2014some experts emphasize that being the first developer does not necessarily preclude someone else from creating a better alternative.

Read MoreForget currency, bitcoin\'s tech is the revolution    But this development is not necessarily welcome news for those holding on to bitcoins: Depending on which (if any) of these measures succeed, bitcoin could either become inextricably tied to the future of all digital transactions, or it could be relegated to historical curiosity.

Aspen Institute CEO Walter Isaacson discusses top innovators and new technologies that will shape 2015.   Mobile payments and Elon Musk are among several trends and innovators poised for a breakout year in 2015, according to one expert.   In an interview on CNBC, Walter Isaacson, author of the best-selling Steve Jobs biography, predicts people who are "unbanked" in society will soon be able to make Internet purchases more easily. Isaacson, chief executive of the Aspen Institute, said the lack of banking options available to some will prompt electronic payment systems to rise to the challenge.    "It takes four days to move money sometimes if it\'s just an average person [trying] to use things like checks and credit cards that have transaction costs," Isaacson said. Those  inefficiencies will spur the continued rise of mobile payments and digital currencies, which will eventually disrupt the banking sector.   Read MoreApple just got reinforcements in the mobile payment battle   An estimated 68 million U.S. citizens\u2014and some 2.5 billion across the world\u2014operate without access to a bank. Analysts say this market is ripe for the increasingly hot mobile payments sector.  A recent study by the Federal Reserve found that many unbanked consumers are already using smartphones to process financial transactions.   "I\'m looking for different ways that people will be able to just transfer money pretty quickly," Isaacson said.    Isaacson also sees growth in some forms of cybercurrency "building on the \u2026 bitcoin phase we had a few years ago." And the disruption to financial services won\'t just be limited to the U.S., he said.    "Globally, once you open up the market to the next billion people coming on line who can make cellphone text payments and that sort of thing, I think it changes the economy quite radically," Isaacson said    In his latest book, "The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution," Isaacson chronicles the pioneers and visionaries whose discoveries over the past 175 years led to the invention of the computer.    In the search for the next technology leader, Isaacson sees continued innovation from a familiar entrepreneur, the co-founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.   "Elon Musk is one of great innovators and disruptors of our time," said Isaacson, citing two technologies that will be in high demand given consumer preferences. "He\'s doing batteries, he\'s doing electric cars."    Read MoreElon Musk is losing out big time on cheap gas prices   Despite current low oil and gas prices, Isaacson thinks alternative sources of energy will continue to drive innovation, and change how drivers fuel up their vehicles. "It\'s no longer in our DNA to want to drive around in SUVs and Hummers and burn gasoline," he said.   Included in Isaacson\'s book is the work of Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page, whom he called "a great innovator." However, those changing the face of technology don\'t necessarily need to hail from large corporations.    It\'s "not often a big company [or] an established company can be innovative and disruptive," Isaacson said. But with the development of trends including self-driving cars, and wearable technology, "I do like the way Google keeps looking for ways" to shake up consumer technology.   As for future disruption on a longer time horizon, Isaacson is looking for big ideas from innovators working together.    After the explosive growth of Facebook, Twitter and new apps like Snapchat, the author hopes for more tech innovation in sectors beyond the traditional Silicon Valley route.      "We\'ve had a lot of social media plays over the last 10 years; maybe over the next 10 years will involve things that are more substantive," he said. "Disruptive ways to use big data in health care to do pharmaceutical things that can\'t be done ,,, in a garage, or a dorm room, but will take collaborative innovators."

Meanwhile, the Bank of England has released a study detailing the digital currency\'s virtues. So why, under the surface, is there a "chilling effect" threatening to derail a sector that could bring millions to the economy?    Around the world, mainstream banks afraid of fines and regulatory controls are shutting out firms that provide bitcoin-related services or even associate with the cryptocurrency.    Any bitcoin business can tell you how hard it is to set up a U.K. bank account. Global Advisors (Jersey) Limited (GAJL), advisors to the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), has claimed that HSBC shut down its account recently. Danny Masters, the director of the company - which is fully regulated in Jersey - told CNBC that the excuse given was that in HSBC\'s opinion GAJL no longer met the "risk reward" profile of the bank and was a "potential money laundering risk."  Read More Bitcoin set to take over the financial world: Book    Reports from industry website CoinDesk in September said that Wells Fargo in the U.S. have done similar with San Francisco-based startup called QuickCoin. In the Isle of Man, Capital Treasury Services (CTS), which provides financial services to bitcoin businesses, announced September that it was no longer working with bitcoin firms, citing the "highly regulated environment."    Meanwhile, the not-for-profit Bitcoin Foundation - which aims to promote and protect the cryptocurrency - has told CNBC that it has been repeatedly turned down for a U.K. bank account because "bitcoin" was in its name. Meanwhile in China, government pressure on state-lenders has even managed to roil the price of the digital currency.    If banks aren\'t interested, or too frightened of regulation, to handle bitcoin companies\' accounts, then many industry experts are warning that these businesses will move their funds offshore.    Jon Matonis, a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, says there\'s a massive "chilling effect" emanating from banking regulators in the U.S. that seems to be spreading around the world. "This stems from attitudes about bitcoin and its original source of funds," he told CNBC via email. "No bank wants to be fined in this current political atmosphere." Bitcoin is better than the dollar: Coinbase Brian Armstrong, co-founder of Coinbase, says bitcoin has better "properties" than the U.S. dollar as it relies on the "laws of math" rather than politicians.    Simon Hamblin, the CEO of U.K.-based exchange Netagio, calls it a "catch 22" but is unsure whether its necessarily regulation holding them back. "No one really knows. What is the banks\' requirements for these (bitcoin) companies? I don\'t know if even they know." His company Netagio is currently using banks based in Europe and Africa.    HSBC told CNBC that it doesn\'t discuss individual customers but added that it didn\'t take decisions to end customer relationships lightly and had identified a number of relationships that didn\'t meet its strategic criteria. Barclays said that it was currently assessing the sector but added there was currently no risk appetite for business with bitcoin-related companies.    Global regulators are busy listening to the industry with a view of implementing some sort of directives. These should be carefully considered and proportionate and will hopefully nudge the banks into realizing the error of their ways.    As Netagio\'s Hamblin puts it: "Innovation remains at an uneasy standstill. Time is ticking."

The ruble plunged more than 11 percent against the greenback Tuesday \u2014 its steepest intraday fall since 1998 \u2014 as traders dumped a currency that has crumbled on the back of weaker oil prices and sanctions against Russia by the West.   Volatile trading continued on Wednesday, with the currency gaining over 10 percent against the dollar, although it remains down 13 percent on the week.     Other than the dollar, the beneficiaries of this flight from Russia appeared to be the euro, the yen, sterling -- and bitcoin. Data from bitcoincharts.com, which tracks financial and technical statistics for bitcoin, shows that transaction volumes with the ruble spiked on Tuesday spiked to 819 from an average of 230 trades for the last 30-day period. This was close to a 250 percent increase in transactions and was the highest volume seen since December 2013, according to the website.

The exchange allows users to trade in rubles and its website can be displayed in the Russian language alongside Chinese and English. Data from bitcoinity.org shows that the exchange has seen a modest spike in ruble transactions in recent weeks.   The flow into bitcoin echoes a similar move seen in Cyprus in April 2013 when capital controls were placed on citizens who tried to take large sums of money out of the embattled euro zone nation. The restrictions were seen as one of the key factors behind a rally in the price of bitcoin as Cypriot investors tried to shift money beyond its borders.

"I\'d be surprised if Russians were turning to bitcoin in any meaningful way given the uncertainty over whether they could use it or store it without penalties in the future," he told CNBC via email.

Ultra-rich Russians now buy one in five of London\'s \xa310 million-plus properties, according to research by estate agent Knight Frank. The company told CNBC that its web traffic shows the number of Russians looking at London property was 13 percent higher in November 2014 than the same month last year. That figure was also up 9.5 percent from October, which it said was a monthly rise that bucked the trend of previous years.    "Rising super prime sales in the second half of 2014 suggests Russian buyers have been proactive against the background of economic and political instability by investing in the safety of U.K. real estate while the ruble has steadily declined," said Katya Zenkovich, who works at Knight Frank\'s Russian desk.

"Although the swings in absolute value seem to be lower in 2014 than they were at the end of 2013, the volatility will likely remain for the next few years," Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based market research firm KapronAsia told CNBC.    "Bitcoin is largely a binary outcome with it either being a tremendous success or reduced to something only used by enthusiasts. There is a tremendous amount of private equity and venture capital money being put into bitcoin to create new and compelling business models, but the only thing that will temper volatility is increased acceptance and usage," he said.    Bobby Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of China-based bitcoin trading platform BTC China agrees: "Volatility will be inherent for this new asset class.  The reason is simple: It has a small circulation value now, but theoretically, with wide adoption, the circulation value should be 100x or 1,000x what it is today," he said.  "The price would have to appreciate dramatically, and that would involve very high volatility for years to come."   Read More Forget currency, bitcoin\'s tech is the revolution    An over 8,000 percent price increase over the course of 2013 to its peak of around $1,147 early that December put bitcoin on the map. In early 2014, bitcoin\'s fall was just as quick; concerns about increasing government regulation and a market bubble saw bitcoin\'s value halve in just a few months.     Bitcoin is currently trading around $337 on the BTC-e exchange.   Driving forces for 2015    Developments on three fronts have the potential to drive bitcoin higher in 2015: a better usage model, more companies using blockchain-based technology and increased usage for remittances.    "Bitcoin is a technology that still needs to find its use case," Kapron said. "The iPhone defined an industry by giving consumers and businesses something that they didn\'t know that they needed. For bitcoin, there\'s no proven killer app, although numerous players are working on it. We need a bitcoin usage model in 2015 that does something better today than we did yesterday, and we\'re just not there yet."  Bitcoin: Expect chaos and drama Chief Scientist at Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Andresen, says there\'s still "value" in the bitcoin, but he expects to see "chaos" and "drama" as the bitcoin ecosystem works itself out.\n   Increased usage of blockchain technology will also boost bitcoin\'s appeal. The blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records every verified transaction. Each piece of information is stored on an immutable time-stamped list, which is then replicated on other servers across the globe ensuring protection from corruption, technological or otherwise.    "More companies are using this technology," Roger Ver, the bitcoin investor often referred to as "Bicoin Jesus" told CNBC. He highlighted Ethereum, which offers a platform and programming language that leverages blockchain technology for contracts and financial transactions, among other things. The company recently pulled around $15 million in a crowd funding campaign.  Google and IBM are also reportedly looking to invest in blockchain applications.  Read More The real advantage of paying with bitcoin    Remittances are another interesting case cases for bitcoin, Kapron said. "The idea of sending money nearly instantly anywhere in the world for cheap is very compelling. Companies are working on these solutions today, but still struggle to match the scale of established vendors like Western Union or the informal lenders that dot shopping malls across South-East Asia. This is developing rapidly though and could be big in the future."    Adoption and regulation    Adoption is likely to be driven by compelling use cases, not for regular purchases like groceries as credit cards and mobile payments are still more convenient, Kapron said.    But Ver believes wider adoption is highly likely: "as bitcoin becomes easier for non-tech-savvy people to use, adoption will increase."    If transaction volumes are anything to go by, he may be right. Bitcoin saw its highest ever number of transactions in a single day in late November, according to blockchain.info, surpassing the previous peak set during the 2013 bitcoin bubble.   Read More Bitcoin tanks, is Alibaba to blame?    Meanwhile, regulation still has the potential to hamper bitcoin.    "We\'ll also see additional regulation in 2015," Kapron said. "Many countries have yet to take a stance on bitcoin and digital currencies or haven\'t completely promulgated their rules."    "Governments all around the world care about this because this is real and important. Rules and regulation will continue to evolve, to accommodate this new asset class that is completely digital," BTC China\'s Lee added.    The Australian Senate\'s Economics References Committee said in October that it will hold an inquiry into the implications of digital currencies. It plans to present the results in March, 2015.    "Regulation itself will not stop Bitcoin," Kapron said, "but it could slow it enough that people lose interest or is replaced with something else."

When most people think of bitcoin today, they remember the salacious news stories of hackers making off with millions of dollars, or the hugely volatile currency that seems to have been created from nowhere. It's not necessarily thought of as secure and so it's quite understandable that many are skeptical and even critical of its future potential. However, what most miss in the discussion, is just what bitcoin really is at its core, which is the first true money that human kind has ever invented \u2014 and one that is programmable, so it can be built into everything.     Why do I say this? Well from the very beginning of time, humans have traded goods with one another, and have used money as proxies for these goods, as a simpler form of exchange. That money has taken the form of gold and silver, sea shells, promissory notes and State issued legal currency, to name but a few. In all these cases the money has been forged, cheated, stolen and its value decimated by inflationary tactics. Kings did it to pay off war debt, people clipped bits of gold coins, weighing scales were tampered with, the Federal Reserve was invented to control it etc. There is not a single instance until bitcoin, of a truly trustworthy form of money, one whose value was constrained not by the laws and weaknesses of man, but by the universal laws of mathematics.  Read MoreThe elephant in the room this holiday season   So bitcoin is really radical. It allows a secure system of exchanging value between people, and indeed machines, who have never met, that can be trusted, verified and never forged. Yes, we have heard of many instances of bitcoin hackers and thieves, but these are not security issues with the core bitcoin network per se, rather weakness in the storage of the keys used to secure a bitcoin wallet. Just like a bank vault with the combination lock code taped to the front door not being secure; bitcoin secured by keys left lying around where they are easily stolen are not safe from theft either.  So with bitcoin, we have a secure, programmable form of money that can be used for global transactions, that cannot be forged, that is fully audit-able, that is actually software that can be built into anything and everything. Once this is understood, once this is grasped, the magnitude of the possibilities it enables is truly staggering. That's what has all these venture capitalists salivating and that's what has thousands of the smartest programmers in the world working feverishly to unlock the potential of. It's a magnitude of change and possibly similar in scope and scale to the Internet itself, and it's just the beginning.   Read MoreIs Apple Pay a bitcoin killer?    Bitcoin has another interesting property that is worth mentioning. It's a bearer instrument. That means, just like a dollar bill, the person that holds it and presents it as payment is the de-facto owner. Why is this an important property? Well, we live in a world where we are expected to disclose our identity and financial future to companies that are just not qualified to secure it, just to shop online or eat in a restaurant.  We have all seen this recently with the hacking thefts at Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase and Target to name just a few. Credit-card fraud and identity theft actually cost us over $5 billion a year, and ruin many lives and dreams. Bitcoin solves this problem, once and for all, because using it, we, as consumers, do not have to risk our financial future when we do things like our Christmas shopping. Bitcoin payments are anonymous \u2014 at least as far as merchants are concerned. The data trail that bitcoin leaves behind is indeed traceable using the blockchain, with the right tools. It can be used to fight crime and terrorism, it can be used to identify us, but importantly it cannot be used to steal our identity, or to steal our money, or to impact our credit rating. So it's a much more palatable and secure approach to payments than credit cards can ever be. So, when we ask the question, what needs to happen for the mass adoption of bitcoin to occur; the answer is just time. In time, the money the venture capitalists are investing and the code the developers are writing will bring forth systems and solutions to problems that are just not feasible or practical without Bitcoin. Just like the browser makes the Internet accessible to everyone, these systems and solutions will make bitcoin accessible to everyone and will change the way we interact, trade, spend and receive money. Whether that's peer-to-peer lending, peer-to-peer finance, distributed capital formation, secure voting, or solutions to transparency in finance and derivates. The technology has so much potential, and it just cannot be un-invented. Its adoption really is inevitable.

This extraordinary scenario is the central theme in "The Bitcoin Big Bang" by Brian Kelly, investor and contributor to CNBC\'s "Fast Money." Kelly says the transformation is as near as a decade away. "If the Industrial Revolution was the catalyst for modern economies to move from an agrarian to a manufacturing society, then the Bitcoin is the vehicle that will transport the financial system from centralized to decentralized," writes the author, who runs Brian Kelly Capital from Greenwich, Connecticut. "Over the next decade, creative destruction will be the mantra within financial services, and it will all be due to an anonymous genius who gave his/her/their invention away for free." Read MoreGreat Black Friday deals you can get with bitcoin Bitcoin has a long way to go. Right now, it remains a hobby for wealthy members of the tech jet set with only a few obscure retailers like Overstock.com accepting it as payment. Still, some serious venture capital money is lining up behind exchanges and applications based on bitcoin. Also, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service finally officially recognized it this year. Even an exchange-traded fund is currently being reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval. The price of the digital currency was near $380 on Monday, down 67 percent from its all-time high reached in November 2013, according to Coinbase.com. Much of the fall came after the Chinese government blocked payment processors from recognizing digital currencies like bitcoin because they were being used by citizens to send money out of the country, subverting capital flow restrictions. These kinds of hiccups will be common for bitcoin along its journey to world domination, Kelly explains. But once more and more people realize how unique, secure and programmable bitcoin is, the sky\'s the limit, he writes. Bitcoin: Expect chaos and drama Chief Scientist at Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Andresen, says there\'s still "value" in the bitcoin, but he expects to see "chaos" and "drama" as the bitcoin ecosystem works itself out.\n   "The current financial system relies on centralized institutions acting as the traffic cops and collecting a fee for this service," he writes. "The Bitcoin solution ... holds the potential to decentralize the system."    First, the basics on bitcoin as explained in the book: It was created by an anonymous person who calls himself (or herself) Satoshi Nakamoto. This person, whose true identity has still not been disclosed, released a white paper amid the 2008 credit crisis explaining the digital currency. He and subsequent bitcoin "miners" created the early units of the currency shortly thereafter.    Each unit has an encrypted key which fits uniquely into a spot in the so-called blockchain. Every piece of bitcoin created has a unique spot on this blockchain. This special construction ensures security during transactions as well as prevents counterfeiting.    Because of these security features, bitcoin removes an essential element that was thought to be necessary for every financial transaction: trust.    If trust isn\'t needed, one doesn\'t need that middleman when making a wire transfer (credit card companies), states the author.    The middleman needed to ensure both parties meet their commitments for a home, car or business loan (banks) isn\'t needed either.    Kelly writes:    "The Bitcoin protocol replaces the banker with the miner and by doing so removes the cost of a middleman. The traditional role of the banker was to be a trusted third party, watching every transaction and verifying validity. Satoshi Nakamoto designed a way for a computer to replace a banker. Bitcoin can accomplish this task securely through the use of cryptography."    Even the Federal Reserve is expendable, as bitcoin doesn\'t need a large governing body to tell everyone it is sound. The computer code ensures that, notes Kelly.    And because there is a natural process of creating bitcoins through its encrypted mining process as well as an already-determined maximum amount that can be created, it doesn\'t need the Fed\'s money supply function either.    What may not be known to many, but is essential to Kelly\'s financial takeover thesis, is that each bitcoin has the ability to be programmed with smart instructions. For example, it can be programmed to release a certain amount of money over a designated period of time.    This "smart contract" can be embedded into the bitcoin security encryption; therefore, the parties can\'t flake on their commitment once it is digitally signed.    "The smart money features of Bitcoin can even be used to eliminate trust banks when transferring generational wealth," writes Kelly.   Read MoreThe big problem with bitcoin regulations    Bitcoin can even streamline the once-thought-to-be-difficult securitization process\u2014the purview of investment banks\u2014through this programmable interface.    "Traditional bankers stand at the center of the financial system and ensure that money moves from one rightful owner to another," Kelly writes. "The Bitcoin miners do the same thing but without the need to employ thousands or erect skyscrapers."    Credit card companies, threatened by bitcoin\'s ability to transfer money around the world at virtually no cost, apparently already hear the footsteps. MasterCard filed a patent in June of this year to integrate bitcoins into the company\'s global shopping cart, according to the book.    To be sure, bitcoin has a long road ahead before taking over the whole financial system, which Kellly acknowledges. Before bitcoin and bitcoin digital wallets are widely adopted and accepted, one must still use U.S. dollars and a credit card company to buy bitcoin through an exchange.  And while bitcoin is trustless and secure in a vacuum, these exchanges are not. They are only as secure as their firewalls.    The failure of of Japan\'s Mt.Gox exchange last year after a hacking was proof of that. Millions of dollars in bitcoins are still missing.    And until Fidelity and JPMorgan Chase close down due to competition from bitcoin-backed upstarts, grandma and grandpa are nowhere close to moving their checking and retirement accounts over to a bitcoin-based system.    Bitcoin may be a trustless transaction system, but a majority of people must understand and trust it can function as such before it starts replacing currencies and related financial middleman on a large scale.    But Kelly, who got his start in the business ironically as an intern for Lehman Brothers, was admittedly a skeptic at first, too.    It was the collapse of his former employer and the disappearance of trust in the financial system in its wake that led Kelly and many others to find bitcoin and ultimately believe in it.       Hopefully, another crisis of that magnitude isn\'t what\'s necessary for bitcoin\'s mass adoption.    "The financial crisis of 2008 fertilized the ground for economic change," the author writes. "Bitcoin and the blockchain will play a starring role in the new economy."  "The Bitcoin Big Bang" by Brian Kelly is published by John Wiley & Sons.

Kraken is a bitcoin exchange based in San Francisco and is owned by Payward Inc. On Wednesday the company published a new blogpost detailing the deal saying that it had been selected to support an investigation into the missing bitcoins, as well as the distribution of remaining assets to Mt. Gox\'s creditors.     Mt. Gox made headlines back at the start of the year when it filed for bankruptcy protection before being placed into formal administration in April. Mt. Gox once claimed that it handled around 80 percent of all global dollar trades for bitcoin, but its success soon turned sour. It came to light that it had outstanding debts of about 6.5 billion Japanese yen ($63.6 million), 850,000 lost bitcoins and 127,000 empty-handed customers.   Read MoreBitcoin needs more consumer protection    CEO Mark Karpeles became a figure of hate within the industry and a small clutch of protesters gathered outside the headquarters of the Japanese exchange, demanding their investments back. Karpeles later said that 200,000 of the lost bitcoins had been recovered but that still leaves $241 million of the cryptocurrency, valued at today\'s market prices, unaccounted for.   Kraken said that it would now assist in the search with a Mt. Gox trustee and the tie-up had been approved by a Tokyo-based court on Wednesday. Kraken proudly stated that it was chosen due to its proven track record of stable exchange operation and reliable customer support.

However in a subsequent press conference with Powell, industry website Coindesk reported that he saw only a slim chance of his company actually uncovering the lost bitcoins.     "I wouldn\'t hold my breath," he said.

On Wednesday, he tweeted his frustration at four months of "disappointing" creditor meetings for Mt. Gox, but added that Kraken\'s announcement was an "interesting twist."    "(Very) interesting Kraken press (conference)," he said on the social media site.     "They are being given a lot of power. I upgrade my assessment from interesting twist to game changer."

First came Cyber Monday, a second bite at the apple from online retailers. Then there was the slow creep into Thanksgiving Day. Two years ago Bitcoin Black Friday made its debut, and it\'s a holiday tradition that\'s quickly gaining ground.   Bitcoin Black Friday had a moderately successful start, with just 20 merchants initially supporting the campaign. Throughout the day, though, more began to list deals on the site\u2014with the number climbing to 50 by the time the shopping day was through.    Last year, the number surged to 600 merchants, and sales hit the equivalent of $6 million. This year, said the event\'s founder, Jon Holmquist, 1,200 merchants are expected to take part, and it\'s looking to branch the customer base out beyond the circle of existing bitcoin users.    Read MoreOn a budget? Beware retail traps    "We have two things planned," he said. "First is the ability to instantly purchase bitcoin with your credit card: a small amount, like $25 worth. For most people, that\'s not too much of a risk. And we\'re also going to have a section [of the site] where you can purchase something for a small amount of money."   The response wasn\'t overwhelming, but it was enough to convince him to try. This year, Bitcoin Black Friday has grown to the point that Holmquist said he\'s had to bring on a small staff to help organize it for the past two months.   Last year, BitcoinBlackFriday.com\u2014the home site of the sale that lists the offers\u2014garnered 100,000 visitors, according to Bitpay. This year\'s traffic is likely to be significantly higher, as mainstream retailers, like Newegg, Overstock and TigerDirect, have begun accepting the digital currency, raising consumer awareness.   Read MoreBlack Friday isn\'t dead! Here\'s why    Among the companies expected to participate this year are Newegg; precious metals dealer Amagi Metals; domain registration site NameCheap; and gift card reseller Gyft. And that merchant count could easily exceed the estimated 1,200, as listing a deal is free to any company that accepts bitcoin payments.   "The big problem for us is that most merchants don\'t want to plan ahead," said Holmquist. "It\'s a lot of smaller merchants, so they put it off until the day of or the day before."  Meet the blockchain The technology behind bitcoin could be even more important than the cryptocurrency itself. One company that won\'t be participating, apparently, is Overstock. While it\'s arguably the largest company to accept bitcoin, a spokesperson said the company\'s Black Friday deals will be listed on its own site, though all can be paid for with the digital currency.  Read MoreThe magic that powers your cybershopping   Traditionally, Bitcoin Black Friday deals aren\'t revealed until the day after Thanksgiving. (Due to the smaller nature of the businesses that accept the currency, there\'s little worry of leaks, and the owners likely realize the deals they offer aren\'t likely to whip heads around quite as quickly as the doorbusters at traditional retailers.) This year, however, to build excitement and interest in the event, the list will post on the day before Thanksgiving, letting shoppers prepare accordingly.    Bitcoins have certainly seen a surge of interest in 2014, and investors in the digital currency have ridden a breathtaking roller coaster.     After topping $1,000 at the end of 2013, the value of a bitcoin started this year at more than $940, but that didn\'t last long. A plunge started in February, eventually bottoming out in April at $360. It surged again to $665 in early June but hasn\'t been able to hold that level, either. These days, it\'s hovering around $370.    One of the main causes for the instability was the collapse of the Japanese-based bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox, which once claimed it handled around 80 percent of all global dollar trades for bitcoin. The shutdown of that exchange resulted in 850,000 lost bitcoins and 127,000 empty-handed customers.    Despite these setbacks, though, there\'s still an active, enthusiastic community for the currency. Now merchants are hoping that enthusiasm can be converted into profits.

Just as we expect stock exchanges and banks to be regulated, so, too, should virtual currency exchanges and centralized companies that store large balances on behalf of consumers, be regulated. This should help prevent situations like the Mt. Gox implosion from occurring and may reduce the potential of fraud, theft and Ponzi schemes.     The recent BitLicense carve-outs for software developers and bitcoin miners seem to allow for a level of innovation free from regulation. So far, so good. At a glance, the New York Department of Financial Services seems to be on the right track. Providing a regulatory framework in which bitcoin exchanges, online wallets and merchant processing services can operate is an important step forward in the evolution of virtual currencies and legitimizes their use.  Read MorePolice forced to pay bitcoin ransom   However, when one digs deeper into the NFS BitLicense proposal, what we actually see is a regulatory framework that imposes unrealistic requirements on bitcoin users and merchants. You see, a very large part of the regulation deals with trying to remove one of the biggest benefits to society that bitcoin provides: anonymity. BitLicense, as written, forces merchants to collect names and addresses for the simplest of transactions. Can you imagine having to give your name and address at the drive through checkout just to buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin? That's what the proposal is trying to enforce.     So just why is the anonymity aspect such a benefit to society? Since 2013, hackers have stolen over 1 billion consumer records. The estimated cost of this data theft is a staggering $5 billion dollars a year, which inevitably gets passed down to consumers and merchants in the form of higher prices and fees.     There is a global data-security crisis. Indeed, a war is being waged \u2014 and that's making it harder and harder for the good guys to win. The hackers only have to succeed a small percentage of the time to make a very big dent on our society. As a result, we are in an era where securing personal information requires more and more complex security and surveillance, by merchants, banks and the government agencies.   Read MoreIs Apple Pay a bitcoin killer?   The system of credit-card processing introduced in the 1940s and 1950s, perfected in the 1970s and 1980s, was never designed for the 21st century, a century in which the Internet and the open-source community and the dark web accelerate technology innovation at a pace far more rapid than slow moving merchant and banking infrastructure can keep up with. To address this global data security crisis requires us to fundamentally re-think what it means for a consumer to spend money. As it stands today, a simple trip to the grocery store or buying gifts online at Christmas, subjects hundreds of millions of people to potential fraud, identity and credit-card theft. Crimes that may affect their credit record, their finances, indeed even their ability to work. Moreover, the current approach to addressing these problems, ring fencing, surveillance, detection and tracking is leading us as a society down a very slippery road. It's an approach that means everything we do, every dollar we spend, our location, everyone we talk to, it all needs to be monitored and tracked, relationships mapped, algorithms applied just to catch a very small number of bad actors causing a very large amount of damage.     Bitcoin solves these problems, because it does not require us to expose personal information just to go out to dinner or shop online. Every transaction is done with a bearer instrument that does not give the receiver any information that might be used or stolen to exact future payments, or perform any fraud. It's just like cash, only designed for the 21st century, designed for the world we live in now. It protects consumers from identity theft, fraud, and reduces the massive costs associated with processing transactions, opening up global economies and bringing massive new consumer markets into an integrated 21st century economy.  Read MoreWebcam hackers may be watching you   Unfortunately, the NFS BitLicense proposal explicitly strips consumers of these benefits, reducing consumer protection, since, as written, it requires bitcoin merchant-payment-processing companies to collect personal identifying information on every transaction, forcing merchants to collect it, thus destroying the huge opportunity that bitcoin presents to solve the global data-security crisis. Requiring this information on every transaction also makes transactions in bitcoin at your local retailer more complex than spending dollars or using a credit card, thus significantly impeding adoption and innovation.    Now, according to the NFS, these rules are introduced to protect us from terrorism and money laundering. But, in the world of fiat currencies these draconian AML and KYC regulations are normally reserved for large transactions in excess of $10,000. Not enforced on local shop owners selling pizzas and coffee. So unfortunately, the NFS BitLicense, as written, will greatly stunt bitcoin adoption by applying these rules broadly across all types of bitcoin transactions. It's an incorrect approach, very flawed, bad for business in New York, bad for Innovation in New York.     We are living in an exciting time. The pace of technology innovation and the globalization of our economies have huge potential to lift millions out of poverty and create new and exciting businesses. As a society we should foster that innovation and guide it so that it improves everyone's lives. Bitcoin and virtual currencies are here to stay. Much like electricity, this technology cannot be un-invented; the genie cannot be put back in the bottle. Bitcoin presents us with a huge opportunity as a society to change direction and move away from large centralized repositories of data and indeed control, to a more decentralized, lower impact approach. We should embrace this opportunity, because the current path of surveillance and tracking leads us to an Orwellian future that few would consciously choose.

Most people think of bitcoin, if they think about it at all, as a currency\u2014a means of digital exchange, or perhaps a speculative investment.     But forget everything you know, because the technology underlying bitcoin has the potential to be a much greater disruptive force than the cryptocurrency itself. Investors and technologists think the technology could replace huge aspects of the financial and insurance industries, and eventually even corporate management teams. In fact, big names like Google and IBM are reportedly already looking to invest in applications.    "Bitcoin is a token, a currency, but that\'s not all it is. That\'s the first of many many applications of this blockchain technology," said Jeff Garzik, one of five bitcoin core developers who have taken over maintenance of the technology from mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto. "[Currency] is not the killer app, it\'s just the first app."   How does it work? Meet the blockchain    The central insight behind bitcoin is its innovative blockchain\u2014a decentralized ledger that records every verified transaction. As it stands, proponents say it is the most secure record-keeping technology ever devised; each piece of information is stored on an immutable time-stamped list, which is then replicated on other servers across the globe.    This chain lives in its entirety on hundreds of machines around the world\u2014which helps ensure protection from corruption, technological or otherwise.    The term "blockchain" comes from the way information is stored: New transactions are stored on a "block" of data, and each block uses code to refer back to the preceding chunk of information\u2014thereby creating a chain.   Within the world of bitcoin, the blockchain acts as a "register of deeds," according to Garzik.   Read MoreIs Apple Pay a bitcoin killer?    "I don\'t store bitcoins, I store private keys that show I own bitcoins," he said. "I don\'t actually send bitcoins, I just change the name on the deed."    The blockchain is what gives bitcoin much of its appeal as a digital currency. Not only is it a global ledger that can confirm transactions in about 10 minutes, but it is also transparent and essentially unchangeable.   What\'s next? \'The Great Bitcoin 2.0 Race\'    Beyond just money, it\'s the next series of applications that Garzik calls "the great bitcoin 2.0 race."    Here\'s the basic idea: If the blockchain is able to securely contain the record of bitcoin transactions, then it should be able to hold any information with the same benefit. Also, the technology has been subjected to years of scrutiny by both enthusiasts and skeptics.    Which leads to so-called "smart contracts."   Here\'s an example: "Smart" loans could automatically adjust interest rates based on the financial performance of a borrower. The contract\'s code would need to include an automated observation of the key real world metrics\u2014like the rate at which the borrower is paying off the loan. And while most commercial loans already have these provisions, they have to be manually reported and monitored, and enforcement may fall to the discretion of individual agents, or the courts, so the application of this technology would create major efficiencies. Read More3 reasons Wall Street can\'t stay away from bitcoin    "The potential to greatly reduce or even eliminate the need for litigation and courts may be the most attractive feature of smart contracts," wrote Houman B. Shadab, co-director of New York Law School\'s Center for Business and Financial Law. In a recent conference abstract, he added that the technology "in principle removes the potential for parties to have a dispute."     A similar application would include "smart property," such as a digital asset (or one day even a real-world product like a car) that would turn off if the smart contract is ever breached. The car example, which was cited by several technologists, would likely require something akin to a self-driving feature to return it to a dealership.    To be sure, similar technologies exist in other forms (Oracle\'s PeopleSoft offers similar functionality, for example) but the blockchain innovation is that it allows the system to work without a trusted third party, theoretically cutting costs. Still, some have their doubts (warning: link has NSFW language) that the value of a decentralized trust-less ledger is all that useful.    Eventually, blockchain believers argue, smart contracts and property may replace company management to create a so-called decentralized autonomous organization\u2014artificial intelligence that can churn out smart contracts for dealing with human customers and employees.    At least some are dreaming even bigger, imagining that blockchain technology could completely change how we trade securities.  Thiel\'s bitcoin play Discussing the state of cybersecurity and his views of bitcoin, with Peter Thiel, author of "Zero to One."  The new Medici?    When online retailer Overstock began accepting bitcoins in January, many in the crypto community cheered the move as an important step in the currency\'s eventual universal acceptance. What most didn\'t realize, though, is that buying goods is not all Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne has in mind.    In an Oct. 6 announcement, Byrne revealed that he was planning a completely decentralized financial exchange using blockchain technology. Byrne, whose disdain of Wall Street is well documented, said he thinks this system will ultimately replace the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.    "We can bring a technology to market that does everything that Wall Street does," he said. "We will have made the biggest financial disruption in 800 years."  Harkening to the advent of modern banking in the Renaissance, Overstock has dubbed its project "Medici." Byrne said it may eventually replace retail as the primary focus of his company.   Read MoreCNBC Explains: How to mine bitcoins on your own    Marketing and bluster aside, Medici offers a clear value proposition: An equities or bonds exchange that cuts out the middlemen could offer greater efficiencies and cost-savings\u2014and allow for the layman to more readily participate in the market.      Although that task may seem daunting from a regulatory standpoint because it seeks to fully upend the current system, Byrne predicted he will be offering the first securities over his exchange in April as "early indications are actually quite positive" from regulators.    Any new exchange will be examined closely by the Securities and Exchange Commission to make sure it satisfies regulatory requirements for fair trading and adequate disclosure, Shadab said.    Also, the technological and regulatory hurdles facing Medici are not necessarily as trivial as Byrne thinks, said Charles Hoskinson, director of the Bitcoin Education Project, who has been involved with several blockchain projects.    "From a technology perspective I think it\'s dumb, and from a regulatory perspective I think it\'s very risky," Hoskinson said, explaining that a decentralized system will probably not offer adequate regulatory oversight, and that storing every transaction on a blockchain is a needlessly resource-intensive strategy.   Read MoreBitcoin needs more consumer protection    Byrne said he plans to issue a cryptosecurity called "O-coin" as the first on Medici. It would be "an approximation of the legal and common rights" of Overstock\'s common stock, but it would only be a small offering, he said.    While the technological infrastructure for many of these applications have not been built yet, groups with names like Counterparty and Ethereum are now working to do just that. And while many of these developers have converted into foundations for the spread of their protocols, their work has reportedly attracted interest from tech investors.    One source with knowledge of Ethereum\'s beginnings said that investment offers valued the project at about $500 million, and that Google Ventures was one of the interested parties. "That\'s a big number isn\'t it? That\'s an impressive number?" Ethereum Chief Communications Officer Stephan Tual said when asked about the figure, before adding that "I don\'t think the concept would work if we had accepted money."    Google Ventures did not respond to a request for comment.  Bitcoin: Expect chaos and drama Chief Scientist at Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Andresen, says there\'s still "value" in the bitcoin, but he expects to see "chaos" and "drama" as the bitcoin ecosystem works itself out.\n   Though major industry moves have yet to be announced, most in the space said they are confident that the "great bitcoin 2.0 race" is already fomenting significant corporate interest\u2014including from the likes of IBM, which has publicly announced it is exploring blockchain as a way to connect an "Internet of things."    Despite his anti-Wall Street rhetoric, Overstock\'s Byrne said major financial institutions are already exploring working with Medici. And a recent conference on blockchain tech regulation in New York featured a number of claims of major (but as-yet unannounced) partnerships.    "We\'ll be talking about the pre-blockchain and post-blockchain way of doing business," said Sam Yilmaz, managing partner at Decentralized Applications Fund, reflecting on some of the uses discussed at the conference.

"Bitcoin is a solution to a problem that doesn\'t exist, but the technology is utterly fascinating," said Jeffrey Robinson, author "BitCon: The Naked Truth about Bitcoin," which as the title suggests is a scathing indictment of the promises surrounding the digital currency.

If none of that made sense, here\'s the skinny: Someone posted a limit order to sell 30,000 bitcoins at $300 each\u2014well below the mid-300s price level the cryptocurrency had been trading at throughout the weekend. In the still-nascent market, an order of that size spooked the market, sending prices plummeting to levels not seen since last November. Since the incident, bitcoin has risen about 25 percent to $375, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin traders almost immediately named the seller "BearWhale," and the name proliferated quickly throughout social media.  And although he was eventually defeated\u2014the order was cleared after making a remarkable pattern in the bitcoin price chart (below)\u2014the community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts has begun to mythologize the incident, creating artwork and poetry in honor of the battle. Not only are they proud of successfully pushing against this perceived bearishness, but also no one can really figure out why the BearWhale emerged to begin with.   This chart, and the story behind it have inspired a host of online discussions (and T-shirts):        But many of the discussions on Reddit and elsewhere are simply trying to figure out why someone would seek to sell such a large sum of bitcoins below the current market value.    "It was a very immaturish way to liquidate that amount of coin," said Brendan O\'Connor, managing director for trading at SecondMarket.    Adding that the resulting market dip "ruined my Sunday," O\'Connor explained that as far as he and his team can tell, someone put the sell order on Bitstamp\u2014Europe\'s biggest bitcoin exchange\u2014and then removed it and replaced it several times. Ultimately, he said, the trader was able to sell roughly 26,000 bitcoins for about $7.8 million.  Read MoreBitcoin tanks, is Alibaba to blame?    "I have to tell you, it doesn\'t make any sense at all from a trading standpoint," O\'Connor said. "It\'s the last way in the world you would actually want to liquidate a large position like that."    Although the BearWhale may have left some money on the table, observers suggest that this may have been simply the easiest way to realize quick liquidity.    Tony Gallippi, co-founder and executive chairman of BitPay\u2014he also trades bitcoins as part of the company\'s instant exchange service\u2014said he thinks the strategy was "pretty well executed" because it caught people\'s attention and drew new or infrequent buyers into the marketplace. With the new buyers, the whole order was filled relatively quickly, and that may have been the point of the strategy, he said.  Read MoreBitcoin tumbles\u2014are investors losing faith?    Some, though, have alleged that something more nefarious is behind the market actions, with theories from law enforcement agencies liquidating their seized holdings to market manipulation on the part of one or more of the exchanges spreading online. These probably are not the case, though, experts said.    O\'Connor said he thinks the now-infamous trader was probably just someone from a computer science background who got into the digital currency early and did not have a strong background in trading. This assertion is backed by forensics on the specific coins for sale which showed that they had been stationary for over a year\u2014implying the BearWhale was an early adopter, Gallippi said.  Bitcoin calm before the storm: DFJ\'s Draper Discussing his bullish outlook on bitcoin, with Tim Draper, Draper Fisher Jurvetson managing director. Draper says as the Internet was to information, bitcoin will be to finance, commerce and banking. Even without the big sell limit, bitcoin\'s value has seen a steady degradation since early July when its price topped $630. Various explanations have been offered for the move, but one of the most common has been that the increased merchant adoption of the currency has put downward pressure on it.   The theory holds that merchants\u2014who almost always accept bitcoins as payment for products and services and then immediately exchange them back into local currencies\u2014are creating an excess of sellers in the marketplace, thereby adding to the fall in exchange value.    "More merchants want to take advantage of the purchasing power of the community, and the more merchants accept, the more bitcoins will be for sale," Euro Pacific Capital\'s Peter Schiff told CNBC in September. "(The market is) not going to be able to come up with enough new buyers."   Read MoreApple Pay won\'t bite into bitcoin: Winklevoss    This point of view has been expressed by Citi and other observers.    But Gallippi\u2014whose BitPay system enables businesses to accept bitcoins and then instantly exchange them for local currency\u2014disputed this theory. While it is true that these transactions are bringing more sellers to the market, he said, most people are only using bitcoins for goods and services when they see the price spiking.     So in effect, the increased adoption of bitcoin by merchants is putting a ceiling on the price, but not applying general downward pressure, Gallippi said.

CNBC explains bitcoin, a payment system that uses virtual money for online transactions. It\'s like cash for the internet transferred by a mobile app or computer program. The identities and transactions are kept completely anonymous. Bitcoin lost nearly a fifth of its value over the weekend, raising concerns that investors are losing faith in the cryptocurrency.   Prices fell to a year-to-date low of $290.83 on Sunday, down over 18 percent from early Saturday, according to bitcoin news blog CoinDesk. Analysts are citing a number of factors for the decline: bearish chart signals; ongoing regulatory concerns; large sell orders by some early adopters; and a shift in the supply/demand balance.  "The rumors are that for some time now there\'s been a lot of success in \'off ramp\' \u2013 but the onboarding process hasn\'t caught up as quickly," Hugh Madden, co-founder of Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange ANX, told CNBC, referring to the ability of holders to spend bitcoins.    Read MoreBitcoin: CNBC Explains   Recently, a number of high profile online merchants started accepting bitcoin payments including Dell, Overstock and Expedia. Online payment processing giant PayPal plans to allow bitcoin payments through integration with bitcoin payment processing companies Bitpay, Coinbase and GoCoin, three of the largest bitcoin payment processing companies.    "It\'s actually a lot harder to get bitcoins than it is to spend them and there have been some suggestions that that\'s caused a supply/demand imbalance\u2026 PayPal integration would also improve that onboarding process," Madden said.   Early adopters    Some of the heavier declines may have been triggered by larger sell orders by a small number of bitcoin investors, Madden said.  Why Paypal\'s move is great news for bitcoin Paypal\'s integration of bitcoin into its payment operations means the digital currency is moving towards mainstream acceptance, says David Shin, Founder of PayWise.  "The view is that some early adopters are making moves at the moment \u2013 and you can see that in all of the publicly available exchange trade data," he added.   Bitcoin was the center of a media frenzy last year after it rose 8,000 percent from January to early December. Prices halved soon after amid regulatory concerns.    The cryptocurrency has since fallen out of the spotlight, save for a brief flash crash in August, when prices fell 12 percent during one day, due to concerns about state-specific regulation in in New York. Prices are down 73 percent their all-time high of $1,147 hit on December 4, 2013.

The United States military is studying digital currencies like bitcoin to learn if they can be traced and to figure out how they are used by America\'s adversaries around the world.     CNBC has learned that the global policy counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation flew to Florida to meet with officials from U.S. Special Operations Command for a daylong discussion Monday on the role of so-called cryptocurrencies\u2014of which bitcoin  is the best known\u2014in illicit finance.     The first-of-its-kind discussion came just as U.S. warplanes began flying missions over Syria in President Barack Obama\'s effort to check the advance of the Islamic terror network ISIS. A key priority for the U.S. military is stopping the flow of money to ISIS fighters and blocking the network\'s ability to process profits from kidnapping, extortion and illicit oil sales.    The military\'s interest in virtual currency is part of an overall effort by special operations forces to understand how their enemies finance themselves, and what intelligence special operators can glean by following the illicit money.     "We\'re trying to do our best to understand the true scope of the threat that we are dealing with," said a defense official who attended the meeting. "We have to fully understand all of the components and functions of the adversary across the globe\u2014not just in Syria and Iraq\u2014and the manner in which those adversaries raise, hide and move money."  Defense officials said ISIS is part of a global dark network on the Internet that is involved in the use of virtual currency\u2014although ISIS itself is "principally funded through means other than virtual currency."    The invitation-only event, called simply the "Virtual Currency Workshop," was held at an office building in downtown Tampa near MacDill Air Force Base where Special Operations Command is based, and it included a meet-and-greet cocktail party at the Marriott Waterside Hotel & Marina on Sunday evening.  It was organized by a little-known but highly influential group called Business Executives for National Security, which facilitates connections between American business leaders and the U.S. military.    The group\'s members include a who\'s who of America\'s corporate and financial elite, according to its website, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, former AIG CEO Hank Greenberg and David Koch of Koch Industries.    Read MoreArab Bank verdict risks erosion of anti-terror controls -industry    "We sort of like to fly below the radar," said Susan Maybaumwisniewski, senior vice president for projects at Business Executives for National Security. She said her group has organized previous sessions for U.S. Special Operations Command, putting industry experts in front of American war fighters.  Previous topics have included capital markets and mobile banking. Maybaumwisniewski said the virtual currency event Monday was not specifically focused on ISIS, but rather a long-planned opportunity for the business community to brief the military on virtual currencies.     Among the roughly 100 attendees at the event, said several participants, were business executives and specialists in financial payment processing, experts in bitcoin operations, Silicon Valley executives, representatives from the U.S. Treasury and Department of Homeland Security, as well as members of the U.S. intelligence community.     A key question for the officers in the room: Can the U.S. military trace bitcoin? "That\'s a difficult question," said the defense official, "and one we\'re working through now."     One attendee characterized cryptocurrencies as "very dangerous stuff" for the U.S. military. "We were brought in [to Monday\'s meeting] to work on ways to meet the challenge," he said. "I don\'t want to say what they were."    Read MoreJury: Arab Bank liable in terror attacks    The meeting marked a stark culture clash between the transnational, distributed technology of bitcoin and the centralized command ethos of the U.S. military.     For the Bitcoin Foundation, which represents a broad array of libertarian technologists who can be skeptical of the U.S.   government, meeting face-to-face with the national security establishment carries certain risks.     "This is the first time I\'ve talked in an organized way with the U.S. military," said Jim Harper, global policy counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation. "The bitcoin community doesn\'t necessarily endorse U.S. foreign policy, and the bitcoin community doesn\'t necessarily endorse everything the U.S. intelligence community does." But, he said, "things that are morally wrong, bitcoin rejects."    And he said cooperation with the U.S. military may continue. "On the things that the bitcoin community agrees with, I think there\'s certainly a lot of willingness to work together. It\'s unserious to think that you shouldn\'t familiarize law enforcement and the military with bitcoin."     Harper said no one in the U.S. military at the event offered specific intelligence that ISIS is using bitcoin. And he said his message to the government is that bitcoin is an open, transparent, financial system. "Bitcoin runs on a transparent ledger system," he said. "The essence of the protocol is that it\'s a publicly run ledger system, contrary to the early vision of bitcoin as a magic cloak for evil behavior."     Pinguino Kolb, co-founder of the website Spelunk.in which tracks cryptocurrencies, said the digital currency community is largely skeptical of the U.S. government and of U.S. intelligence. News of a meeting between bitcoin advocates and the Special Operations Command may not be taken well in that community, she said. "A lot of people think, \'oh, my God, government\u2014scary," she said. "They wouldn\'t look at both sides of the story as much as they would kind of just freak out on Reddit."     Still, Kolb said the broader cryptocurrency community understands the tensions between security and freedom. "Nobody wants the bad guys to get a bunch of money," she said. "But they don\'t want to lose their freedoms, either." She added that U.S.   intelligence would do well to focus less on bitcoin and more on other alternative currencies that are more focused on anonymity, like Darkcoin, which Wired magazine called "the shadowy cousin of bitcoin."    For their part, the special operations officers said it\'s their job to dive into and understand new communities. "This was my first engagement with the Bitcoin Foundation," said the defense official. "I\'ve read Mao Tse Tung\'s book," he added. "We are fascinated by anything that interests our adversary."    Read MoreBitcoin needs better consumer protection, says industry exec    The military officials said they are mindful of the civil liberties concerns involved in monitoring private financial transactions on the Internet. "Anytime we come across information about a U.S. citizen, that information is to be disposed of if it is discovered," the official said. "Our purpose is never to disrupt legitimate businesses."    Participants in the event said they agreed to hold it under "Chatham House rules" that barred them from identifying other attendees or revealing what was said. But Maybaumwisniewski said attendees were mostly from government agencies and the military, as well as private sector experts. "We had bankers, we had most of the food chain for bitcoin in the room," she said. "The bitcoin people said this is a pretty visible process\u2014all of your trades are online."     Monday\'s virtual currency meeting coincided with a larger military-only series of meetings at MacDill Air Force Base on terror financing. That event, the Department of Defense\'s annual Threat Finance Working Group, brought together representatives from all of the U.S. military\'s combatant commands to focus on all the ways terror organizations and other entities raise and spend money.     The defense official\u2014who attended both events\u2014said military officers brought information learned about virtual currencies back to the larger group. "It\'s new to us," he said. "And it\'s gaining interest."

Touching as low as $381.17 earlier Friday, bitcoin is trading at a far cry from its position around $513 less than a month ago or nearly $650 in July. And while the cryptocurrency has been languishing for several weeks, it\'s seen an increasing slide from Monday\'s open around $470.   Members of the bitcoin community are pointing fingers at the e-commerce giant\'s IPO, suggesting that tech-minded China-centric money is being pulled out of the currency in order to get into Alibaba\'s first day of trading.        Writing for Bitcoin Magazine, Sembro Development President Ian Worrall said his firm believes "that the Chinese Bitcoin holders began dumping their holdings earlier this week to free up capital to invest in Alibaba when it goes public."    Worrall told CNBC this assessment is based on his software firm\'s finding that much of the bitcoin trade volume is coming from China during this selloff. In fact, Worrall said, the Chinese exchanges are seeing 52 percent more volume compared to their American counterparts over the last month.    Alibaba seemed the most likely explanation of the price decrease, Worrall said, as there have not been any major recent announcements related to the cryptocurrency, and "normally when there\'s a change this large it\'s because of some government regulation."   Euro Pacific Capital\'s Peter Schiff disputed this theory, telling CNBC "that\'s just grasping at straws."   Read More Apple Pay won\'t bite into bitcoin: Winklevoss    "They\'re just trying to find some excuse [for bitcoin\'s slide]," Schiff said. "I just can\'t think there are that many bitcoin guys that are going to jump into Alibaba."    Raffael Danielli, quantitative analysis blogger behind Matlab Trading, said an Alibaba-influenced selloff could have been possible, but the current timetable does not make sense.    "Selling your Bitcoins yesterday (and during the night) will only put USD into your Bitcoin exchange account. From there you have to still transfer it to your stock broker which usually takes a couple of days," he wrote in an email to CNBC. "In other words: if (!) people sold Bitcoins yesterday to buy into Alibaba then they are a bit late to the party."    Danielli suggested instead that the bitcoin downtrend may be because of several factors, including merchants\' increasing adoption of the currency. When someone uses bitcoin to pay for a product, the merchant typically converts it immediately back into U.S. dollars, which means that the market is increasingly flooded with sellers.   Read More3 reasons Wall Street can\'t stay away from bitcoin    For his part, Schiff pointed to a weak technical profile for the cryptocurrency that has seen an overall downtrend since its peak in December.    And while bitcoin proponents often point to the volatility as a natural part of the currency\'s marketplace\u2014there were similar fits and starts when it was worth less than $100\u2014Schiff said that this time around is different.

This month, Bank of England (BoE) weighed into the debate, publishing a major new piece of research. Ever since academics and experts have been poring over the report, especially its warning that cryptocurrencies could pose a threat to financial stability.   The BoE pays particular attention to bitcoin. Like other virtual currencies, it allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services and can be created by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.    While it believes bitcoin doesn\'t currently pose a material risk, mainly due to its limited use, the bank warns that it is possible to conceive the risks that may develop over time as it gains in popularity and if no controls are in place.    Read More Bank of England: Bitcoin could transform stock markets   CNBC highlights the three key areas that the BoE believes could pose a threat with well-known voices in the industry adding to the argument.   Crash contagion   The BoE suggests that "marked increases" in price could mean that a price crash might have greater impact. A chart showing the price of bitcoin since its inception in 2010 makes for some scary reading. Critics have likened it to the Dutch "tulip fever" of 17th century but advocates expect this to iron itself out as liquidity and volume increase over time.   "Anyone who has been following bitcoin would probably agree with the BoE that a future bitcoin price crash is not only conceivable but probable," Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, told CNBC via email.   Read MoreWhat is bitcoin?   "A more interesting bitcoin price observation, which the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street fails to mention, is that the severity of bitcoin price crashes appears to be lessening."   But the BoE concedes that a crash would be fairly limited to the holders of the digital currency, adding that it would only really cause genuine fear if derivatives came into play or "systemically important" financial institutions had an unhedged position. In February this year,  Wall Street\'s Fortress Investment Group reported a $3.7 million in unrealized losses on bitcoin during the previous year. While this might not be a significant institution like the BoE details, it shows the willingness for some players to take major positions on the cryptocurrency.   Zennon Kapron, the managing director of financial consulting and research firm Kapron Asia believes that derivatives based on bitcoin\'s open source technology could potentially provide more clarity than traditional financial derivatives as each underlying risk in each asset could be more easily broken down to its individual parts.   System-wide fraud   The U.K.\'s central bank is also concerned that system-wide fraud could appear with one or more miners taking control of payments by gaining a majority holding of the currency. This is known as the "51 percent attack" issue, and is a well-known problem in the bitcoin community, according to Bobby Lee, the CEO of prominent Chinese bitcoin exchange BTC China.   Read MoreIs Apple Pay a bitcoin killer?  BoE taking bitcoin seriously: Chief Cashier Victoria Cleland, chief cashier and director of banknotes at the Bank of England, says the central bank is taking bitcoin seriously but does not see it as a threat to cash.   "The consensus is that it would not make economic sense to conduct fraud using a 51 percent attack," Lee told CNBC via email.       Jon Matonis, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, which aims to promote and protect the cryptocurrency, explains that as bitcoin miners are incentivized then they would participate honestly rather than manipulate a system which would only grant "limited" capabilities. He adds that it would be disruptive but not fatal and there would be ways for the bitcoin community to rapidly correct the issue within a short space of time.  Read MoreBitcoin key to future of online payments: EBay CEO    "It\'s a lot of money to spend for approx 10 minutes of temporary and potentially limited \'fraud\'," he told CNBC.   Fractional reserve banking    This is already a familiar banking practice -- whereby a lender only holds reserves to satisfy the demands for withdrawals and are less than the amount of total customer deposits. But used in the world of bitcoin, this could put national financial stability at risk if unregulated, according to the Bank of England, due to the possibility of what it describes as "bank runs."    BTC China\'s Bobby Lee believes that this is indeed a possibility if these institutions misbehave but advocates "moderate and appropriate" regulation which should help consumer protection, and minimize fraud and bad behavior.    Meanwhile, Matonis says that it is debateable whether fractional reserve banking is even a possible with cryptocurrencies. The transparency of the technology behind bitcoin would mean that customers would be aware of overissuance, he said.

The technology behind digital currency bitcoin could have far-reaching implications and the potential to reshape the financial industry, according to a new report by the Bank of England (BoE).   The reason for the BoE\'s excitement? Virtual currencies - most notably bitcoin - have at their heart a publicly distributed ledger system called the "block chain" that makes sure all transactions are verified in a transparent, decentralized and secure fashion without imposing hefty transaction fees. This system is a "genuine technological innovation", according to a new report by the U.K.\'s central bank, which details the negative and positive aspects of cryptocurrencies.   "The key innovation of digital currencies is the \'distributed ledger\' technology that allows a payment system to operate in an entirely decentralized way, with no intermediaries such as banks," the BoE\'s quarterly report, released on Thursday afternoon, said.

The BoE says that, since the majority of financial assets such as shares or bonds already exist only as digital records, distributed ledgers could possibly transform the financial system.

Among these risks, it says that the price of digital currencies can be very volatile and that a price crash is not inconceivable. If marked increases in prices do occur, it said that it would be possible that a crash might have implications for U.K. financial stability, it said, especially with unhedged exposures by important financial institutions and if investors became leveraged via derivative contracts.    It also warned on the possibility of system-wide fraud with the potential for a single miner, or coalition of miners, to come under control of which payments were permitted. Additionally, it believes that if digital payments become more popular within a small group of the population then it could lead to economic fragmentation and affect the Bank\'s ability to influence demand with monetary policy.

"Such an outcome is extremely unlikely given the current impediments to the widespread adoption of current digital currency schemes imposed by their designs," it said, adding that it believes transaction fees for bitcoin would eventually need to rise significantly, as usage increases.    "It is much more likely that, if further adopted, digital currencies will be used in a limited fashion alongside traditional currencies," it concluded.

How bitcoin can change the world Could bitcoin be a safe haven for deprecating currencies in the emerging world? Wences Casares, Xapo founder and CEO, shares his thoughts on the legitimacy of the currency. Extremely high volatility, the difficulty of buying and selling the currency and scandals such as the collapse earlier this year of Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox have all added to the controversy surrounding the online currency. However, Bitcoin has become more stable in recent months and some of Silicon Valley\'s leading entrepreneurs and investors have rushed to become involved, seeing it as a way to disrupt the banking industry.   The Coinbase service will be available in most of the euro zone,including France, Spain and Italy. Extra regulations in Germany, where Bitcoin is defined as a type of investment requiring a special licence, means users there will not be able to use the service, Mr Ehrsam said. He added that the company has talked to banks in the UK about accepting sterling payments.    Bitcoin has attracted initial interest from technology early-adopters, libertarians wanting to support a currency outside government control and from speculators drawn by its wild price swings. Companies such as Coinbase hope to capitalize on a broadening interest as mainstream consumers start to see it as an investment vehicle and means of payment that bypasses existing channels.

Like other Bitcoin companies, it is counting on rising consumer interest to encourage merchants to accept the currency which would then encourage more people to use it for transactions rather than simply hoarding it.    Europe is "maybe eight months behind the US" in terms of Bitcoin adoption, making this the moment at which wider use could start to take off, Mr Ehrsam said. US companies that have said they will accept payments in Bitcoin include online retailer Overstock, PC maker Dell and travel company Expedia.    Among likely first users of the European service were software developers in eastern Europe who are paid Bitcoin in return for work they do for US employers, but who did not have an easy way to hold the currency or make payments with it, Mr Ehrsam said.

The launch could not have come at a better time, as consumers have been inundated with security breaches and are likely ready to make a change.      The concept of a "tokenization" or a one-time card number that does not transmit personal data is a similar concept to the Bitcoin blockchain.  Certainly technology purists will argue that the blockchain technology at the heart of Bitcoin is superior, but to the consumer, the difference is indistinguishable.  Read MoreApple\'s new iPhones, payments and watch   Even if the consumer demands a superior technology, Apple\'s ability to partner with Visa, MasterCard and American Express in addition to retailers like McDonalds, Whole Foods and Disney provides a formidable barrier to entry. Moreover, Apple can crowdsource the next "killer app" with its development ecosystem.  But does this mean Bitcoin is dead?     No.    The Apple ecosystem is a closed system that does a tremendous job at retaining customers but leaves it vulnerable to the innovation of open source projects.  This is a flaw that Google\'s Android has exploited brilliantly and profitably.  In addition, Apple\'s plan to layer another fee on top of an already expensive payment network is an opportunity for digital currencies.  Offering a product that is open source and virtually free is how Android became the top mobile operating system in the world. Digital currencies should borrow from Google\'s playbook in order to compete with Apple.  The open-source nature of digital currencies gives them a major competitive edge as the best technology can be immediately integrated without the need to navigate a corporate culture. This gives digital currencies a first mover advantage as consumers begin to embrace a digital payment network.  Android was able to gain market share by offering apps that Apple had yet to approve and therefore opened itself to the early adoption of game changing tech.  Read MoreApple shares flat, stock downgraded   Probably Apple\'s biggest competitive advantage is its proven ability to change consumer behavior.  Before iTunes, consumers where quite content buying an entire album, while sharing single songs was in the realm of a few technology enthusiasts using a thing called Napster.  As one of the first successful peer-to-peer technologies, Napster had the potential to change the world of music but it lacked the resources to engage the industry in battle. Apple recognized the revolutionary potential of Napster and designed a system that was easy for the non-tech savvy user.  Moreover, it was able to use its considerable resources to convince the music industry to embrace the inevitable change.  The technology giant appears to employing a similar strategy with Apple Pay.      The explosion of interest in Bitcoin has shown that consumers are open to changing behavior as related to payment systems.  The idea of a peer-to-peer network that provides a secure method to exchange value has been enthusiastically embraced by the tech community and a few financial pseudo-nerds like me.  The promise of Apple Pay for the digital currency community is that Apple has designed a user friendly way to pay for items digitally.  Apple Pay has the potential to change the decade old habit of reaching for a plastic card encased in a leather wallet in order to digitally transmit financial information.        This behavior change should be embraced by the digital-currency community.    Once consumers break the need for a tactile payment method, it will be easier to accept new methods of exchange.  When consumers realize how easy it is to pay digitally they will begin to ask for a cheaper way to do so.  Apple Pay introduces the consumer to the idea of tokenization and once comfortable, the consumer will likely demand more, more, more.  This is the opportunity that digital currencies must embrace.  Napster led to iTunes which changed the way we all buy music; Bitcoin has led to Apple Pay which will change the way we all buy "things."  Read More3 reasons Wall Street can\'t stay away from bitcoin   The announcement of a mobile-payment system by Apple was an evolutionary step. The infrastructure it runs on is old technology linked to a centralized financial system. Tokenization is a time-tested encryption method of "one-time use-card numbers" that has been used prior to Apple Pay. However, Apple\'s ability to put a user-friendly face on existing technology should not be underestimated.  The decentralized Bitcoin network is more efficient, cheaper and secure than Apple Pay and eventually should be embraced by the consumer. However, just like digital music needed the evolutionary step from Napster to iTunes, so, too, do digital currencies need this move by Apple.

The three companies are wary of the idea that a license would allow the New York State\'s Department of Financial Services access to information from both the companies and their affiliates. A license holder\'s affiliates should be allowed to only disclose relevant information to the authorities, the letter stated.   They also see problems regarding the proposed requirement that licensed firms need to perform "enhanced" customer checks on non-U.S. residents.

The federal agency on Monday issued new warnings about the risks of using the nascent virtual currency, which is still subject to relatively loose regulation and is not backed by any central authority. The CFPB is urging consumers to be wary of wide fluctuations in bitcoin exchange rates, potential hacking, theft and stolen funds.     "Virtual currencies are not backed by any government or central bank, and at this point consumers are stepping into the Wild West when they engage in the market," CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement.

At 32, he is now the Republican candidate for governor of New Hampshire\u2014the youngest gubernatorial candidate in state history\u2014and the first to accept bitcoin donations.     In May, a unanimous vote by the Federal Election Commission made it legal for bitcoin donations to be deposited into official campaign accounts. Donations are capped at $100 per person, per cycle.    "Every candidate has their base and their network ... I think by nature the currency trends significantly young and tech-savvy, so that\'s my base," Hemingway said. "My friends use bitcoin, their friends use bitcoin ... it\'s a part of a community."     About 20 percent of Hemingway\'s donations so far have come from bitcoins. If elected, he hopes to make New Hampshire the first state to accept bitcoin as payment for state taxes and fees.

The description on his donation page reads, "I am proud to be one of the first members of Congress to promote personal financial freedom by accepting a digital currency for contributions."    Polis said his campaign was "eagerly awaiting" the FEC\'s decision on bitcoin donations in May. He has raised approximately $2,000 in bitcoins from more than 60 donors.    Christina Gagnier, Democratic candidate for the 35th congressional district in California, said her use of bitcoins has caught the attention of individuals who may not have been interested in her campaign otherwise.     "So far, it\'s not a huge percentage (of donations)," she said. "But I have engaged donors I haven\'t engaged before."   Read MoreTime for digital currencies to grow up    Bitcoin is converted into cash immediately upon donation to avoid volatility in the coin\'s value. It is created by online users who solve complicated mathematical puzzles and stored in digital "wallets."    Because this is the first election cycle in which virtual currency has been used, experts say there is no official data on how much bitcoin has been brought in during this election cycle so far.     "The $100 cap is an issue, and I wonder if the FEC will revisit that," Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said. "I expect to see people maxing out that $100 donation."    Both PACs and individual candidates are taking advantage of the new rules on virtual currency.

"The bitcoin demographic is younger, more tech-oriented, probably more male-heavy."     Harper said bitcoin donations are likely to increase as the coin\'s younger demographic becomes more politically engaged.    "Younger people aren\'t that active in politics in general, so as these people grow older, you may see more use," he said.

In a speech at London\'s Canary Wharf in the east of London, U.K. Finance Minister George Osborne said the government had begun exploring the potential of virtual currencies and digital money, such as bitcoin.    "These alternative payment systems are popular because they are quick, cheap, and convenient \u2013 and I want to see whether we can make more use of them for the benefit of the U.K. economy and British consumers. I also want to be alert to the risks that accompany any new technology," he said.    Osborne was speaking at the launch of Innovate Finance, a new industry body for the "fintech" - or financial technology - industry, which covers technology including digital currencies, mobile banking apps, crowdfunding platforms and more. "With the right backing from government, I believe we can make London the fintech capital of the world," he added.  Read MoreBitRegulation! NY plans new rules for virtual currencies   Bitcoin is a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining. Some 13 million bitcoins are believed to be in circulation, with a cap of 21 million \u2014 meaning no more bitcoins can be created after that point.    The digital currency has sparked interest by venture capitalists on both sides of the Atlantic but has also run into regulatory issues in many countries.    James Smith, CEO and co-founder of digital currency storage company Elliptic, said he welcomed a move towards regulation as it would likely reassure potential customers \u2013 such as hedge funds and big banks \u2013 about putting their money into bitcoin.    "A lot of the bigger financial players, such as banks, they\'ve had all sorts of fines for AML (anti-money laundering) problems, and bitcoin looks a lot like cash so they\'re very wary of touching it because they don\'t want to fall into the same traps," he told CNBC.    "They feel a lot more comfortable with digital currencies when they know what the government\'s stance is on it."   Read MoreLondon bank scandals aid \'fintech\' dominance    Bitcoin\'s price volatility has led it to be heavily criticized. The currency first first received international media attention in April 2013 which culminated in its price rallying over $100. Later in the year a regulatory meeting on Capitol Hill helped it surge above $1,000.     However, with Chinese authorities tightening the rules on bitcoin and a Japanese exchange filing for bankruptcy protection, investors decided to cash in on their holdings. The price has since remained steady at around $600 with little news flow this summer. The volume of trades has also reduced, according to data from bitcoincharts.com.

Bitcoin transactions were initially taxed with a 20 percent charge in the U.K., but the country\'s tax authority announced it was scrapping this added cost back in March.     Greg Jarret, CEO of Bitcoin Superfund, a U.K.-based bitcoin investment vehicle, said there was the potential for Britain to become the world\'s bitcoin hub, but there were some stumbling blocks.     "Whether or not there\'s enough investment (in the U.K.), and whether we can outpace Silicon Valley in terms of VC (venture capital) money - that could be challenging," he told CNBC.

On July 17, New York State\'s Department of Financial Services proposed issuing a "BitLicense" that would protect consumers, prevent money laundering and enforce cyber security.    Elliptic\'s James Smith, however, described New York\'s measures as "very heavy handed" and said Britain\'s reaction was preferable.    "They\'re in danger of stamping out the business before it even takes off. The U.K. has \u2013 and Europe in general \u2013 have taken a stand-back-and-see-what-happens approach," he said.

Jon Matonis, an executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, which is a lobby group for the technology, has previously written about his concerns on regulation.       Writing on bitcoin news website Coindesk, he said that if new regulation meant that if users were required to give away internet protocol addresses - and therefore their locations - then bitcoins in that regulated jurisdiction could start trading at a discount price.  Bitcoin Superfund\'s Jarret, however, argued that regulation was necessary for digital currencies to really take off.   "The reality is there are a lot of great features in bitcoin and digital currencies in general for society," he said.

For digital currencies to fulfill the promise of adulthood they need some rules to live by, a protocol if you will.      The blockchain is the central ledger at the heart of all digital currencies and for the first time in human history, it allows individuals to send secure information over an unsecured network without a trusted third party.  The most obvious use for this technology is for financial transactions and conveniently the centralized financial-services industry is ripe for disintermediation. Since the founding of the Bank of England in 1694, our financial system has consisted of middlemen orbiting the central banks. This web was necessary to ensure the safe transfer of value between two parties who have no way of trusting each other. The trusted third party, or middleman, performed an essential function by verifying the legitimacy of financial transaction and transferring the value.    Read MoreBitregulation! NY plans new rules for virtual currencies When Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin in 2009, it removed a wide swath of middlemen, allowing for the direct transfer between individuals. However, digital currencies and the blockchain are more than just a medium of exchange, they represent a secure database open to anyone who has an Internet connection.  The Internet opened an unprecedented amount of information to society, but it lacked a mechanism to verify the information.  The blockchain technology is the mechanism by which any piece of information can be traced back to its source by everyone.  This technology is too important to lurk in the shadows.  Read MoreHow bitcoin could stop insider trading The New York State Department of Financial Services took the first step toward developing these rules this week, with the announcement of a BitLicense.  Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky has taken the lead in regulating digital currency businesses with the goal of protecting consumers while fostering innovation.  This was the right move at the right time. Recent cyber-attacks on major digital-currency exchanges have threatened to derail the growth of the blockchain technology.   These cyber-attacks have prompted me to establish a protocol for my digital  currency, Nautiluscoin, not just for cyber threats but also for the growth of the Nautiluscoin economy.  Moreover, many venture capitalists have been waiting for regulatory clarity to fund digital currency start-ups.  The decision by the New York DFS will likely be mimicked across all 50 states and opens the door for venture capital to fund innovations that will provide long lasting societal benefits.  The Internet began as a way to send files between computers and has flourished into a technology that allows doctors to remotely perform lifesaving surgeries.  With the regulatory picture in focus, the journey into adulthood for digital currencies can begin.   Creating a digital currency "Fast Money" trader Brian Kelly ventures into the digital currency world and walks through the steps of making his very own cryptocoin from scratch.  There are two major challenges for any regulation of digital currencies: enforcement and fostering innovation.  The strength of digital currencies is that they exist on millions of computers distributed across local and international borders. This distribution presents a challenge for regulators since enforcement across local and international borders is virtually impossible. Ideally, regulations will be light-handed enough to encourage those in the digital currency space to voluntarily submit to regulation. The BitLicense needs to be a stamp of legitimacy that is sought after by those operators with the most integrity.  Moreover, the critics of regulation will surely point toward the potential for increased costs.  This criticism is not without merit and is why it is critical for the New York DFS to honor its commitment to not stifle innovation.  Light-handed regulation to protect consumers and allow more people to experience the benefits of digital currencies is a welcome addition to the ecosystem.    Regulation of digital currencies may appear to be anathema to those who subscribe to the purest form of Nakamoto\'s open-source creation.  The open-source nature of digital currencies provides a built-in self-regulatory mechanism, but that mechanism does not protect against human greed. For digital currencies to grow up, they need a set of rules that allows for entrepreneurship while encouraging and protecting new users.  Regulation done correctly can not only expand the user base, but also implicitly gives digital currencies legitimacy.  Over the next 45 days, the digital-currency community will have an opportunity to opine on the proposed rules.  To be sure, this will not be without growing pains, but the BitLicense has the potential to be digital currencies\' gateway to adulthood.

The price of bitcoin on exchanges where it is traded has fluctuated, sometimes dramatically. Overall, though, Draper is confident the currency will trend upward; there is a limited amount of bitcoin and people are using it more and more, he said.    But the money does not lie in mining the currency, which is done with powerful computers which crack code problems to free up bitcoins.

So how should the average investor navigate the changing landscape? Very carefully.  "If the individual investor has a high risk tolerance, yes, they could invest," said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx. "But it\'s an amazingly risky investment and borders on a purely speculative punt." There are hundreds of online currencies out there\u2014327, according to the website Coinmarketcap.com. The best known among them is bitcoin. The creation of an unknown programmer or group of programmers, bitcoin grabbed headlines last year largely because it rose more than 6,200 percent before falling again\u2014it has recently hovered around $600. The wealth created by bitcoin has prompted firms ranging from Overstock.com to Dish Network and Expedia  to start accepting bitcoin payments. It has also spawned hundreds of new businesses looking to cash in on the digital currency craze. For investors looking to cash in, investments can be made in three primary ways: in the companies building businesses in the emerging space; buying the computer-generated currencies outright; or researching the investment funds being created to hold digital currencies.   For a direct investment in a digital currency, ConvergEx\'s Colas said investors should look for two traits: longevity and durability.  "I\'d want to see any online currency last for two years without breaking down" before making any investment, Colas said. Read More4 ways you can use your money to help end Wall Street Two other critical mileposts: regulation and adoption. Regulation will grant legitimacy to a digital currency and pave the way for greater adoption by consumers and businesses.  "I believe digital currency is now a new asset class and will end up as a core part of an investor\'s portfolio," said Barry Silbert, founder of SecondMarket, an exchange for private investments, and creator of the private Bitcoin Investment Trust.   Silbert cautioned investors that "the vast majority of these currencies will never gain traction. A lot of them are pump-and-dump-type schemes." Silbert is betting that bitcoin will emerge the winner in the digital currency space. He cited two reasons: Biticoin is the first digital currency to gain relatively broad acceptance, reflected in a market cap of $8.1 billion. That dwarfs its nearest competitor, Litecoin, with a market cap of $313 million. Second, bitcoin\'s core development team is constantly upgrading the bitcoin protocol, allowing for the addition of new features that Silbert said give it a competitive advantage.  "I give everyone the same advice," Silbert said.  "A purchase or investment in bitcoin is an investment in this entire revolution, so buying the currency itself is kind of like making an index play. So if the entire industry succeeds or fails, the price of bitcoin will reflect it."  Not everyone who is interested in bitcoin is interested in the digital currency as an investment. Internet entrepreneur Brad Templeton, who also is a director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, finds the technology underpinning digital currencies "exciting" but would not buy the currencies themselves.  "Their value is largely speculative. It\'s lesser fools making money from lesser fools," said Templeton. "I would tell them (investors) don\'t invest in bitcoin but to invest in the companies that are building on the technology." Read MoreMeet the CNBC Disruptor 50 Templeton believes the big challenge with bitcoin as a currency is that there is nothing backing it other than supply and demand. Bitcoin\'s supply is determined by its computer code, not by a central bank. Libertarian advocates hail this feature because it means the currency is free of any manipulation by a central bank or government. Templeton said this also makes it much harder to determine what bitcoin\'s stable value would be, and stability is critical to achieving wider acceptance. Coinbase co-founder\'s bold bitcoin prediction Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of payments processor Coinbase, sees more big retailers in the next few months deciding to accept bitcoin.   Templeton said the bitcoin protocol holds great potential to revolutionize financial services. He compares it to the Internet, a very simple and stupid program that allows innovators to create very smart applications to layer on top of it. Bitcoin is similar to the Internet and will allow programmers to create new applications for an industry that is resistant to change.    "In the current financial system, it is very hard to come up with new things," Templeton said, because getting a new idea up the corporate ladder and then past regulators can be too time consuming.        That\'s part of the bitcoin excitement: It\'s a tool for innovation without having to go through an entrenched system.    "It\'s a ledger that everyone can trust," Templeton said.     Read MoreHave an investing idea? Build your own ETF    Right now people are using bitcoin to make direct payments from one wallet to another, payments that are verified by a community of bitcoin miners, or computers that track each and every bitcoin transaction. Templeton expects bitcoin to be used for more than financial transactions in the future. Bitcoin will likely be used to transfer "smart contracts," including wills and deeds to properties directly between two parties without a middleman.     This may be years away. In the interim, Templeton said an investor\'s best bet would be to put money into companies that are focused on making the bitcoin ecosphere more secure and less vulnerable to theft and hacking, or to invest in firms that are creating applications that make it easier to store, buy and pay with bitcoin, such as 2014 CNBC Disruptor No. 35 Coinbase.    Unfortunately, investing in these firms is no easy task. Most of the companies are being funded by venture capital firms,   and an individual would have to be an accredited investor to gain access to these firms. To be considered an accredited investor, a person needs to have a net worth of more than a million dollars, excluding their primary residence. A barrier to entry in the digital space that the average retail investor may not be able to clear.

Silbert\'s firm already has partnered with Fidelity Investments so that Fidelity\'s customers can invest funds from their self-directed IRAs in SecondMarket\'s Bitcoin Investment Trust.    Silbert, who is a bitcoin investor, said there are essentially five phases to the digital revolution in currency.    The first phase was in 2008 when value started being associated with the digital currency. The second, "early adopter" phase began in 2011. Businesses began developing around its infrastructure\u2014including mining operations, merchant processing and exchanges.     We are currently in stage three, Silbert said, which is the capital phase. This phase started in 2013, when venture capital money started pouring into bitcoin start-ups.

"Firms are going to start trading it and investing in it and then that will eventually lead to phase five, which is mass consumer adoption," Silbert said.     That last phase will likely begin in 12 to 24 months, he said.     "Phase five is not possible until all the pieces of the puzzle have been funded and we have these fantastic products that make it easier to buy and use bitcoin," he said. "So the Wall Street money will likely kick off stage five."    A growing number of retailers in the U.S. and around the world are already embracing bitcoin as a form of payment. Over 60,000 businesses in the U.S. currently take bitcoin, and that number is only going to grow because the transaction costs are cheaper, Silbert said.

In the last month alone, bitcoin\'s price is up more than 40 percent; gold is down more than 2 percent.    While bitcoin\'s moves have certainly been more pronounced, the divergence between the two is unmistakable.

"Many hard-currency loyalists who sought refuge to the safety of gold out of protest against central banks\' erosion of currency value are now fleeing to bitcoin," Ashraf Laidi wrote in a recent client note.    "Bitcoin\'s base of support comes from tech-savvy younger people who trust technology over old school constructs like central banks or physical representations of value such as gold," said Nick Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex and the first strategist on Wall Street to write about bitcoin.   Although bitcoin enthusiasts may share their libertarian ideals with gold bugs and gold buyers, Colas said, demand for the two assets are coming from different places.    "The central problem is that the two assets tend to appeal to different constituencies\u2026For gold, the marginal buyer is either someone in emerging markets like India or China that has a long-standing respect for the longevity of gold as a store of value," Colas said.

Dish Network became the latest and largest company to accept bitcoin for payment, further cementing the digital currency\'s role as a medium of exchange.

"Bitcoin has its own ecosystem...(and) is light years ahead of the other (payment) networks."   Bitcoin is a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services.

While Klein admits that it took a while for him to take the plunge in the world of cryptocurrencies, Index Ventures, the venture capital company he has recently joined as a partner, has already taken its first tentative step.

Retailers, including Lord & Taylor, Overstock and TigerDirect, are syncing operations to make it easier for consumers with digital wallets to transact business with the cryptocurrency. The trend has venture capitalists  bullish on bitcoin. Already, San Francisco Bay-area bitcoin start-ups have received more than $200 million in VC funding, and the number continues to grow. Why is this happening? There are three aspects to bitcoin that have investors particularly excited today, and it all begins very simply with speculation of the cryptocurrency\'s value.     Mining pools, such as the heavily funded super-secret 21E6 in San Francisco, are apparently going long on bitcoin by mining as many bitcoins as they can, making the bet that its value will exceed mining costs. 21E6 has raised at least $5 million in venture funding.   Another bitcoin start-up getting big dollars is Palo Alto, California-based Vaurum, which recently announced seed funding of $4 million from Battery Ventures, Tim Draper, RRE Ventures and Steve Case. Vaurum runs an exchange that facilitates over-the-counter bitcoin trading for institutional traders.    Read MoreCNBC Explains: How to mine bitcoins on your own  .    Recently funded LedgerX claims they are building the "the first regulated, compliant derivatives exchange" for cryptocurrencies. Little else is known about this secretive start-up except that it already has more than a dozen investors, according to their AngelList page.    The second aspect of bitcoin that is exciting the venture capital community is the idea of consumers using the currency as a means of payment. Well-funded start-ups, such as BitPay, Coinbase and SnapCard, are trying to make bitcoin payments and purchases easy for the masses\u2014both online and at brick-and-mortars.    Digital currency payment start-ups is where a lot of VC dollars are being funneled. BitPay recently closed a large round of funding led by Index Ventures. Coinbase may very well be the top-funded bitcoin start-up, with more than $30 million in venture funding to date.     SnapCard is a product of Boost, a San Mateo, California-based incubator of start-ups run by Adam Draper, son of well-known VC Tim Draper. The bitcoin payment company made waves earlier this year by announcing that consumers using SnapCard could pay taxes with bitcoin.    BitPay has more than 30,000 enabled merchants in its network, with about 10 percent of those actively executing a bitcoin-based purchase in any given month. According to the start-up\'s co-founder, Stephen Pair, there is a direct correlation between price rises in bitcoin and the transaction volume among merchants that accept it. As the digital currency\'s price remains relatively volatile, that may not bode well for the short-term prospects of their merchants in increasing the volume of consumer bitcoin transactions. BitPay also believes that, ultimately, business-to-business transactions via the currency will be a much larger market for them versus consumer transactions. Given the large cost of international wires and currency exchange, they may be right.    All this speculation in this new form of currency has led to the problem of how consumers manage their bitcoin holdings. I spoke with one investor, who told me he has dozens of bitcoin private keys (secret protective pass codes) and isn\'t certain where they all are. That\'s the digital equivalent of saying that you\'re not sure where your money is kept. Start-ups like Xapo, Armory and, of course, Coinbase are hoping to address this problem by offering digital wallets to help consumers securely store their virtual currency savings.     Read MoreBitcoin needs more consumer protection    Since bitcoin keys are the digital equivalent of cash, the private key cannot be exposed to the public. The masses only see a consumer\'s public bitcoin "key," the address they use to sell and receive. Some individuals go so far as actually printing their private keys on paper to guarantee privacy. I expect to see a deluge of innovation in private key management in the coming months and years.   The applications of bitcoin go way beyond its use as an alternate currency. This leads to the third, and most complex, area of interest to investors. That said, it may be the area that generates the best return on investment in the long term. I refer to this as investing in the "decentralized trust model" of bitcoin. This new system leverages peer-to-peer computing and cryptographic techniques to create a new model for transactions that is both elegant and extremely useful.   It turns out that the bitcoin block-chain (which is a decentralized general ledger of bitcoin transactions) can be used to represent any type of asset, including traditional currencies, stocks, deeds and titles. It can even be used for alternative investments, like baseball cards, or used to place gambling bets. Companies are now starting to emerge, taking advantage of this new phenomenon. Two of the earliest pioneers: Ethereum and Colored Coins. Both start-ups combine earlier work in "smart contracts" (computer protocol that verifies transactions) with bitcoin\'s decentralized computing model to create a new platform for decentralized smart contracts.     Colored Coins uses the currency itself to represent other types of assets, such as traditional currencies, stocks or gold, which can be stored inside the bitcoin block-chain. Colored Coins provides extensions to bitcoin for these new asset types to be bought and sold via the standard bitcoin system.     Read MoreBitcoin hater Schiff now selling gold for bitcoins    Ethereum takes a slightly different approach and has developed its own bitcoin\u2013like currency\u2014called Ether\u2014for representing the myriad digital assets that can be created. Ethereum describes itself as "a platform and a programming language that makes it possible for any developer to build and publish next-generation distributed applications."     Ethereum and Colored Coins can, in theory, be used to securitize and trade just about anything, including domain names, financial assets, contracts and even intellectual property. While Ethereum addresses the problem of the limited float of bitcoin in creating any number of assets, Colored Coins may be more attractive, as it uses the existing bitcoin system for executing asset trades. The innovation happening in this area is a boon for e-commerce, no matter who wins favor with clients.  Ripple, another payments protocol, has also been making waves in this area of decentralized financial transactions. The Ripple currency, known as XRP, can be used to represent any form of asset, such as dollars, pesos and even bitcoin itself. It then allows exchanges of these assets to take place and settle directly on the Internet. Recently, Ripple has been gaining some traction with initial bank partners as a means for bypassing traditional correspondent banks to facilitate real-time settlement of cross-border currency wires. While bitcoin purists prefer a world with no central banks, Ripple embraces such institutions, which could mean that it may get short-term traction.     Is there room for more early-stage venture capital in the bitcoin ecosystem? The answer to that question may be the same as asking if there is more room to invest in the TCP/IP ecosystem\u2014of course, today we call that ecosystem the Internet.    \u2013Bill Barhydt,  co-founder & CEO of Boom Financial   See Bill Barhydt, along with Barry Templeton and Barry Silbert, talk about all things bitcoin and digital currency at the upcoming Exponential Finance Conference, presented by Singularity University and CNBC in New York City on   June 10 and 11.

"Recently more and more people are realizing how much of a world-changing technology bitcoin is," Roger Ver, the bitcoin investor sometimes known as "Bitcoin Jesus," wrote in an email to CNBC. "We will see more and more of this until each bitcoin is at least tens of thousands of dollars each. I think this will happen sooner than any of us expect."    The price of a bitcoin hit a low of $360 in April and had been hovering around $450 since April 25. But it started breaking away on May 20. It now sits at $665, according to CoinDesk.    The exact reason for this move is hard to pin down. The Bitcoin2014 Conference in Amsterdam drew to a close three days before the upswing started, and it featured some positive outlooks for the cryptocurrency from its 2,000 attendees.   Read More Dish to become largest company to accept bitcoin    "The fact that you have 51 countries (represented at the conference) and all of them have something positive to say about developments in their countries\u2014maybe this helped show that bitcoin is bigger than just the U.S., China and England," said Micky Malka, a general partner at venture capital firm Ribbit Capital and a board member of conference host Bitcoin Foundation. Marc Andreessen: Bitcoin long-term investment Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, compares Bitcoin to the Internet and sees it as a big long-term opportunity.    Malka said he has seen an increased interest in bitcoin over the past few months in the Silicon Valley venture capital community. An average round of funding for a bitcoin-related company drew in $1 million or $2 million in 2013, he said, but now routinely exceeds $20 million.    "(There is) momentum of serious committed entrepreneurs diving into building something with this technology," he said. "Venture investors are backing them and really starting to believe we can improve people\'s lives."   Read MoreMarc Andreessen in bitcoin for the long run    But the increasing acceptance of bitcoin beyond Silicon Valley may also be driving the trend.    Last week, Dish Network became the largest company to accept bitcoin payments. Payment processor Coinbase will handle the cryptocurrency for Dish, instantly converting bitcoins into dollars to eliminate price volatility concerns for the satellite TV company.    And the latest news of bitcoin acceptance comes from a potentially unlikely source: Rapper Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson, who is reportedly accepting the currency for his new album "Animal Ambition."  Watch CNBC\'s \'Bitcoin Uprising\'    "The positive news never stops," Ver said.    To be sure, bitcoin still receives its share of bad press. Earlier Tuesday, Erik Voorhees, the co-owner of two bitcoin-related sites, agreed to pay the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission roughly $51,000 to settle charges that he illegally offered shares of unregistered ventures.    And earlier this year, Manhattan federal prosecutors subpoenaed several bitcoin exchanges as part of an investigation into illegal online transactions.    Whatever the reason for it, though, the recent swing to the upside only begins to make up for lost ground since bitcoin\'s December highs above $1,100.   \u2014By CNBC\'s Everett Rosenfeld ', 'publisher': 'CNBC', 'author': {'twitterurl': u'http://twitter.com/Ev_Rosenfeld', 'name': u'Everett Rosenfeld', 'twitterhandle': u'Ev_Rosenfeld'}, 'url': 'http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/03/bitcoin-is-back-price-quietly-jumps-80-from-april-low.html', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 3, 16, 42, 56, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -14400)), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin is back: Price quietly jumps 80%'}, {'articleText': u' Why do rich divorcees want bitcoin?

Divorce settlements in England are seen as particularly generous to ex-wives, because judges recognize the equal contributions made by the breadwinner and the homemaker in a marriage, and divide the assets equally.

There\'s a compelling reason to believe in the bitcoin story, Fortress Investment Group Principal Michael Novogratz said Wednesday from the SALT Conference in Las Vegas.    The cryptocurrency with about $4.5 billion in circulation made headlines after the failure of Mt. Gox, one of its exchanges, and its links to illicit online purchases. It has had its share of supporters and detractors, but for Novogratz, it was "a simple proposition."    "When I look at the amount of human capital working on this project, there are probably 30,000 independent programmers out there, coding and working on bitcoin and bitcoin derivatives in this open-source community," he said, citing well-known venture capitalists as believers.

On CNBC\'s "Fast Money," Novogratz said that the market was difficult to read at the moment.    "Markets are easy for macro when they\'re trending and difficult when they\'re not trending," he said. "The idea is to have less chips on the table, to bet less and wait until the game shifts, and it will. It always does."    Novogratz said that he did not see a bubble in credit markets, especially as banks have de-levered.    "They typical credit crisis happens from banks, and we\'re not going to see it there," he said.     "Most of the credit has been shifted into the mutual fund industry, and mom and dad are not usually panic sellers because they\'re not leveraged. We do think there\'s not a lot of value in credit, and so it\'s kind of a boring environment for our credit business. But I don\'t see a bubble at any time short being popped," Novogratz added.   As for the bond market, Novogratz said that he saw a sign of something happening.    "I think we\'re squeezing the last people out of the shorts, and you\'ll see some reversal," he said.

"As an industry we need to be much more committed to consumer protection than we already are," said Blockchain.info COO Peter Smith said in an interview Monday at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York.        Blockchain, which builds software that allows users to securely manage their funds, is the Internet\'s most popular bitcoin service, with about 1.6 million wallets on its platform.   Read More Why bitcoin needs a marketing campaign    Educating consumers about the different types of bitcoin services, specifically exchanges and digital wallets, is one of the key things the community needs to do as soon as possible, Smith said.      Case in point: More than $450 million worth of bitcoin vanished when Mt.Gox, a popular bitcoin exchange, collapsed in February. Mt.Gox was a centralized trust, where all users\' coins are stored together in a master account. So when the exchange was the target of an attack, all bitcoins in the exchanged were vulnerable.   The centralization makes such exchanges riskier, and consumers need to be aware that they should only keep small amounts of money in such platforms, Smith said. Platforms like Mt.Gox a really made for people like day traders, and the average bitcoin enthusiast shouldn\'t keep large sums there, he said.    Smith said digital wallet services\u2014like his company\u2014have security features that allow users to store the private keys (which are needed to access their bitcoins) and send payments, and are probably more appropriate for the average consumer.    Blockchain\'s wallet service does not store its users\' bitcoins in a master account and cannot view a users\' balance or transactions, he said.  Read MoreWatch CNBC\'s \'Bitcoin Uprising\' Besides improving its consumer outreach, the bitcoin community also needs to address growing regulation concerns.    The failure of Mt.Gox has spurred calls to regulate the digital currency. But Smith said the industry should try to take the lead and regulate itself.     "I\'d like to see the Bitcoin Foundation [a nonprofit trade organization] take a more active role on this front," Smith said. "I\'d like to see them take a much more active role on consumer protection and self-regulation."   Read More Bitcoin bickering: How much regulation?

It\'s vulnerable to attacks. There is, however, a fix \u2014 something I had installed on my own coin experiment. Here\'s how it works:  The bitcoin software produces a mathematical equation that should take a miner ten minutes to solve.  Every two weeks the software looks back at the average time it has taken to solve the equation and if the miners have solved it in less than ten minutes, the equation is made more difficult. If the equation is taking longer than ten minutes to solve, then it is made easier. The purpose of this difficulty adjustment is to control the release of coins at a steady pace and to guard against inflation caused by a rapid expansion of the money supply.    Mining attacks occur when the computers used to solve the complex mathematical problems are faster than the software.  Miners can hoard coins before the software has a chance to make the equation more difficult.      As mining became more profitable, miners turned to application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and multipools.  Read MoreStung bitcoin investors plan Mt.Gox resurrection ASIC computers are purposely built to solve an equation much faster than every ten minutes and a computer arms race began as miners fought to be the first to solve the equation and receive free bitcoins. At the current rate, a fast and lucky miner can earn up to 25 bitcoins every ten minutes, or about $10,000. Profitability fostered fierce competition which made many miners turn their machines onto other coins and develop multipools. Multipools are groups of miners who work together to mine the most profitable digital currency.  For example, if the price of Dogecoin (an alternative to bitcoin) climbs, the multipools mine this coin and then dump the currency on the market. This mass inflow of supply reduces the price and by extension the mining profitability. Once profitability drops, the miners turn to another coin. The risk is that, without miners, transactions cannot be confirmed or conveyed \u2014 a coin without miners is a dead coin. Newer digital currencies like Dogecoin were vulnerable to a multipool mining attack.  Miners hoarding coins would immediately dump them on the market in order to make a quick buck \u2014 or bit, if you will. In order to guard against such acts the developers at Dogecoin turned to DigiByte (Digibyte.co). DigiByte is an alternative-digital currency with a unique defense against multipool mining.     The developers at DigiByte created DigiShield which adjusts the difficulty each time a new coin is produced as opposed to every two weeks.  This means that with a coin like DigiByte, every 60 seconds the equation is adjusted.  When DigiByte first tested DigiShield they witnessed over $1 million in computing power thrust at the coin in the first minutes of its life. Typically, coins would be hoarded and within 24 hours, the coin would be dead \u2014 but not with DigiShield. This algorithm adjusted to the miner\'s computing power so that transactions could be verified and miners would still make money.    I created my own bitcoin-like currency, Nautiluscoin (www.nautiluscoin.com), as an experiment. I wanted to learn about the technology and create awareness about digital currencies.    Read MoreHow I created my own bitcoin-like currency  Initially, I had big plans for Nautiluscoin \u2014 it was to be the first digital currency with a stabilization mechanism designed to reduce volatility.  As the project approached launch, its vulnerability to a mining attack was discovered by the team at  Austin Global Exchange (www.agx.io). From the time I conceived the coin and was ready for launch the mining technology had advanced well beyond the software. Bitcoin mining had become so profitable that miners were paying $20,000 for a $1,500 computer, just to be the first to have the latest technology for bitcoin mining. The rationale was that the $20,000 spent on the machine would probably be recouped within 90 days of mining.  Creating a digital currency "Fast Money" trader Brian Kelly ventures into the digital currency world and walks through the steps of making his very own cryptocoin from scratch.   I was fortunate to meet the team at DigiByte and have them install DigiShield on Nautiluscoin. This upgrade will not only protect Nautiluscoin from an attack, but it will allow Nautiluscoin to processes transactions ten times faster than bitcoin. It has also made the currency robust enough to implement the original plan of creating a stability fund.  So why have the developers at bitcoin not implemented a solution like DigiShield? The simple answer is that it\'s not needed \u2014 yet.  Bitcoin mining is so competitive that it makes mining other digital currencies more profitable, but if (or when) the profitability drops, miners could turn away from bitcoin. As the competition fades, bitcoin could become susceptible to a multipool attack.  Read MoreOp-ed: Why Warren Buffett is wrong on bitcoin With the multipool protection from DigiShield and the stabilization fund, I have decided to re-launch the coin and implement the original plan.  Nautiluscoin will be traded on the Austin Global Exchange, which will serve as the official rate-setting exchange. Once I have established a liquid trading market for Nautiluscoin the next step is acceptance.  In addition to being able to use the coin online for purchases, I believe there is a fertile market for small business.  As the technology advances, the road map will include pre-loaded Nautiluscoin cards which could be used at your local merchant.  Further down the road, I hope to have a market established to trade Nautiluscoin for gold.  With any digital currency the value comes from acceptance \u2014 my job now is to steward this acceptance.

Whichever traders have access to the highest quality of information are capable of making the most informed investment decisions and therefore have the highest probability of success. That's why before putting money on the line, professional investors spend countless hours digging through SEC filings, creating elaborate earnings models, and talking to every expert on a potential investment opportunity that they can find. Unfortunately though, no matter how many painstaking measures an investor takes to leave no stone unturned, all of his or her hard work can be undermined by corporate insiders acting on or sharing material nonpublic information.     There is no group of people on the planet that have a better incentive to stop insider trading than the other traders who stand to lose because of it.    The SEC plays an important role in financial markets as a regulator, but they don't have quite as strong of a motivation to stop insider trading as investors do. The SEC doesn't get punished in any concrete way whatsoever for failing to discover instances of insider trading. Meanwhile, investors have cash positions vulnerable to devaluation when insiders sell stock or advise others to sell illegally on material nonpublic information.  Read MoreThe truth about insider trading: Ex-Galleon Trader In an ideal world we would have a mechanism for investors to catch each other and report insider trading to the SEC who would then act as the enforcer and prosecutor rather than an initial investigator.   Luckily, it's becoming more and more possible to imagine a situation where a similar system exists. Just as some new technologies including self-deleting text messages from apps like Mark Cuban-backed Cyber Dust or Confide could theoretically make insider trading easier to pull off, other innovations could help to shift the burden of discover away from the SEC to where it belongs \u2014 in the hands of investors.   Read MoreWhy Warren Buffett is wrong on bitcoin    To be clear, new technology isn't necessary for insider trading either. Just last month, an incident came to light where a confidant would write down illegal tips on a sticky note, share the note with a trader, and finally eat the note to destroy the evidence. Sometimes the illegal information does not travel across the web or electronically at all. But there's one system out there that could someday be used to catch all forms of insider trading, no matter how the materially nonpublic information is shared. The system I'm talking about is the bitcoin protocol.    Holding bitcoin as an asset, currency, or whatever you want to call it may not make sense to everyone. But those who understand bitcoin well realize that the block chain as it's referred to, could be a game changing innovation even outside the realm of bitcoin.     Essentially, the block chain is a public ledger where all bitcoin transactions are recorded pseudonymously. We can all see every time a bitcoin moves from person A to person B, but we have no idea who person A and B are.   How it would work   Imagine a stock market where every trade had to be conducted on a public ledger like the block chain. If traders could see all the actions of other traders, it would be nearly impossible to get away with insider trading. Every institutional investor out there would develop algorithms to catch other traders who are engaging in highly suspicious or illegal activity. Next, insider traders discovered by the investors themselves would get reported to the SEC for further investigation and potential prosecution.   Read MoreHow I created my own bitcoin-like currency: Brian Kelly    Firms wouldn't need to give up the name tag associated with their trades either. Just like on the block chain, how we saw person A transfer a bitcoin to person B, we would see trade account A buy or sell a certain number of shares of stock without knowing who owns that account. The SEC could have its own method to privately identify the accused when sufficient evidence is presented.    It's not perfectly clear how the ultimate future of preventing insider trading will play out, but it's certainly not too early to start thinking about ways that we could improve the process. In a world where government regulators will always be one or more steps behind traders using the most cutting edge technology to cheat, allowing the community to police itself via the block chain would be game-changing.

Under the agreement, which was announced late on Monday evening, these investors will join forces with a consortium called Sunlot Holdings and would settle two class-action lawsuits for fraud and other charges brought against the Tokyo exchange.   Sunlot, which is backed by child-actor turned entrepreneur Brock Pierce and William Quigley, the managing director at California-based Clearstone Venture Partners, aims to resurrect Mt.Gox and, if successful, would immediately distribute its assets on a proportional basis to the 127,000 affected customers.  Read MoreMt.Gox revamp rejected, goes into administration  The estimated 50,000 customers - who have over $200 million in losses, according to Sunlot - would also receive a 16.5 percent interest in Sunlot, allowing them to share in company dividends, as well as benefit from any future buyout or IPO (initial purchase offering).    "The fund would conduct forensic investigations and pursue prosecution of perpetrators. An incentive bounty of 10 percent of recovered assets would reward those participating in the recovery," Sunlot said in Monday\'s press release.   The Tokyo-based exchange - which once claimed it handled around 80 percent of all global dollar trades for bitcoin - was an online marketplace where people could buy or sell bitcoins using different currencies. Rather than filing for bankruptcy in late February, the company opted for a Chapter 11-style civil rehabilitation that gave the company time to reorganize its affairs with lawyers treating it as an ongoing concern.   Read MoreBack to work at bitcoin\'s embattled Mt.Gox   At the time, it detailed outstanding debts of about 6.5 billion Japanese yen ($63.6 million), 850,000 lost bitcoins and 127,000 empty-handed customers. It blamed the bitcoins\' disappearance on a bug in the cryptocurrency\'s framework called "transaction malleability," meaning bitcoins may have been illicitly moved by hackers out of their accounts.    On April 16, Mt.Gox had its plans to rebuild the company rejected by a Tokyo court and was placed into administration. Meanwhile, 200,000 of the lost bitcoins had been recovered since the original bankruptcy filing.  Bitcoin has a \'great future\' in 2015: Clearstone William Quigley, Managing Director at Clearstone Venture Partners, discusses his optimism about the cyrptocurrency and the firm\'s offer to acquire Mt.Gox.  Read MoreA user just filed the first lawsuit against Mt.Gox    "This is the customers\' best option and the only chance they have for full restitution," said Jay Edelson of U.S.-based law firm Edelson PC, in Monday\'s press release. "Liquidation, on the other hand, would be a disaster for customers, making them endure a long wait only to recover an immaterial percentage of their losses.  The customers want and deserve a real opportunity to be made whole, and we are hopeful that their wishes are respected."    Two defendants from the Tokyo-based exchange, founder Jed McCaleb and former marketing chief Gonzague Gay-Bouchery, have agreed to the terms of the settlement, according to Sunlot.    The settlement will be presented in a federal court in Chicago on May 1 for preliminary approval, but the sale would have to be approved by a Tokyo court. Sunlot stated that class action suits in both the United States and Canada would continue against CEO Mark Karpeles and Mt.Gox\'s parent company Tibanne, with the aim of seeking additional recovery for customers.

BTC China - in the top five of the most commonly used bitcoin exchanges, according to Bitcoinity.org - said over the weekend that it had suspended yuan deposits from the China Merchant Bank, following guidance the bank had posted on its website. CEO of BTC China Bobby Lee confirmed to CNBC that the exchange had also received a telephone call from the bank Monday, formally directing the exchange to cease transactions from its account.     Lee said that the bank had indicated the guidance came from "their superiors in the Beijing main office after a directive from the central bank." Lee added that all other withdrawals from other Chinese banks were as normal.  Read MoreBitcoin defies talk of China crackdown   The often volatile price of the virtual currency took another hit on the news, with the price of one bitcoin falling to $424 by Monday morning, according to industry website CoinDesk, a fall of around 14 percent from Friday\'s price.    BTC China\'s announcement adds to the growing uncertainty regarding regulation in China. Local media had reported that April 15 was a possible deadline set by the People\'s Bank of China (PBoC) for Chinese banks to freeze the accounts of bitcoin exchanges. Exchanges BTC Trade and Huobi.com both signaled earlier in the month that their banks had closed their accounts on, or close to, this deadline.    This speculation regarding regulation begun in early December 2013, after a price surge in bitcoin which many attributed to growing enthusiasm from Chinese investors. A statement released by the PBoC on December 5 warned of the risks associated with bitcoin, saying that Chinese financial institutions should not trade the digital currency.   Read MoreBitcoin stumbles on fears of China clampdown    Last month, a report by Chinese news site Caixin stated that the PBoC had introduced measures which would target 15 bitcoin-trading websites, adding that banks - who have these companies as clients - would be punished if they failed to close their accounts by the April deadline.    The PBoC moved quickly to deny these reports but these announcements by the exchanges would now appear to contradict that. What\'s more, BTC China\'s new announcement means that no exchange is immune to the clampdown with the company being the last exchange to be notified.    Lee iterated to CNBC that the only formal guideline on bitcoin by Chinese authorities was still the communication on December 5. "It has not shown any new guidance," he said, but added that he would take appropriate steps if it did issue an official statement but could not predict what the next step by the PBoC would be.

That\'s the consensus among a group of currency experts who spoke with CNBC about the future of money as part of the CNBC 25 special report. But even if the dollar retains its dominance and bitcoin fades away, that doesn\'t mean the state of money won\'t change a lot over the next quarter century. Lawyers, guns & dollars  CNBC\'s Ted Kemp discusses how it\'s not just the legal transactions of the world that support the dollar as a reserve currency, but the illegal ones such as guns and drugs.   The very volume of dollars in the world has given many people a conviction that the currency is worthless and doomed to lose its status as a global reserve currency. But if you want real insight into the dollar\'s status as a reserve currency, said ConvergEx chief market strategist Nicholas Colas, a good place to start is the $100 bill.  Many economists look at the hundred as a proxy for foreign demand for U.S. currency. Roughly 77 percent of the total $1.2 trillion in circulation in 2013 was denominated in $100 bills, according to Federal Reserve data. And most of those hundreds\u2014about two-thirds of them, according to one Fed economist\u2014are held outside the United States.   "And demand is increasing for hundreds," said Colas, who added that the dollar is likely to remain a global reserve currency as long as it\'s the way global markets price "gold and oil and guns." (Just like global markets for crude oil and gold, arms transactions of all sizes usually take place in dollars, largely because the United States makes more than two-thirds of those sales.)    In the end, money is anchored in trust, Colas noted, and no entity on Earth can match the U.S. track record for being good for its debt. The European central bank doesn\'t have a history nearly as long as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the euro zone entered a crisis in 2009 from which it still hasn\'t fully recovered, and the Chinese yuan is hobbled by tight\u2014and completely nontransparent\u2014government control.   The United States also tries harder than most nations to prevent counterfeiting, Colas said, pointing to $120 million the U.S. spent to redesign the new $100 bill last year.   Read MoreWill China use gold to internationalize the yuan?    "The $100 bill is the world\'s bitcoin," Colas said. "It\'s anonymous. It\'s easy to use. It\'s actually easier than bitcoin, because you don\'t need a computer or even power."  In short, the dollar is trusted for transactions domestic and international, legal and illegal. Colas described the ubiquity of the $100 by pointing to the five-inch aluminum Zero Halliburton briefcase, which has been made famous in film and TV as a secure money carrier. It was designed to carry 22 pounds of $100 notes, which neatly comes out to $1 million, Colas said.  Asked if the briefcase would accommodate $1 million in $100 bills, Zero Halliburton\'s vice president of operations and finance, Debbie Pawigon, told CNBC, "We\'re pretty sure that\'s true."  Creating a digital currency "Fast Money" trader Brian Kelly ventures into the digital currency world and walks through the steps of making his very own cryptocoin from scratch. Bitcoin, whose credibility took a hit with the spectacular collapse of its largest exchange, Mt.Gox, in February, may not dominate the world as a virtual currency in 25 years, but the idea of digitized money may. And the reason is as old as capitalism itself: lower costs. "The really interesting story in money is its digitization, and the huge amount of friction that exists in the system, and the way that technology destroys all those costs," said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX Strategy at BK Asset Management. From a purely technological perspective, the ability to pay anyone instantly in any currency exists already, with minimal or even no transaction costs. Banks are resistant to such a no-fee money marketplace, because they now profit by acting as intermediaries for transactions. In the coming years, however, "insurgents" will make those transactions easier and cheaper, Schlossberg said. Read MoreDollar reserve role secure but set to shrink: BIS Facebook, for example, could facilitate user-to-user payments for less money than a bank charges, Schlossberg said. He spoke to CNBC four days before a report in the \nFinancial Times said that Facebook plans to do that very thing by making it possible for people to send payments and store money via its social network. A Facebook spokesperson whom CNBC asked about the report said that the company "declines to comment on rumors and speculation." Schlossberg also pointed to Xoom, which lets consumers make payments internationally, and Square, which makes it possible to take payments through handheld devices, as other firms on the forefront of digitized transactions. Bitcoin\'s value is as a medium of exchange, not as a currency per se, said Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX. In fact, most money today is already electronic form. "The bank isn\'t holding a lot of money in there. The money in your account is data," he said. "It\'s a set of zeros and ones." Where consumers once wired money through Western Union for fee, they now pay a much smaller percentage-based fee through PayPal. The best thing about bitcoin, Vecchio said, is that it\'s basically free to use. Of course, so is cash.    "The future of money will really be on finding ways to transact in a lower-cost way, and that\'s a societal trend, not just bitcoin," Vecchio said. IRS: Bitcoin is property, not currency CNBC\'s Eamon Javers reports the IRS is saying bitcoin should be treated as a property, not a currency. When it comes to the dollar, the case for the status quo is stronger than the case against it, said Colas, but he acknowledged that the Federal Reserve has put the United States into uncharted territory. Quantitative easing represents an unprecedented level of monetary engagement by the Federal Reserve. "It really is unique," said Colas, who called the results of QE so far positive, but modest. "We have a Federal Reserve with a balance sheet of $4.2 trillion. The number before the financial crisis was $800 billion." Many economists\u2014including Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Charles Plosser\u2014worry about the Fed\'s central role in the economy. Many regular investors, especially fans of gold, think an overabundance of U.S. dollars in the world means that the currency will inevitably collapse. The more strident in the gold camp think the United States will go down with it. How to invest in gold Jeff Largey, head of metals and mining research at Macquarie Group, explains why his outlook for gold remains conservative and discusses gold mining stocks.    But over the next 25 years, said DailyFX\'s Vecchio, the more likely scenario is that if the dollar declines as a global currency, it will do so because America\'s portion of the global economy declines, not the other way around. "In terms of the dollar itself, people have been talking about the coming collapse of the dollar, but it\'s been losing value since 1980. It\'s hard to say that the dollar has been building up and is about to collapse," Vecchio said. Read MoreThe difference between a \'bear market\' and a \'correction\' According to the most recent Triennial Central Bank Survey from the Bank of International Settlements, the U.S. dollar was incorporated on one side or the other of 87 percent of global foreign exchange transactions in April 2013. That\'s an increase from 85 percent three years earlier.  Part of that increase can be accounted for by the decline of the euro during that period, Vecchio said. But regardless, the data indicates that the role of the dollar increased rather than decreased during the financial crisis. America\'s growing status as a global energy powerhouse further argues for a stronger U.S. economy\u2014and strong U.S. dollar\u2014in a quarter century. "People have been saying the dollar is going to collapse for 20 years," Vecchio said.

Credit cards could be the most protected way to pay  CNBC\'s Kelli Grant talks about the types of protection available to credit and debit card holders in the transition to a cashless society.   We\'re finally on the brink of the cashless society that futurists and other have been forecasting for years. The average consumer owns at least two credit cards and early adopters have begun ditching plastic for virtual wallets. Even businesses that used to rely heavily on cash \u2014 think taxis, food trucks or even craft fairs \u2014 can now go cashless, thanks to new technology like Square.    Yet, the more we abandon paper bills for plastic, smartphone payments and even cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the perils of the new, cashless economy are becoming more apparent. Recent security breaches at Target, Neiman Marcus and other retailers illustrate the vulnerability of electronic payments to hacking attacks.    There were 2,164 reported security incidents exposing 822 million records last year, nearly doubling the previous highest year, 2011, according to Risk Based Security, a data security firm. The pace seems to be continuing this year.  Chip-and-pin cards, in use in Europe for years, would remove some of the threat. Computer chips embedded on the cards verify unique personal identification numbers consumers punch into terminals. The cards would help reduce fraud, but it\'s not clear how much. For instance, they don\'t help prevent online fraud.The problem is cost. Making the cards and installing the new terminals needed to read them is expensive. Consumer advocates want Congress to press retailers and banks for fast adoption of chip-and-pin technology.

"Policymakers must also take action to encourage investments in technology to tighten up the security of our financial institutions."    Data breaches aren\'t the only downside.

Of course, it\'s not just companies that want to make a buck. A recent episode of "The Good Wife" showed how a fictional (we hope) NSA might operate. The agency had been listening to the "good wife\'s" phone conversations at the office as well as her estranged husband, the governor. Therefore, the governor had an aide post a "for sale" notice at a local mosque for an incredible deal on a pre-owned car \u2014 the number to call was that of the local head of the NSA. Dozens of men with Arabic names called the man at his office, and he was fired.   Read MoreBitcoin boss Karpeles easily led, not dishonest - mother    Privacy experts suspect that if the NSA is capable of recording information about people\'s phone calls, it is certainly monitoring electronic purchases. "That is a civil liberties concern," says Scott Shay, chairman of Signature Bank. "When governments have information they are sometimes tempted to use it, and sometimes they attempt to use it in ways that are not fully vetted by due process."   Since electronic payments can be traced, authorities may be able to curtail or even eliminate crime, including everything from prostitution to terrorism. But constant government monitoring could turn everyone into a potential suspect, creating distrust between government and citizens that could lead to "vast consequences," economist Domagoj Sajter of the University of Osijek in Croatia wrote in a research paper published in March 2013 titled "Privacy, Identity, and the Perils of the Cashless Society."    Individuals and organizations may be unwilling to promote unpopular or unconventional ideas if they know their transactions are being monitored. "Ultimately, this would lead to a weaker form of democracy, in which certain voices could not be heard and lobbied for."   Read MoreWhy bitcoin needs a marketing campaign    It is possible that the government could monitor electronic purchases in an attempt to police crime, says David Stearns, a historian and sociologist specializing in electronic payments at the University of Washington. From a technological standpoint, the feat would be relatively easy. But whether it will happen remains uncertain, he says.    Even it does happen, criminals would simply use a different currency, be it digital or physical, he added. For instance, in times of hyperinflation in the past, people bartered with cigarettes. "The idea that it will eliminate all fraud and crime is a little optimistic."   Stearns sees a cash-limited society as far more likely than a cashless society.   Read MoreMt.

It is a phenomenon that has been revolutionizing journalism and entertainment; and, by helping to overcome coordination challenges, it has also had political consequences in a growing number of countries \u2014 all of which means an ever-evolving set of opportunities and risks.  What is less appreciated, however, is the extent to which a broadly similar phenomenon may be starting to play out in finance, via a democratization process that could gradually reconfigure a notable part of the institutional landscape, particularly in consumer finance, while challenging regulators to adapt. Bitcoin is the most visible \u2014 albeit far from a good \u2014 example of this nascent development, having attracted attention from specialists, regulators, and, slowly but surely, the public. But the crypto-currency phenomenon is far from the only example, and it is certainly not the most consequential one. Its impact, both actual and potential, is relatively limited when compared to ongoing attempts to enhance and democratize lending, borrowing, investing, and payments and settlements.    The underlying sequence of disruptive technology is historically familiar. A bold innovation suddenly lowers entry barriers for certain activities. Mechanisms emerge to enable a larger part of the population to participate in what is deemed desirable but, until now, had been hard to access. As the disruptive forces gain traction, existing business models face difficult adaptation challenges, and regulators begin to fall behind. The situation is often amplified by a natural human tendency to overproduce and over-consume hitherto restricted goods and services.  Read MoreHow I created my own bitcoin-like currency: Brian Kelly   This, of course, is what has been occurring in media for several years. The result is a proliferation of platforms for producing, aggregating, disseminating, and consuming content. Falling entry barriers and lower access costs have significantly democratized participation, whether in production or consumption. And, as hard as they try, many traditional media outlets \u2014 especially those unable to claim quite distinctive content \u2014 find it increasingly difficult to compete.    Now something somewhat similar is starting to happen in finance as well, albeit at a less frantic pace and \u2014 at least until now \u2014 in a less disruptive manner. And, as with media, the main innovations are being spearheaded by those outside the traditional institutional setup. Most consequentially, an emerging cohort of technology entrepreneurs understand the power of online/social media innovation to disrupt components of traditional finance, and are now leading efforts that include behavioral scientists and finance experts.   Recall that Bitcoin started in 2009 as an attempt to produce a "better" currency, championed especially by those who mistrust central banks\' management of fiat money. These early adopters were joined by a growing number of financial speculators attracted by highly volatile price movements. But Bitcoin\'s success, which remains highly uncertain, ultimately depends on it attaining sufficient stability to perform the most essential function of any currency (as opposed to a speculative commodity) \u2014 that of providing a relatively predictable medium of exchange.    Fulfilling that function would require a lot to happen. At a minimum, Bitcoin would need a more solid institutional foundation; and broad acceptance of it would require much greater clarity concerning regulatory and supervisory approaches.  Watch CNBC\'s bitcoin documentary: \'Bitcoin Uprising\' More promising examples, albeit less well-known, may be found in Internet-driven lending and borrowing clubs or, more generally, the peer-to-peer initiatives in consumer financial services. By seeking to compress net interest margins, including through lower expenses and more efficient data assessments and aggregation, and by targeting an enhanced consumer experience, such empowerment schemes could serve to reduce the cost of financial intermediation while providing for fairer risk-pooling outcomes and better credit underwriting. Likewise, so-called digital wallets and mobile transfers are efforts to improve payments and settlement in a retail financial sector that gets a lot less attention than its institutional peers.   The prospects for each of these democratizing developments vary significantly, as do the probable cost-benefit equations. Much will depend on whether the underlying technology is stable and secure, trust is established, transparency is convincing, consumer protection is effective, new content is coupled well with strong distribution channels, and broad-based validation and institutional verification boost credibility.   Looking ahead, we should expect the underlying forces of innovation to remain strong. Some existing businesses will fend off disruptive threats, including through takeovers; others will adjust (for example, Walmart recently announced an expansion of its financial-services offerings); but many may well prove insufficiently agile. Regulators will also likely lag initially in their response to new structures and activities.    The challenges of getting this right in finance are considerably more difficult than they are in media; and the consequences are far more profound, given the centrality of finance to broad swaths of the real economy. Anyone who doubts that should recall how last decade\'s securitization boom and bust \u2013 another example of a disruptive financial innovation that was over-produced and over-consumed \u2013 contributed to a credit and liquidity crisis that pushed the global economy to the verge of Great Depression II.

"The Tokyo District Court recognized that it would be difficult for the company to carry out the civil rehabilitation proceedings and decided to dismiss the application...and at the same time, issued an order for provisional administration," the document, written by attorney-at-law Nobuaki Kobayashi said, who has now been appointed as the provisional administrator.

However, that still leaves $325 million of the cryptocurrency, valued at today\'s market prices, unaccounted for.    Following the February filing, an investigation has taken place into the missing funds but still requires some more time, according to embattled CEO Mark Karpeles.

For Steve Vittitoe, bitcoin is a fun way to make some extra money.    This unassuming 31-year-old family man, who is a computer programmer for a cybersecurity firm, runs a mini bitcoin-mining operation from the basement of his home in Valparaiso, Ind.     "It\'s as if there\'s a machine in my corner printing money," Vittitoe said.    In one corner of his basement he has set up a rack of specially equipped computers. These are called "miners" in the world of bitcoin. The machines run 24 hours a day, competing against other computers around the world to solve complex math problems. The first computer, or group of computers, that solve the problem receives a fixed amount of bitcoins.        Vittitoe\'s mining operation produces 1.2 bitcoins a day. If bitcoin trades for $600, that means $720 worth of bitcoins a day, or $262,000 a year. But that is a big "if" given bitcoin\'s volatility.

He gets paid in bitcoins and except for rent and gas, pays for most of his living expenses using dollar-denominated gift cards he bought with bitcoin.

Chinese bitcoin companies BTC Trade and Huobi.com backed those reports last week. Both exchanges signaled that their banks were due to close their accounts before, or close to, Tuesday\'s deadline.   Read More Bitcoin stumbles on fears of China clampdown    A spokesperson for BTC Trade told CNBC via email on Tuesday that it had received a phone call from the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), informing that it would no longer be supported by the bank. However, BTC Trade added that no written confirmation had been sent and that it was now looking at the possibility of opening up in a different country. ABC was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.   However, BTC Trade\'s experience is not common with other exchanges. BTC China, a leading exchange in the country and one of the world\'s busiest bitcoin exchanges, said that it had received no such communication from either the central bank or its own account provider.    "As far as we know it\'s business as usual, " CEO Bobby Lee told CNBC Tuesday. "We have not received any calls or any changes in regulation."    Speculation regarding how Chinese authorities were going to regulate the cryptocurrency began in early December 2013, after a price surge in bitcoin which many attributed to growing enthusiasm from Chinese investors.  Read MoreBitcoin price halves as China clampdown escalates   A statement was released on the website of China\'s central bank on December 5 which warned of the cryptocurrency\'s risks, saying that Chinese financial institutions should not trade the digital currency.    On December 18, Chinese news website Yicai.com reported that the PBoC had ordered third-party payment providers to stop using the virtual currency and had been ordered to stop any "custody, trading and other services" related to bitcoin.    Speculation stepped up a notch last month with a report by Chinese news site Caixin, which said the PBoC had introduced measures which would target 15 bitcoin-trading websites, adding that banks - who have these companies as clients - would be punished if they failed to close their accounts by the April deadline.  China has a big influence on bitcoin market: Pro David Moskowitz, director at Coin Republic, discusses the extent of China\'s influence on bitcoin amid reports that the country accounts for half of the market trading last year.   The PBoC has denied these most recent reports. It took to micro-blogging site Weibo on March 21 to claim state that reports of the deadline were untrue and that the guidelines set out on December 5 were the only formal communication it had released on the digital currency.    BTC China\'s Lee also dismissed the recent reports as just "rumors in the media", saying that there has been no amendments or updates since the December 5 PBoC statement.

"(The exchanges are) offering voucher systems, they\'re going to be launching some ATMs there as well," he told CNBC Tuesday. "We\'ll see if the government bans those too."

When I first heard of bitcoin, I thought it was a scam \u2014 maybe even a scheme \u2014 and definitely the mother of all bubbles.     In fact, you can even find a tape of me on "Fast Money" calling it Tulipmania 2.0, a reference to the Dutch Tulip bubble of the 1600\'s. I was convinced that a string of numbers backed by nothing could never serve as a viable currency. Like many others, my "aha" moment came when I started thinking about bitcoin as a payment system. Viewing bitcoin as more than a currency allowed me to see that it has all the hallmarks of a revolutionary technology \u2014 it is strong, fast and efficient.   Bitcoin\'s strength is the lack of a single point of failure.  When hackers attacked Target, they had it easy \u2014 all they had to do was find an open door into the single database that contained all the customers\' personal information. Bitcoin does not require personal information and the database is distributed across an infinite amount of computers. While hackers have been able to find a way into some computers, none of the attacks hobbled the entire organization. Even the failure of Mt. Gox, formerly the largest bitcoin exchange, hardly caused a hiccup. Imagine if a major stock exchange closed without warning \u2014 our financial system would be in shambles!   Read MoreBuffett blasts bitcoin as a \'mirage\': \'Stay away!\'    Bitcoin is fast because it reinvents the middleman. Think about what it takes to transfer money from one person to another: First, we both have to open a bank account which is accompanied by a mountain of paperwork to verify identities. Then, I need to instruct my bank to withdraw money from my account by writing a check, sending a wire or using an electronic debit. Once it arrives, the payment needs to be verified, cleared and delivered. Numerous points of friction exist, racking up fees along the way.    Bitcoin is efficient because the middleman is compensated by the technology. The bitcoin software pays the middleman (aka miners) a predetermined amount of money. Paying the miners bitcoins is also the channel by which the money supply steadily develops. The miners compete to be the first to solve a mathematical equation which processes the transaction and ensures the bitcoins are not counterfeit. The first to solve the problem receives freshly minted bitcoins. It is this innovation that makes it impractical to strip the currency from the technology. The currency is an integral part, similar to how without the "@"sign, email would not work.   Arguing about whether it is a currency misses the point of the technology. Bitcoin is a tool that securely verifies, clears and conveys financial transactions. In short, it redefines the role of the middleman in the financial-services industry. Email enabled us to send a better message, faster and more efficiently than the \'snail mail\' through the post office. Bitcoin does the same thing for money.  Read MoreWhy Warren Buffett is wrong on bitcoin   The currency component of bitcoin holds the potential to create a new, investable asset class. The next generation of bitcoin is the appcoin, or coins designed to solve specific problems. Developers are hard at work finding niche markets and creating coins to serve them. These coins, or more accurately crypto-equity, can be used to efficiently raise funds for charitable organizations or provide venture financing.     I was bitten by the bitcoin bug almost a year ago and have absorbed as much about the technology as my brain will allow. Then, in January, I read about a way to create my very own digital currency using a website called Coigen (www.coingen.io).  I tried my hand at the technology and created the "BKoin." Within an hour, Coingen created the BKoin and I downloaded the software. I was ready and eager to challenge bitcoin, but there was a problem ... nobody knew the BKoin existed! What\'s more, digital currencies need a network of computers to work and my lonely laptop needed some friends. The challenge then became to raise awareness and create a market for my coin.   Creating a market for my coin intrigued me, so I dusted off my Econ 101 book. Buried in one chapter was a reference to Friedrich Hayek\'s book, "The Denationalization of Money," in which he advocated for the creation of privately-issued currencies. Hayek theorized that people would gravitate to the most stable currency and, in a flash of brilliance or insanity, I had my answer \u2014 create my very own central bank! If I could create the currency, I would be able to sell it on a digital-currency exchange and use the proceeds to place buy orders for the coin. I thought that by creating buy orders and slowly selling coins, I could establish a stable growth pattern. Through stability, I thought I would attract users just as Hayek surmised.    I went back to Coigen and created another coin called Nautiluscoin (www.nautiluscoin.com), so named because a nautilus grows at a steady, stable rate. The next step was listing on an exchange where I could sell my newly-minted coins and place my buy orders. I contacted Austin Global Exchange (www.agx.io) and within days, Nautiluscoin was ready to begin trading.   Read MoreBitcoin: The future of M&A deals?    However, since my last foray with BKoin, the mining technology had far outpaced the software and my new coin was vulnerable. During the due diligence process, the team at AGX found a flaw in my coin which would allow miners with powerful computers to hoard all my coins. After contacting a coin developer, I found out that fixing my coin would require a significant investment of time and money.  Since the project began as a way to learn,  I decided that the best use of Nautiluscoin was education.  Nautiluscoin, like bitcoin, isn\'t a solo endeavor; it\'s a network that requires a supportive community. So, feel free to try it. If you are like me, comfort comes from experience. Bitcoin and other digital currencies shouldn\'t be viewed as a threat. In the same way that email made communications better, created countless jobs and germinated new businesses, this asset class will also create opportunity. Email fortified the financial industry\u2014and so will digital currencies.

The rules governing bitcoin that limit the creation of the open-source virtual currency to 21 million units could one day be modified if a majority of its users were in agreement, said a top executive at one of the world\'s largest bitcoin "mining" companies.    George Kikvadze, board member and advisor of BitFury, said Monday that if the notion of a finite number of bitcoins was ever altered it would be fair and should not undermine the value. During an interview Monday on CNBC\'s "Squawk Box," he likened it to when "governments go in and print money." About 12.6 million bitcoins are in circulation now.  Read MoreCNBC explains bitcoin   Addressing concern in the bitcoin community about government regulation, he said he actually welcomes it as means of giving people confidence in the peer-to-peer payment system. "We need the regulation to get to that stage. Look at the Internet in \'93 and \'94, [bitcoin] is in the early stage of adoption," he said. "Regulation is good."    Last month, the Internal Revenue Service said it will treat bitcoins\u2014and similar virtual currencies\u2014as property, not currency for federal tax purposes. Meanwhile, Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\'s Department of Financial Services, said he intends to provide regulations later this year, that could make New York the first U.S. state to regulate virtual currencies. "We want to be at the negotiating table" as these new regulations and rules are developed, Kikvadze said.  Read MoreIRS says bitcoin is property rather than currency    BitFury makes proprietary chips to enable the "mining" of bitcoin. "You can use this chip for bitcoin-like coins as well," said founder Val Vavilovs.    Anyone can "mine" for bitcoins with the right software and hardware. Advocacy group bitcoin.org\u2014operated by core developers of the so-called cryptocurrency\u2014describes the process on its website.    "New bitcoins are generated by a competitive and decentralized process called \'mining\'. This process involves that individuals are rewarded by the network for their services. Bitcoin miners are processing transactions and securing the network using specialized hardware and are collecting new bitcoins in exchange."     "Mining" is a slow process and the protocol calls for bitcoin to be created at a predictable and decreasing rate\u2014automatically halving over time until issuance halts with a total of 21 million bitcoins in existence. "It\'s probably going to be in the next 15 to 20 years," Kikvadze explained.    Created in 2009, bitcoin has no single overseer like a central bank.    In fact, Kikvadze pointed out that even Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman had favored abolishing the Federal Reserve and going to a machine program that would keep the quantity of money going up at a steady rate.

The online currency, which is created by "miners" who solve complex math puzzles and can be traded on a number of exchanges, has seen its price fall sharply through the year amid a number of scandals and bankruptcies.    Since early March, bitcoin has lost a third of its value, most recently on the heels of a reported crackdown by the People\'s Bank of China.    Casares, though, believes the downturn will be short-lived as the virtual currency gains attraction in areas with unstable monetary situations.

The People\'s Bank of China is considering whether to order the country\'s banks to close Bitcoin trading accounts, according to people familiar with the matter. If that order goes through, it would eliminate the last major remaining channel by which people in China can buy the virtual currency.  Read MoreHow bitcoin really changed the world   Caixin, a local financial magazine, first reported the ban last week, saying it would come into effect by April 15. But the country\'s Bitcoin exchanges say they have not yet received notices from their banks and that business continues as usual, for now.    "This would be a bad thing for the exchanges. But it is certainly within the realm of what the government is allowed to do. We are taking things one day at a time," said Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTC China, one of the country\'s top exchanges.    The price of Bitcoin in China has fallen to Rmb2,950 ($475), down 17 per cent since Thursday when the Caixin report was published. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 60 per cent from its peak in November, shortly before the Chinese authorities announced the first of their measures to rein in the virtual currency\'s then-explosive growth in China.    Beijing ruled in December that individuals were free to buy and sell Bitcoin at their own risk. But after deeming it to be an online product rather than a currency, the government prohibited all Chinese financial institutions from conducting any Bitcoin transactions. It also barred third-party payment providers from serving Bitcoin exchanges.  Read MoreAndreessen skewers Buffett for doubting bitcoin    China\'s plucky Bitcoin exchanges \u2013 many of which are run by tech entrepreneurs who chafe against government regulations \u2013 thought they had found a way around the ban on payment providers. By accepting payment from customers directly in their corporate accounts, the exchanges themselves filled the gap left by payment providers and allowed people to continue buying Bitcoins.    The new central bank document threatens to end that, by preventing China\'s Bitcoin exchanges from even holding corporate bank accounts.    Nevertheless, an executive with one of China\'s leading Bitcoin exchanges, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he believed the new regulations were in draft stage and that they would not be as harsh as feared. He also said exchanges would still have workarounds if corporate accounts are closed  Read MoreIRS says bitcoin is property rather than currency   "Our core concern is whether Bitcoin is legal.

CNBC contributor Ron Insana and Stephen Pair, BitPay CEO, discuss the argument for bitcoin as a currency and an investment.   "The historical track record of old white men who don\'t understand technology crapping on new technology is, I think, 100 percent." Marc Andreessen commenting on Warren Buffett\'s description of bitcoin as a "mirage."   As a middle-aged white man, I fall somewhere in between, age-wise, Warren Buffett and Marc Andreessen, the former is arguably the most savvy investor of the last century, the latter a very savvy tech investor of the last 20 years.   The debate over the future of bitcoin has intensified of late as some, Buffett and myself included, are doubtful that a digital currency like bitcoin is built to last, as opposed to being "bulletproof," as described by Andreessen.  Read MoreAndreessen vs. Buffet: Bitcoin miracle or mirage?   What strikes me as problematic in Marc\'s criticism of Buffett is that while Buffett fully admits that tech is not his game, more specifically, he doesn\'t believe he is capable of identifying long-term winners and losers in a rapidly evolving space, is that Andreessen ignores Buffett\'s thorough understanding of money, which bitcoin purports to be.    Just as a refresher, money is defined by having three intrinsic properties:    In the history of money, it is true that many vehicles have served those purposes ... load stones, salt, seashells, coins, bank notes, scrip, and, here at home today, Federal Reserve notes. As bitcoin strives to become a world currency that owes no allegiance to a sovereign nation, it behooves us to remember that in the modern history of money, (since the 1600s, or thereabout), there have been only three global reserve currencies \u2026 The British pound, The French franc (very briefly) and The U.S. dollar. The euro desires to take its place among the reserve currency of the world, as does the Chinese yuan, neither of which are likely to supplant the dollar anytime soon.     The U.S. dollar still accounts for over 65 percent of all global transaction volume and is not going away, even if bitcoin finds a place in the modern payments system.    Indeed, in today\'s economy, the dollar itself, is virtually a digital currency, since cash is often replaced by an electronic deposit system that automatically deposits your paycheck into your bank account and you then use those electronic dollars, via a debit card to purchase goods and services. While not a cashless society, we are well on our way to becoming one. Bitcoin an intellectual experiment: Bill Miller Bill Miller, Legg Mason fund manager, shares his thoughts on bitcoin and explains why he sees huge opportunity in the virtual currency.   The current problem with debit, and credit, cards, though, is the cost of using them. Swipe and transaction fees mean that the use of your own money costs you, and sometimes dearly, simply to withdraw funds or purchase goods.     Now, bitcoin has a noble goal of eliminating those "frictions" in the system, so that the cost of transacting business, on a bitcoin platform, is zero.   Read MoreBill Miller: I\'m a bitcion owner    Bitcoin also promotes anonymity, a feature both desirable and dangerous, at the same time.    Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that there are nefarious uses for the U.S. dollar in the drug trade, on the black market, and in other areas where secrecy is the coin of the realm, just as opponents warn of bitcoin. However, given the transparency of the U.S. banking system and increasing international coordination of "following the money," it is becoming more and more difficult for bad actors to use the banking system as a means of financing illicit acts. In our post-modern, technology-driven world, however, a world fraught with threats of terrorism facilitated by money-laundering and other illegal acts that are aided and abetted by anonymity, such discrete transactions, facilitated by cryptocurrencies, could be a danger to civil society.    The impact of that has yet to be thoroughly felt or explored.    But the real problem with launching a new currency, particularly one that is not backed by anything but algorithms, is subject to cyberattacks and cybertheft (think Mt.Gox), and could even become vaporware in the event of some global disruption to the power grid, is the "mirage\' that Buffet talked about. In the Mt.Gox case, one minute the bitcoins were there, the next, $850 million worth was gone. (A quarter of that was recently discovered in a "digital wallet," but the bulk remains "missing." As a consequence, and rather ironically, digital currency exchanges are now, reportedly, building underground vaults, maintaining physical ledgers and saving hard drives in order to ensure the safety of their digital dollars.    One should note, however that we already have such a system that safeguards gold, the dollar and the payment system, which is quite sophisticated and secure.    Let\'s call it the Federal Reserve, an institution that digital currencies shun, despite the obvious need for an overseer, guarantor and facilitator.    Fundamentally, though, to me, the most basic conceptual flaw in the creation of a cryptocurrency, however, is twofold:    1.) There is no economy, interest rate regime, nor other means of valuing the currency that allows it to maintain the required characteristics of money. As we have seen, the lack of legitimate backing has caused extraordinary swings in the value of bitcoin, the type of volatility that inhibits widespread use due to a lack of stability.   2.) Most important, though, is that governments don\'t like to give up the power to coin, or print, money. Note the recent IRS decision declaring that bitcoin is "property" and not "currency." The repercussions of this decision are manyfold and could, ultimately, kill this infant in its crib, so too the People\'s Bank of China forcing institutions to abandon dealings in bitcoin. Read MoreThis is sending bitcoin investors fleeing   I will side with Buffett on this one, old and white though he may be. What Andreessen failed to note in his criticism is that the road to technological innovation is littered with young white men who, in the 1990s, launched thousands of public companies aimed at remaking the world. Some succeeded, but many failed for the lack of respect for some time-honored tenets of how to build a business. Buffett knows money and its history. It would probably pay to listen to him.

Trading at around $585 at the start of Thursday, its price sank to around $513 by 2 p.m. London time, according to industry website Coindesk, which tracks the price against several major exchanges. This 10 percent-plus drop was attributed to a report by Chinese news site Caixin, which said the People\'s Bank of China (PBOC) had renewed its crackdown on the currency.    "(The PBoC is) requiring banks and payment companies to close all the accounts opened by the operators of websites that trade in the virtual currency by April 15," it said on Thursday.    (Read more: IRS says bitcoin is property rather than currency)    Caixin stated that it had seen the new ruling in a document the central bank\'s headquarters had recently sent to regional offices. It added that the PBoC had targeted 15 trading websites and the banks that fail to close their accounts would be punished.   These restrictions for domestics banks would effectively make the bitcoin trading websites in the country redundant unless they moved their operations abroad and dealt with foreign banks. Bobby Lee, the CEO of BTC China, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges on the globe, told Bloomberg that he hadn\'t seen any confirmation of the new ruling.  Last week, Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo reported a story along similar lines, saying that the PBoC was moving to halt all bitcoin transactions in the country by April 15. The article was later amended when the central bank itself took to its Weibo account to state that the report was untrue.   Bitcoin is a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining. Thursday\'s price slump has similarities with events back in December when local media reports suggested the country\'s central bank was ready to take a stricter stance on the cryptocurrency.

It warned that Chinese financial institutions should not trade the digital currency, adding that while it does not yet pose a threat to China\'s financial system, it carried risks.

If someone sent me a check for $100, that check is just a promise to give me dollars. When someone sends me bitcoin, it is instantly spendable in its current form.  I need not "cash a check" because bitcoin is already money. Do not think of bitcoin as a means to transfer dollars, it holds value by itself and it is highly liquid.    Bitcoin allows us to instantly send money to one another securely, without relying on a financial middleman who works bankers\' hours, charges transfer fees, and gambles with depositor\'s money with the potential to do harm to the economy and needs to be bailed out with tax dollars.     The fact is that the financial system is outdated. Thousands fall victim to credit fraud every day. Merchants who accept those cards pay 2.7 percent off the top, and banks charge anywhere from $10 to $50 for wire transfers, and transactions take days to settle. Merchants can accept bitcoin for fractions of a percent, and transactions settle in 10 minutes.  These are innovations that have will enable more people to participate in the economy.    It is also critical that we not view Mt. Gox as a failure of bitcoin. Bitcoin did not fail; its encryption was not hacked. Instead, it was a failure of the people running an exchange. The rugged beauty of the bitcoin system is that individuals are responsible for their own investments.  We do not live under the belief that someone will bail us out if something happens, so we take security on as a personal moral responsibility.  Our world is better when individuals take responsibility for themselves.    (Read more: Mind your wallet: Why the underworld loves bitcoin)    I know Mr. Buffett claims to only invests in things he understands, so I hope he will take the time to learn more about bitcoin. Bitcoin performs all the necessary functions of money. It is a unit of account, a store of value, it is easily transferable and divisible. Unlike government printed currencies, it is immune to debasement from any government that isn\'t fiscally responsible enough to pay their bills.      My generation has learned a great deal from Mr. Buffett\'s proven strategy of investing, so it is difficult to suggest that he is wrong about something.  Mr. Buffett did so much with the currency we had before, I can\'t even imagine what he will do with a currency that has these qualities.     The future is always uncertain, that is why mankind is always searching for an oracle, even though we know there is no such thing.  We can only look at what is happening around us and learn about what is possible. Bitcoin is gaining more ground than ever before and no one should dismiss the awesome power of cryptographic currency. Even if you aren\'t ready to buy, it is absolutely worth paying attention to.  Now is the time to learn.   Vance Crowe is founder of Articulate Ventures a business-consulting firm in Saint Louis, Missouri that specializes helping clients differentiate themselves.

Gox.    Internet criminals, security experts say, are attracted to bitcoin because of its stratospheric rise in value, because it\'s easier to steal than real money, and because it\'s easier to trade with other criminal elements. But, they add, bitcoin will survive the damage.    "It\'s just growing pains," says Keith Jarvis, a security researcher at Dell SecureWorks. "Bitcoin is large enough and has enough momentum behind it to survive any public relations damage from this (Mt. Gox) case or anything else."    The fall of Mt Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange which filed for bankruptcy last month after saying it lost some 850,000 bitcoins to hackers, is certainly the virtual currency\'s biggest crisis.    (Read more: This is what the future holds for bitcoin: Goldman)    But data collated by Reuters from specialist bitcoin industry websites and internet forums shows that more than 730,000 bitcoins were already missing to theft, hacking, cyber-ransom payments and other apparently criminal pursuits before Mt. Gox\'s collapse. That\'s nearly 6 percent of all bitcoins, and doesn\'t include dozens, possibly hundreds, of unreported cases of individuals who have lost bitcoins from their computers or online exchanges to hackers.    For sure, there\'s no way of telling who has these missing bitcoins, or whether they were converted to real money when the price was much lower. And of course some bitcoins may have been counted twice if criminals stole them from each other or they were put back into circulation and stolen again.    But there\'s no question that bitcoins have attracted the attention of cyber-criminals - as a currency and an asset worth stealing.   Beware malware    A study by Pat Litke and Joe Stewart of Dell SecureWorks showed that as the price of bitcoin soared beyond $1,000 last year, so did the number of viruses designed to steal bitcoins from wallets - programs that hold bitcoins on user\'s computers or smartphones. Of the 140 types of such software more than 100 appeared in the past year.    Writing such viruses, says Stewart, is easy. "There\'s no sophistication involved in the storage of bitcoin in wallets. As for malware, it\'s some of the easiest stuff to write."    Indeed, this cyber-pocket picking wasn\'t criminals\' first foray into bitcoins. Initially, they focused on using their control of large networks of infected computers - called botnets - to make their own bitcoins.    Bitcoins are created through a \'mining\' process where a computer\'s resources are used to perform millions of calculations. For a while, says Kirill Levchenko, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, criminals added malware to their botnets to turn infected computers into bitcoin miners.    (Read more: Buffett blasts bitcoin as \'mirage\': \'Stay away!\')  Bitcoin\'s uphill battle to become a currency Analysts continue to question whether bitcoin will be recognized as a currency or remain a payment mechanism. CNBC\'s Julia Wood reports.   This triggered predictions of doom for bitcoin - that the criminals would take over the mining of bitcoin through botnets and bring the whole currency crashing down. But as bitcoins become harder to mine - according to an algorithm that slows down their production the more people try to create them - this approach has proven less profitable.    In 2012-13, says Danny Huang, another researcher at the University of California, San Diego, they earned at least 4,500 bitcoins, a relatively small sum compared with the total produced. "Few botnets are mining bitcoins now," he said.    Instead, they\'ve turned to stealing them from wallets, or, more lucratively, from exchanges.    According to data compiled last year by academics Tyler Moore and Nicholas Christin, of 40 exchanges tracked 18 had closed, with customer balances wiped out in many cases - not always, they point out, due to fraud. Since then, according to public reports, more than a dozen others have been hacked.   Currency of thieves    Cyber-criminals have also made use of the ease with which bitcoins can be traded without any third party - such as a bank or online payments service like PayPal - to use it as at least one way of paying for services between themselves.    "Bitcoin made it much easier for them, because they have to trust each other even less. Even complete strangers can cooperate," said Juraj Bednar, a bitcoin security expert in Slovakia.    But while bitcoin has its advantages, it\'s not a perfect tool for the bad guys.    (Read more: Bitcoin\'s Mt.Gox disappears, insolvency feared)   Take, for example, ransomware. Viruses which encrypt users\' data and then demand payment for a key to unlock it have become increasingly sophisticated, says Dell Secureworks\' Jarvis.    The most successful: CryptoLocker, which Jarvis believes is run by a Russian-speaking gang who are also behind a botnet called Gameover Zeus that targets financial websites.    Bitcoin often appears on CryptoLocker as an option for victims to pay up. Its appeal, says Bednar, lies in the fact that it needs no third party for the transaction to work.    But there have been problems. For one thing, the type of user to be infected by a virus wasn\'t likely to be the type who is technologically savvy enough to be familiar with bitcoin. Also, as bitcoin rose in value, it has become a more expensive option for the victim, forcing the criminals to lower their bitcoin ransom demands to match prevailing exchange rates.   Tracing transactions    Then there\'s bitcoin\'s transparency. All transactions are visible, and while they\'re just digits and letters, in theory they could be connected to an individual and the entire history of all the bitcoin\'s transactions traced.    Italian computer engineer Michele Spagnuolo, for example, was able to trace a number of ransom payments for CryptoLocker. The gains have been impressive: he and academics from Politecnico di Milano speculate that up to 6,757 bitcoins - then worth around $6 million - could be linked to those behind CryptoLocker late last year. That estimate of their total takings, he says, could be very conservative.    But the fact that such payments can be traced would raise a red flag for cyber-criminals, says Daniel Cohen of RSA, the security division of EMC Corp, even though there are online services that can "launder" bitcoins to hide their origin. "Sure, there are bitcoin laundering services, but still if I tie a wallet to an identity I can see every single movement," he said.    And, ironically, the success that some criminals have had in stealing bitcoins has made it less appealing to the underworld. RSA\'s Cohen says his team monitoring underground forums has noticed criminals lately see bitcoin as "volatile, seizable and, with the recent thefts, unsafe."   Fixes needed     That\'s not to say bitcoin is out of the woods.    While the protocols underlying bitcoin have proved themselves to work, the weak links have been the software containing the wallets, whether on exchanges or on individuals\' computers.    "The attacks on the exchanges did not in themselves indicate any particular weakness of bitcoin per se, but rather exploiting vulnerabilities within the exchanges," says Raj Samani of Intel Corp\'s internet security company McAfee.    Such holes are being addressed, says Dell Secureworks\' Stewart, pointing to such innovations as hardware wallets to replace software ones. "We\'re just going to have to get into that mode of thinking," he says.    For now, bitcoin users remain a vulnerable target.    That was illustrated when hackers breached Mt. Gox\'s servers and its owner\'s blog this week to post files purporting to be Mt. Gox\'s transactions in bitcoin stretching back to 2011.    Amid the files lurked another surprise awaiting the unwary: a bitcoin-stealing virus.

CNBC\'s Jeff Cox explains.\r\n   Most industries recoil at the thought of too much regulation. Bitcoin is finding out what happens when there\'s not enough.    The cryptocurrency has been adrift in a directionless no man\'s land without rules to guide it as investors, consumers and policymakers try to figure out just what bitcoin is and is not.     Most recently, it\'s been hit with a wave of scandals and bad publicity that has seen bitcoin\'s most prominent exchange file for bankruptcy\u2014causing untold losses to those who traded at Mt.Gox\u2014while journalists hunt for bitcoin\'s creator and others wonder whether it or any other cryptocurrency can survive.    Enter, then, regulators in New York with a fairly modest plan that could be the first step toward salvation.   (Read more: Disappearing bitcoins? There\'s insurance for that)    Benjamin Lawsky, the state\'s superintendent of financial services, said earlier this week that he wants to see future exchanges operating in New York register so at least the government knows who is involved. Lawsky figures the changes to be implemented by the end of the second quarter in an effort to protect consumers and establish standards for the $8 billion industry.    "New York state\'s plans to regulate bitcoin represents the most significant crossroad in bitcoin\'s history to-date," Shai Heffetz, head of InterTrader, a U.K.-based currency trading platform, said in a statement. "Bitcoin is in its infancy; it has taken a few tumbles, but it will come out stronger. Legitimate recognition could be the first step on the way to popular acceptance of the currency and governments across the globe would be forced to follow suit."    The idea of bitcoin and regulation seems incongruous on its surface.    After all, bitcoin was created at least in part to operate outside the realm of fiat currencies whose value is set not by hard assets but by the full faith and credit of the issuer. With central banks printing trillions of these fiat currencies to stimulate the global economy\u2014with the ancillary effect of underwriting government debt\u2014advocates looked for an alternative.    (Read more: Bitcoin\'s back to the wall as it fights to survive)    However, survival will be hard to achieve without credibility.    "The public is not yet confident in digital currencies and they hear a lot of horror stories like Mt.Gox. There will be more horror stories undoubtedly," Rep. Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, said in a phone interview. "The overall trend will be growth of usage with digital currencies. While there might be brief setbacks from stories of theft or loss, those certainty haven\'t set back dollar bills."    Polis recently admonished one of his colleagues, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who called for the banning of bitcoins because they are being used in illegal transactions. Polis said government currencies are used for nefarious purposes all the time and nobody calls for banning dollars.    Generally speaking, he agrees that bitcoin could benefit from regulation, but believes care must be taken not to overstep.    (Read more: Bitcoin\'s got the \'Winkdex,\' but needs a lot more)    "It depends what they\'re doing," Polis said. "If they\'re making it harder to engage in consensual transactions, then they are not adding value. But if they are increasing consumer confidence by insuring that people who perpetrate scams are brought to justice, then they are increasing confidence."    One significant obstacle to regulating bitcoin is in determining what function it will serve.    While it\'s commonly referred to as such, it is unlikely to be considered an actual currency unless it gets the backing of a central bank. U.S. Federal Reserve officials, such as former Chairman Ben Bernanke, have said bitcoin could offer some benefits but they are unlikely to get involved.    That could leave bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, of which there are at least eight operating globally, as ways to make purchases online but not as conventional currencies.    "Cryptocurrencies in general we will see for many years to come," said Ashley Winton, an attorney who chairs the Global Privacy Group at London-based White & Case. "Whether they exist as a real currency or as payment method, we\'ll see. I\'m certainly on the side of (bitcoin as) a permanent fixture of the landscape. It may not be bitcoin, it may be bitcoin version two or many of the other currencies that exist."    (Read more: Bitcoin\'s four steps to Wall Street acceptance)    Winton said that because crypotcurrencies operate globally each country likely will have its own regulations. In the U.K., for instance, he said the rules for e-payment services likely could come into play.    Those who don\'t play by the rules could face the same treatment as Mt.Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, who faces a class-action lawsuit filed in Chicago by investors who lost their bitcoins.    Even in that case, the plaintiffs believe that the problems were specific to the exchange and not bitcoin, though better regulation could have helped prevent it, said Jay Edelson, the attorney who has brought the case. Indeed, despite all the bad publicity, bitcoin\'s price has held up fairly well, still trading in the $600-$700 range.    "All roads lead to him," Edelson said of Karpeles, whose attorney could not be reached for comment. "That being said, there is something inherent anytime you have a new investment tool where it can be easy for somebody to take advantage of a lot of people. The industry has to be regulated. There\'s too much money involved for it not to be."   \u2014By CNBC\'s Jeff Cox. Follow him on Twitter @JeffCoxCNBCcom.

CNBC\'s Julia Wood reports.   Cryptocurrency bitcoin, which has come under rising scrutiny since the recent collapse of Mt.Gox, has a much better shot as a payment mechanism than a currency, says Goldman Sachs.     "The most commonly identified properties of a successful currency are that it is: widely (if not universally) accepted as a medium of exchange (and) a stable store of value," Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a report on Tuesday.     "To achieve this, fiat currencies are generally protected by extensive regulation. They are usually recognized as legal tender; the government is generally obliged to accept them for tax payments; and the central bank is almost always the sole issuer," they added.    (Read more: Bitcoin\'s back to the wall as it fights to survive)   In terms of universal acceptance, the legal status of bitcoin differs vastly around the world. Russia, for instance, has declared the virtual currency illegal; while Germany on the other hand, has embraced it.    In Germany, bitcoin is recognized as a "unit of account", meaning it can be used for tax and trading purposes.    On the stability front bitcoin hasn\'t scored very high marks.  According to Goldman, the volatility of bitcoin prices so far has greatly exceeded the volatility of other currencies and gold.     (Read more: Why Mt.Gox collapse could ultimately help bitcoin)    Since hitting a record high of $1,240 in December, it has been on a wild ride, falling below $500 amid the troubles at Mt.Gox in late-February.

FINRA: Bitcoin is risky Quartz writer Tim Fernholz discusses FINRA\'s investor alert on bitcoin. Mt.Gox, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy on Feb. 28, saying it may have lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of the virtual coins due to hacking into its faulty computer system.    There is no obvious mechanism that ensures that bitcoin will achieve that stability, said Wilson and Ursua.     (Read more: Disappearing bitcoins? There\'s insurance for that)    "For fiat currencies, central banks are tasked specifically with preserving a relatively stable value. To do that, they are able to vary the supply of currency. But bitcoin has no equivalent authority prepared to act to guarantee the stability of its value," they said.    Wide-spread use conceivable    Nevertheless, the bank says bitcoin shows more promise in terms of its payments technology.     "Although it is not yet \'widely\' accepted, the ability to pay for goods and services using bitcoin is growing," they said.     "And the fundamental obstacles to bitcoin being used more broadly in the payments system are arguably not insurmountable, though connections with the conventional banking system are ultimately essential to its functioning," they added.     (Read more: Singapore\'s first bitcoin ATM opens for business)    The absence of derivative markets makes it harder to manage and hedge risk around bitcoin\'s value, but it is possible to imagine how those could ultimately develop, Wilson and Ursua said.     "On net, more than taking off as a widely-used alternative currency, it is much more plausible that bitcoin eventually has a significant impact in terms of its innovation on payments technology, by forcing existing players to adapt to it or coopt it," they concluded.    \u2014By CNBC\'s Ansuya Harjani.

Using bitcoin to buy companies is still a very rare occurrence at the moment: so far only a handful of firms are engaging in the process. But analysts and industry-watchers claim the rapid rise in interest in the cryptocurrency could see more companies adopt bitcoin for M&A deals.      Blockchain, a bitcoin wallet that holds accounts for users of the virtual currency, bought Zeroblock, a real-time bitcoin market data and news app, for an undisclosed sum using the cryptocurrency in December last year. This followed the sale of bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice to an unnamed buyer for $11.5m in the virtual currency in July 2013.

(Read more: Despite recent woes, \'crypto currency\' is the future, say SXSW attendees)    "Everyone is trying to make their place and the entire economy is going to get more aggressive making these deals. This space is heating up and we are not slowing down."    The space looks set to heat up further. Carey told CNBC that his company is going to announce "the largest ever bitcoin acquisition" in the "next several weeks".    \'Ponzi scheme\'?    All this fervor comes in spite of a rash of recent negative press for bitcoin -- from the mystery surrounding the identity of the creator of the virtual currency, to Mt.Gox, once the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange, filing for bankruptcy protection.     Respected economist Nouriel Roubini also launched a scathing attack on the cryptocurrency, declaring it a "Ponzi scheme" and a "lousy" store of value. The currency has been known to be susceptible to violent crashes and swings in price.    This uncertainty has led to experts warning that Bitcoin is highly unlikely to play a major role in the future of M&A deals.    "The transactions were done between bitcoin companies in this arbitrary bitcoin economy, the people buying them were some of the original actors," Michael Jackson, partner at early stage investor Mangrove Capital Partners, told CNBC in a phone interview.

CNBC\'s Jon Fortt provides insight.   Jackson added that the M&A process using bitcoin could also be complicated between companies that use the virtual currency and those that don\'t.     "If we ended up selling something with bitcoin, we would have a problem converting it in to cash. That side is not under control yet," Jackson said.   Regulatory uncertainty    Because of the way it was set up, there is also a distinct lack of formal regulation surrounding the cryptocurrency. U.S. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen suggested the central bank could not regulate it, but that Congress should examine the regulatory structure of the virtual currency.    "I\'m not sure Bitcoin really is changing the face of M&A at the moment," Richard Smith, partner at law firm Mayer Brown, told CNBC in a phone interview.

Despite this, Bitcoin companies and enthusiasts are adamant that the digital currency is here to stay in the M&A space and the recent deals are just blazing a trail that other, more established, companies will follow.

Advocates would disagree with Roubini, but even the most hardened of fans still accept that more needs to be done with this new technology. Peter Vessenes, the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, which is an organization set up to promote the digital currency, believes that bitcoin is truly "disruptive" and "engaging" but also warns of risks assocated with the currency.     "There are botnet operators, hackers, and Ponzi-scheme runners floating around our space," Vessenes states on the foundation\'s website.   Bitcoin regulation has been a hot topic since its price started to rise at the beginning of 2013. Subpoenas have been sent to several companies associated with bitcoin over the last year, sites have been shut down and arrests have even been made at some exchanges. However, it also received favorable comments by regulatory officials at a U.S. Senate hearing in November and former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder has been quoted as saying that the cryptocurrency shows "promise".    (Read more: Another bitcoin site bites the dust)    Japan last week deemed the digital cash to be more of a commodity than a currency and Thailand has moved to ban the digital currency altogether. German authorities have said it can be classed as a unit of account akin to "private money" whilst U.K. officials are busy stripping away taxes associated with the new technology.    Away from the regulatory issues, bitcoin offers a marketing tool for some companies. Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson announced that his commercial spaceflight venture would accept bitcoin as payment. Meanwhile a university in Cyprus, a sustainable grocer, a travel website, a delicatessen and a guitar repair shop are just some of the smaller businesses that have received attention online thanks to their decisions to accept the cryptocurrency.     Despite this, Roubini remains unconvinced of bitcoin\'s merits for retailers. He deemed that it would only benefit criminal activities and said those that do accept it would immediately convert it right back into a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar.

Tech executives and industry professional at South by Southwest Interactive are steadfast in the belief that virtual currency is here to stay.  "There are two questions that are important to ask. One is, what is the future of crypto-currency? And it\'s very obvious to all of us that crypto-currency is inevitable,"  said Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas at a panel at SXSWi on Friday. "There\'s a danger in having it not be regulated in some form, but people will take it and debate that as this plays out," he said.   The other question? Whether other crypto-currencies will be modeled after bitcoin, or full an as-yet-unknown model.    "Is it going to be like the Napster of crypto-currencies? I think that we don\'t know. This is still a pretty new space," he said.    Bitcoin feels more volatile right now because people are still trying to wrap their heads around the fact that it\'s bits and not paper, said Nico Sell, the CEO of the messaging app Wickr. But that mentality won\'t last forever, she added.     "The spikes are amazing right now, but bitcoin is one many virtual currencies. These currencies are 100 percent the future, but we are in the beginning of figuring this all out, but crypto currency is stronger than paper, but we are early on in the process," Sell said.

But that\'s not proving be the case. Not everyone who believes in currencies backed by gold believes in bitcoin.    "The main problem with bitcoin is it doesn\'t solve the problem of fiat money," said Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital and a staunch defender of gold. "You have no store of value in bitcoin because there\'s no value to store."    The endorsement of bitcoin by marquee investors like Richard Branson, the Winklevoss twins and Marc Andreessen has done little to assuage skeptics who doubt bitcoin\'s potential as a long-term complement or competitor to gold.   (Read more: Head of virtual currency exchange found dead in Singapore)    In addition to its lack of security and its short history, Schiff argued that for the virtual currency to rival gold or regular money, it would need to be widely accepted as a form of payment. The government would also have to see it as a store of value, something that hasn\'t happened yet.    "If you want to open it up to the masses, you have to make it acceptable to the government. But that sacrifices everything that makes the currency attractive" including its anonymity, he said.     Bitcoin "is not an efficient payment system," Schiff said, other than to those he derided as "Libertarian techno-geeks. It\'s tulip mania 2.0," he said, referencing the notorious 17th century speculative bubble in flowers that took place in Holland. Schiff said he believes the same fate awaits the cryptocurrency in a matter of years.  One thing is certain: Bitcoin has seen vertigo-inducing volatility. Last year, the currency surged to a record high above $1,100, only to crash below $500 in the wake of the collapse of Mt.Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange. Late last week, the cryptocurrency flirted with $700.  On most policy topics, gold standard advocates still agree more than they disagree, especially when it comes to monetary policy and the perils of deficit spending.  Still, if it\'s not yet leading to a full-fledged schism, bitcoin has at least prompted a sharp debate between the old guard and the new.  (Read more: \'Real\' bitcoin creator: \'I am not Dorian Nakamoto\')   The cryptocurrency\'s enthusiasts, such as Austin Alexander of the Bitcoin Center in New York City, say with time and greater credibility, bitcoin can be more widely adopted. Traditionalists, he added, are fixated on "gold, gold and nothing but gold."    It will take years, Alexander said, for bitcoin "to compare to something like gold, which has had thousands of years of [convertibility], to develop into a mature payment mechanism." Bitcoin mystery deepens Satoshi Nakamoto denies he is the founder of bitcoin after Newsweek tracked him down, reports CNBC\'s Becky Quick.   Steve H. Hanke, professor of applied economics at The Johns Hopkins University and a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed to bitcoin\'s volatility and lack of security. He called it "the speculative asset of the century."     Hanke, who directs the Troubled Currencies Project for Johns Hopkins and Cato, views the virtual currency\'s popularity as more computer science than economic theory. He said supporters were "computer geek" dilettantes with little appreciation for the historical evolution of currency.    "The ignorance of money is phenomenal," Hanke said, adding that bitcoin\'s biggest champions are "Silicon Valley kind of guys. None of this crowd has a clue about money and banking."    (Read more: Bitcoin\'s back to the wall as it fights to survive)    Although he considers himself bullish on electronic money, Hanke thinks bitcoin is too volatile\u2014and its open-source code too insecure\u2014to function as a challenger to fiat currencies.    "The wave of the future is virtual currencies, but as a means of transaction" like PayPal, credit and debit cards, said Hanke, who argued that a stable currency must be linked to a physical commodity to ward off hyperinflation.

An online social account for the creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, sprung back into life Friday morning after a five-year hibernation amid growing speculation about his identity.    The username Satoshi Nakamoto used an online forum for the P2P Foundation - an organization that studies peer to peer technology - to introduce the virtual currency with a single post back in 2009. The same user returned on Friday morning in an attempt to deny a 4,500-word cover story in this week\'s Newsweek  magazine.    Newsweek claimed that the creator of bitcoin was a 64-year old Japanese-American living in California called Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto. But Friday\'s comment on the P2P Foundation website - using the Satoshi Nakamoto username - simply stated: "I am not Dorian Nakamoto."   This denial comes after news agency AP reported on Thursday that Dorian Nakamoto - whose birth name was Satoshi Nakamoto - had rebutted claims that he had anything to do with bitcoin. However, he did acknowledge that many of the details in Newsweek\'s report were correct.    On Friday, the magazine issued a statement strongly defending the story and the work of its writer, Leah McGrath-Goodman.   "Ms. Goodman\'s reporting was motivated by a search for the truth surrounding a major business story, absent any other agenda," Newsweek said in a post on its website. "The facts as reported point toward Mr. Nakamoto\'s role in the founding of bitcoin."     (Read more: Japanese native denies being bitcoin founder)    Reporters camped outside Dorian Nakamoto\'s house on Thursday before Nakamoto appeared from his two-story home in the early afternoon. Speaking to reporters on his doorstep he said that he was not involved in bitcoin and opted to travel with a reporter from the AP for a "free lunch".    "I\'m not involved in bitcoin. Wait a minute, I want my free lunch first. I\'m going with this guy," Nakamoto said pointing to the reporter, according to Reuters.    The media followed Nakamoto as he travelled by car to a nearby sushi restaurant, before leaving and heading downtown. Los Angeles Times reporter Joe Bel Bruno followed the pair and described the incident as a "bitcoin chase" in a running stream of tweets.   (Read more: How to make money from bitcoin)    "OK Nakamoto is in a Prius. He could really drive for days without filling up. This could last forever," he said in one of his tweets.          Satoshi Nakamoto has caused much debate in the bitcoin community since releasing his white paper on the virtual currency back in 2009. His software protocol was the foundations for the cryptocurrency that is used worldwide today. Bitcoin has received international attention in recent years with the price soaring over $1,000 in November. It\'s a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.

There is still some disagreement whether Satoshi is one person - whether male or female - or in fact a group of people and this latest comment on the P2P Foundation did little to quash any rumors. Waller told CNBC that he believes that the fresh comment on Friday was by an administrator at the P2P Foundation wanting to "take the heat off" of Dorian Nakamoto.

Arthur Nakamoto, the bitcoin creator\'s brother, told Newsweek that the developer was a brilliant man who had worked "on classified stuff,"  yet used a vulgar term to describe his personality. Ironically, the brother told the magazine that Nakamoto would likely "deny everything. He\'ll never admit to starting bitcoin."  (Read more: How can you make money with bitcoin?)

CNBC\'s Julia Wood reports.   Bitcoin has been one of the hottest topics of the past year -- in 2013 its value rose more than fiftyfold. But while the conversation around the cryptocurrency has varied from price volatility to its legitimacy, many overlooked bitcoin\'s key innovation: the "block chain."   The block chain is a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. Transactions are verified on a peer-to-peer network when computers running bitcoin software \u2013 or "nodes" \u2013 reach a consensus, which prevents double spending or forgery. The block chain is the key to keeping bitcoin transparent, decentralized and secure; it ensures that everyone holding bitcoins has an exact copy of this ledger and that all transactions are recognized and verified by the peer-to-peer network.    (Read more: Bitcoin steps up from sandwiches to villas)   More importantly -- the block chain removes the need for a third-party.    Bitcoin allows for the transfer of money without using a third-party intermediary. Through the block chain the decentralized peer-to-peer network verifies the transaction without imposing hefty transaction fees.    "As far as I know, the block chain is the only method to achieve global consensus which isn\'t based on trust [of an external organization]," said Alex Mizrahi, founder and lead developer of ChromaWallet.    "History shows that even entities which are seen as being trustworthy -- banks, governments -- can sometimes turn to deception as they have interests of their own or can fall victim to some kind of attack. So the block chain can succeed where other approaches fail," he said.   Secure communication    While the financial implications of cutting out third-party intermediaries and reducing fees are appealing, the block chain has more to offer.    Bitmessage, for instance, allows users to send messages over a secure network by using a peer-to-peer communications protocol similar to bitcoin\'s transaction and block transfer system. Messages sent using the protocol are encrypted, while users sending the messages are masked and cannot be emulated or hacked. The system offers a more secure alternative to traditional e-mail platforms, and could protect against snooping or spying like that undertaken by the National Security Agency.    (Read more: Back to work at bitcoin\'s embattled Mt.Gox)    Twister, a peer-to-peer microblogging platform based on similar protocols, helps prevents censorship, while end-to-end encryption on direct messages prevents spying.   Smart property    Another use of the block chain would be smart property. The concept of applying a secondary value to bitcoins through colored "coins" is being developed for this purpose.  Breaking down the bitcoin vehicle Rik Willard, MintCombine CEO, discusses his bitcoin philosophy and how banks are beginning to educate themselves on the bitcoin "platform."   ChromaWallet is working on software that uses the colored coin concept. According to Mizrahi, the central idea behind smart property is that the current owner can be identified through the blockchain. The benefit would be the elimination of paperwork and the use of third parties in various situations where contracts are required.    He gives the example of a secondary market for time shares: "As far as I know, in many cases people have to conduct transactions through a broker, who has a lot of control, thus this market can be rigged" he told CNBC.    "If timeshare ownership were represented using colored coins, it would make transactions directly between individuals possible, thus making this market more open. And this means better price discovery and greater confidence, as people will see that they aren\'t overpaying for these timeshares," he added.    (Read more: Mind your wallet: why the underworld loves bitcoin)    Ethereum, another cryptographic ledger, offers a platform and programming language that goes beyond the concept of the block chain so that just about anything can be decentralized, secured and traded: voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowd funding, company governance, contracts, intellectual property, and even smart property.    What are the hurdles?    With many people still trying to wrap their heads -- and become confident in using -- bitcoin, widespread adoption of applications that incorporate the block chain is unlikely. Until then, developers may need to aim for creating better user experiences according to Mike Hearn, a bitcoin developer.  Bitcoin or banks safer for money transfers? Discussing the security for bitcoin, and its exchanges, with Jaron Lukasiewicz, Coinsetter founder & CEO.   "I think right now we need to establish better documentation and best practices. A lot of people experimenting in this space produce apps with poor user experiences, probably because they don\'t know how to make better ones. I\'m hoping some examples here will raise the bar and light the way," he told CNBC.    Another issue, according to ChromaWallet\'s Mizrahi, is that all nodes need to verify transactions regardless of their size, which is potentially inefficient.    "When someone buys a cup of coffee, he doesn\'t really need full power of a decentralized, trustless network," he said. "We need to design a solution which would let small transactions to be processed without burdening the decentralized network."

Yet in a note dated March 11th, Goldman Sachs analysts acknowledged that "more than taking off as a widely-used alternative currency, it is much more plausible that bitcoin eventually has a significant impact in terms of its innovation on payments technology, by forcing existing players to adapt to it or coopt it."    However, the same note highlighted concerns about maintaining the block chain as it grows in size: "Whether maintenance of the block chain by the mining community will remain a reasonable task is also in doubt given the rapidly increasing length of the block chain, which increased to nearly 15 GB from 10 GB in just six months, and the rising complexity of it as it splits."   \u2014 By CNBC\'s John Phillips.

That\'s been a huge problem lately as two exchanges recently have shut down due to hacker attacks, drawing unwanted headlines and adding fuel to detractors who believe cryptocurrencies are untrustworthy stores of wealth.    Enter Falcon Global Capital, a San Diego firm launching a fund this month that will offer investors access to insurance should their bitcoins suddenly disappear, as they have for other unfortunate believers operating in the Mt.Gox or Flexcoin exchanges.    That insurance comes through London-based Elliptic, which is willing to stand strongly enough behind bitcoin that it will offer reimbursement for those subjected to theft or other circumstances.   (Read more: Another bitcoin site bites the dust)    Elliptic touts its bitcoin "vault" that reportedly is insured by Lloyd\'s of London. Should a hacker strike or other security breach cause a loss of bitcoins, they will be insured at that day\'s bitcoin price, which will be determined through a proprietary index.    "We offer simplicity, security and transparency," Falcon co-founder Brett P. Stapper said in an interview. "We feel if we can take care of these three things it will be beneficial for our company as well as investors getting into bitcoin."    The size and the scope of the Falcon fund are a little sketchy at this point\u2014as one might assume from a start-up delving into the relatively unexplored frontier of cryptocurrencies. Twin investors Cameron and Kyle Winklevoss, who had a well-publicized hand in developing Facebook, are proposing a bitcoin exchange-traded fund that remains under regulatory review.    Stapper said he\'s received "inquiries" from investors looking to dedicate $10 million for what will be a passively managed fund dedicated exclusively to bitcoin, and the target is for $100 million in assets after six months.    Providing insurance, he believes, will counter the negative headlines, particularly from the Mt.Gox crash, that have called into question bitcoin\'s viability.    (Read more: Bitcoin\'s back to the wall as it fights to survive)    A statement on the Elliptic site explains the approach and the firm\'s stance toward the recent issues:    Problems at Mt.Gox have justifiably caused concern amongst Bitcoin holders around the world. Elliptic Vault maintains all customer funds in segregated, transparent, externally auditable storage. Every customer is able to verify the balance of their account through the blockchain, independently of our service.     Recent events have highlighted the need for proper, accountable storage for people\'s Bitcoin holdings\u2014something that Elliptic has always understood to be important. Without transparent, full-reserve storage, or the peace of mind that comes from insurance protection, people are always taking a risk when leaving their funds in third-party hands. Elliptic wishes to underline the fact that it provides both transparency and insurance-backing to customers of our Vault service.    Elliptic did not respond to a request for further comment.    Generally speaking, Stapper remains optimistic about bitcoin, a view apparently shared as the price has continued to climb since the Mt.Gox debacle.    "I truly believe in the technology behind bitcoin. That\'s how I can justify the thinking that the price will dramatically rise," Stapper said. "The technology, the platform, the protocols behind bitcoin are truly revolutionary if people can understand them."    Still, the broader investing public may need more convincing that bitcoin is trustworthy.    Making that happen could be the job of regulators, who currency experts believe will step in soon and take a closer look at how to protect bitcoin owners from future breakdowns.    (Read more: Bitcoin\'s got the \'Winkdex,\' but needs a lot more)    "Bitcoin desperately needs regulation as soon as possible," said Judith Rinearson, a partner at the Bryan Cave law firm in New York who testified in February at the state\'s Department of Financial Services public hearing on virtual currencies. "Their credibility is going to be more and more at issue."    Rinearson compared bitcoin to the introduction of prepaid debit and credit cards back in the 1990s, when skeptics said they would be susceptible to criminals and wouldn\'t last. She anticipates that bitcoin, too, ultimately will be looked at not as a currency but as a payment system, similar to Western Union but considerably less expensive.    That would require bitcoin exchanges engaging in compliance programs, registration as a money transmitter and submitting to best-practice guidelines.    "What\'s most important is that banks, consumers and merchants need the comfort, especially after all this bad news, of understanding where bitcoin fits in our regulated world of payments," Rinearson said. "Once the powers that be figure this out ... I would like to see bitcoin survive for my children and grandchildren. I really do think it\'s a good product."   \u2014By CNBC\'s Jeff Cox.

"There\'s a lot of really good news coming out that\'s not getting attention," said Austin Alexander, deputy director of The Bitcoin Center in New York.

Rather than filing for bankruptcy on Friday, the company opted for "bankruptcy protection,"  a Chapter 11-style civil rehabilitation that gives the company time to reorganize its affairs with lawyers treating it as an ongoing concern.    Despite detailing that it had outstanding debts of about 6.5 billion Japanese yen ($63.6 million), 850,000 lost bitcoins and 127,000 empty-handed customers, the exchange said it was looking to continue doing business so it could start repaying its creditors.

Mt.Gox reiterated on Monday that it believed nearly $500 million worth of bitcoin may have been lost. It blamed the disappearance on a bug in bitcoin\'s framework called "transaction malleability." This means that while users were receiving incomplete transaction messages when using the exchange, in reality bitcoins may have been illicitly moved by hackers out of their accounts.    And it\'s not just its missing bitcoins that Mt.Gox is investigating. The company said that it had found large discrepancies between the amount of cash it holds in financial institutions and the amount deposited by its users.

Venture capitalist Ezra Galston writes in The Wall Street Journal, "Without a regulatory framework, credible payment processors\u2014such as PayPal, Dwolla or Square\u2014cannot service bitcoin exchanges.

Gox files for bankruptcy)    Hundreds of bitcoin supporters have tweeted attacks at me for arguing that it is not real money. But historically, money must be a reliable medium of exchange and a reliable store of value. Bitcoin meets neither of these definitions.     How can you transact using so-called digital money when prices fluctuate by hundreds of dollars in the space of an hour, or less? You might think you bought something for $500. But by the time the retailer processes payment, the so-called digital-currency price drops to $100.     Both buyers and sellers lose big because bitcoin is not a reliable medium of exchange with a dependable store of value. It is backed by nothing but pure speculation. You can\'t even hedge it, because there\'s no interest rate. You can barely even get a price quote\u2014not for the value of the product being bought or sold, but for the value of the monetary medium of exchange.     Years ago, Arthur Laffer warned that many currencies around the world lacked "the moneyness of money." He was referring to third-world-type currencies. But bitcoin would qualify, as well.

And maybe future bitcoin reformers can restructure in such a way. But the dollar is accepted around the world by governments, banks, businesses and consumers because it is a reliable medium of exchange, even if its store of value has deteriorated.     The dollar serves as a payment mechanism, has a central issuer and is regulated. When the bitcoin people created their digital money as a way of avoiding banks and regulators, they forgot, or maybe never learned, the classic day-to-day requirements of a currency.     So fellas, please go back to the drawing board. I\'m all for the digital revolution and trading assets online. But money is different. It must conform to certain long-held principles.

Gox said on Friday it had lost up to half a billion dollars of investor funds, including some of his own. "But we didn\'t ban automobiles."    Shishido, who lives in Tokyo, was one of about 10,000 investors in Japan who became creditors in Mt.

Gox\'s loss is eye-popping but so too is the number of creditors - 127,000 - in what had been the world\'s biggest exchange.

Plaintiff Gregory Greene filed a complaint on behalf of bitcoin users in a U.S. District Court in Chicago on Thursday, accusing Mt.

Mt.Gox are expected to update customers via its website which has published two updates since being taken offline.    (Track the price of bitcoin here)    Angus McFadyen, an associate at international law firm Pinsent Masons told CNBC via telephone that he expected the company will now disappear. Bankruptcy protection aims to give a company time to reorganize its affairs while treating it as an ongoing concern. McFadyen explained that if formal bankruptcy is filed, then a long list of creditors will be drawn up, with each lodging their claims before being placed in a queue.     Tax authorities will be at the top of the list, he said, with unsecured creditors - which he believes to be the bitcoin investors - being at the bottom. If the money available to the company, if any, stretches to the unsecured creditors then they may be reimbursed. He didn\'t expect this to happen in the case of Mt.Gox however.    In other jurisdictions, like the U.K., the directors at a company could be made to help with reimbursement if they are complicit, but McFadyen didn\'t expect this to happen with this particular incident, with the loss blamed instead on computer thieves.    (Read More: Mt.Gox customers could be out of luck, experts warn)   "As it stands bitcoin doesn\'t benefit from any laws," McFadyen told CNBC, explaining that because it was a decentralized currency with no regulation it is not given the same protection as fiat currency. "A currency needs to be secure and customers need to have confidence with it," he added.    Another global law firm told CNBC that the chances of customers getting their investments back were very slim.    "As I understand it these bitcoins have been stolen - due to anonymity of bitcoin it is difficult to see how customers could get them back," Richard Smith, a partner at Mayer Brown said.    "They may theoretically have some sort of a claim against Mt.Gox but it doesn\'t look like that would count for much if Mt.Gox is insolvent with outstanding debts of about 6.5 billion (Japanese) yen."    \u2014By CNBC.com\'s Matt Clinch; Follow him on Twitter @mattclinch81 ', 'publisher': 'CNBC', 'author': {'twitterurl': u'http://twitter.com/mattclinch81', 'name': u'Matt Clinch', 'twitterhandle': u'mattclinch81'}, 'url': 'http://www.cnbc.com/2014/02/28/a-user-just-filed-the-first-lawsuit-against-mt-gox.html', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 28, 8, 25, 47, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -18000)), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'A user just filed the first lawsuit against Mt.

The Tembusu ATM, which accepts as little as S$2 (US$1.50), dispenses a piece of paper with a QR code. The code can be scanned by a mobile app, after which bitcoins are deposited into the user\'s account. Customers are charged a 5 percent transaction fee.    "Right now, there around 30 outlets \u2013 ranging from food stalls to electronics shops - in Singapore that accept bitcoins, and the amount of usage is going up," said Peter Peh Sik Wee, managing partner at Tembusu.

However, customers cannot deposit bitcoins in exchange for cash yet -- but the company says this function should soon be added. Tembusu aims to install around 100 machines in retail outlets across the island by the year-end.

The struggles raise questions about whether this is the point where the cryptocurrency fades into cybernerd hobbyist oblivion, as many of its detractors have long suggested, or goes forward as a true alternative to global currencies.   Currency experts say this doesn\'t have to be a death knell, but it will be up to bitcoin\'s brightest brains to rebuild the infrastructure so confidence can return.    "This is a threat to bitcoin and digital currencies on the whole because it is something that could erode the trust in the overall idea," said Chris Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX. "There\'s no liquidity in the bitcoin market. There\'s no more trading activity. Quite frankly, it speaks to a problem with this whole idea of bitcoin as a unit of wealth."   Bitcoin\'s nightmare began a week ago with word that its most prominent exchange, Mt.Gox, which formerly served as a trading platform for playing cards in Magic: The Game, had experienced a technical problem and wasn\'t allowing customers to cash in their bitcoins.    Since then, negative headlines have piled up, with Tuesday bringing statements from Mt.Gox reaffirming that it wasn\'t conducting further transactions.

Some backers went on the offensive, contending that governments and others in the currency establishment were out to get bitcoin.   "The currency wars are becoming fierce and bloody," Shai Heffetz, managing director at InterTrader, a currency trading platform, said in a statement. "Bitcoin and other alternative currencies are beginning to be perceived as viable alternatives to fiat currencies. As bitcoin cannot be manipulated by any government, global powers are starting to show their concern and beginning a crackdown."    Whether bitcoin can overcome its myriad obstacles, though, became even murkier with the Mt.Gox debacle.    "Eventually, the so-called cryptocurrencies\u2014electronic tokens that pass irretrievably from buyers to seller\u2014will become extinct," said Jessica Einhorn, resident senior advisor at Rock Creek Group, a Washington.-based hedge fund, writing in Tuesday\'s Financial Times. "But for now they serve a real public purpose as an instrument of reform."    (Read more: Mt.Gox goes offline - Is bankruptcy next?)    That reform could help trigger changes in the vast and expensive system of global payments, but bitcoin will need more to survive.    If it wants to avoid extinction, the system will have to show it can be trusted and is not easily susceptible to the hackers who would love to get their hands on the $6.3 billion or so of dollar wealth tied up in bitcoins.    "The good news is there are still a lot of bitcoin multi-multi-millionaires out there. They understand the need to invest in the system," Colas said.

Meanwhile, several other major exchanges from the bitcoin community released a joint statement on Monday, trying to restore confidence in the digital currency and distance themselves from the troubled Japan-based exchange. The statement initially  featured details regarding the insolvency of Mt.Gox but were later removed.     "As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today. Mt.Gox has confirmed its issues in private discussions with other members of the bitcoin community," it said.    Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, one of the exchanges responsible for the statement, said it had been changed because of a lack of "verifiable evidence" by the organizations, even though he believed that it had reliable information to suggest that Mt.Gox was insolvent. Technology blog Re/code reported that a spokesperson for the group had confirmed that Mt.Gox "will file bankruptcy in private discussions with other members of the bitcoin community."

CNBC\'s Jeff Cox explains. Bitcoin probably will need more than a little Winklevoss buzz to restore the cachet it has lost through some high-profile embarrassments.    The online cryptocurrency could use some good news after its main trading exchange essentially went dark recently and the arrests that have piled up for people using bitcoin for nefarious purposes.    In walked the Winklevoss twins\u2014Cameron and Tyler\u2014this week with an index designed to bring some pricing stability to a product that has had little since it took off in popularity in 2013.    The bitcoin community verdict: Meh.   "It doesn\'t matter, not right now," said Nick Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx and arguably the first Wall Street analyst to pay bitcoin any mind. "Bitcoin\'s got to resolve what\'s going on with the infrastructure."    Indeed, bitcoin\'s problems have been twofold: tremendous volatility that has seen the price swing above $1,000 and down into the low hundreds, as well as internal plumbing that saw the system\'s primary exchange, Mt.Gox, essentially shut down and say it will not honor withdrawals until it fixes problems that it has blamed on a security breach.    Bitcoin is traded on online exchanges and created by "miners" who solve complex math puzzles. It has gained in acceptance as a form of payment but continues to suffer growing pains.    (Read more: Bitcoin investor fury at Mt Gox delays)    To address the volatility issue, the Winklevosses have created what they call the "Winkdex," which aggregates prices from various exchanges to determine a midpoint. On Thursday afternoon the price hovered in the $580 range, itself a 5 percent decline from the previous 24 hours, and ranged from $730 on localbtcUSD to $120 on Mt.Gox.    Colas said having a central index is all well and good but doesn\'t address some problems plaguing bitcoin.    "There still is some fairly strong organic demand for the currency," he said. "Having your biggest exchange basically implode is not good news. I don\'t think of it as an existential threat, but it is a serious black eye."    Getting such a high-profile name like the Winklevoss twins\u2014famous for the role in the development of Facebook\u2014involved might help from a public relations standpoint. But in the sometimes-shadowy bitcoin community, there is skepticism.

"If it\'s a great index, the proof will be in the pudding. In our anarchist opinion, if ain\'t broke it doesn\'t need fixing."    As for the Winklevoss involvement, Wilson said they have "egg on their face" after the arrest of Charlie Shrem, head of BitInstant who was charged in January with using bitcoin to launder money. The twins had invested $1.5 million in Shrem\'s company.    "My suspicion is everyone who tries to bring in precursor regulatory mechanisms is out for themselves and a reputational advantage, when bitcoin doesn\'t really need that kind of help," he said.    (Read more: Bitcoin\'s four steps to Wall Street acceptance)    The Winklevosses did not respond to a request for comment.  Charles Allen, CEO at Bitcoin Shop, said he hopes those inside the industry can straighten out the problems before regulators are called in to do it for them.   "The big thing that will take the volatility out of the market is when people stop looking at bitcoin as an investment," Allen said.

Like any other sectors, Wall Street has had its fair share of good, bad and ugly leaders. But their influence reaches far beyond the Street, says John Longo, a professor at Rutgers Business School.    Jamie Dimon is currently the top Wall Streeter in the CNBC 25 voting. The often blunt CEO of JPMorgan Chase rose up the ranks of Wall Street and, after being ousted from Citigroup by former CEO Sandy Weill, later went on to the top job at JPMorgan and is credited with leading the bank through the financial crisis relatively unscathed compared to other banks. Of course, it hasn\'t been all smooth sailing: Dimon has navigated JPMorgan through the "London whale" trading debacle, a lawsuit over mortgage-backed securities and a lawsuit over the bank\'s ties with Bernie Madoff. But, the head of America\'s biggest bank is still regarded as one of the best executives today, Longo said.   "Whether it\'s due to coincidence or due to his skill, there\'s been a tale of two cities between Citi and JP Morgan," he said. Dimon "was forced out of Citi, and Citi was ultimately near bankruptcy while JP Morgan thrived."   (Read more: Jamie Dimon vs. Sandy Weill: Who is more influential?) Weill is also among the bankers in contention for CNBC\'s most influential of the past 25 years, along with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, former Goldman CEO and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and former Bank of America CEO Hugh McColl. CNBC 25 faceoff: Sandy Weill vs. Jamie Dimon CNBC\'s Kayla Tausche and Kate Kelly take a  look at two of Wall Street\'s legendary bankers,  former Citigroup CEO and Chairman Sandy Weill and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.    Beyond banking, other Wall Streeters on the list include Charles Schwab, who revolutionized asset management.    Schwab, who launched the discount brokerage that bears his name in 1971, is seen as a pioneer of do-it-yourself investing. The California native has made money management easier and more accessible for investors by rolling out services like online trading and no-commission exchange-traded funds.    Other investment managers on the list include Vanguard founder Jack Bogle and Fidelity leaders Ned and Abigail Johnson.

Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.   "Going back 25 years ago, the term \'corporate raider\' was a bad term. Now you have \'activist investor,\' which is a positive term," Longo said. "It\'s a relatively new dynamic."     Among the most famous is Carl Icahn, who\'s had a strong presence on the Street for decades. Icahn started taking positions in individual companies during the late \'70s and has shaken up quite a number of corporations throughout his career: Nabisco, Viacom, Western Union, Time Warner, Dell, Netflix, Marvel. The list goes on.

Icahn\'s Twitter feed alone may be a testament to his influence; he lifts and plunges stocks with just 140 characters.     It doesn\'t look like Icahn, currently in fifth place among Wall Streeters in the CNBC 25 voting, is going anywhere soon. His current campaigns include pushing eBay to sell off its PayPal business. Though the billionaire investor recently backed down from his fight with Apple for a stock buyback, he still may have won the battle; CEO Tim Cook announced Apple repurchased $14 billion of its shares.     Josh Brown, a financial advisor and blogger of The Reformed Broker, says it may even be worthwhile to look further than the Street for its forces of influence.

"In addition to the technical issue, this week we have experienced some security problems, and as a result we had to relocate Mt Gox to our previous of\ufb01ce building in Shibuya," it said.

Bitcoin had traded above $1,200 at its peak back in November but has since halved in price.    The Mt Gox breakdown has caused anger in the bitcoin community with customers taking to social media to express their dissatisfaction amid rumors that the company could be concealing financial difficulties.    Ezra Galston, a venture capitalist at Chicago Ventures, wrote an editorial on the bitcoin community news website CoinDesk this week, saying he believed that the current situation and recent statements belie transparency and suggest insolvency for Mt Gox.     Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal asked Mt Gox chief executive Mark Karpeles on Monday about the company\'s solvency or protection for customers\' funds. Karpeles replied that the matter is "confidential" adding that company had discussed its business model with Japanese authorities "to ensure that we are operating within the law here."    The Japanese company - which started as an online exchange for Magic The Gathering trading cards - has been described as the "original" bitcoin exchange by fans of the digital currency and once claimed it handled around 80 percent of all global dollar trades for bitcoin.    It is currently the second-biggest bitcoin exchange in the world - representing around 25 percent of total bitcoin trade in the last week, according to Bitcoinity.org.

Two Mt Gox customers, including former software developer Kolin Burges, have traveled to Japan in the hope of retrieving their bitcoins and finding out more details of the trading halt.    Burges told CNBC via telephone that there had been implications that the protest had been the reason for Mt Gox\'s move, with an angry landlord threatening to expel the company. However, Burges said he didn\'t believe this to be the case and considered that the company may have been the subject of a more formal physical threat from users with large deposits at Mt Gox.     "Nobody is really sure of what is going on," he said. "I have seen a couple of large security guards at the offices all day today."

After months of hype and hysteria that have driven up its price at a dizzying pace, Bitcoin recently encountered several hurdles that are likely to determine whether it makes it out of its early speculative phase to become a currency that people actually use, is supplanted by a rival or falls apart altogether.    The most fundamental threat was a bug in some basic software that determines how Bitcoins are moved between digital accounts. That forced several of the largest Bitcoin exchanges to shut down for most of last week and raised questions about the sturdiness of the programming underlying the currency.    At the same time, the system proved vulnerable to a hacking attack, creating doubts about the strength of the network\'s security. Regulators also indicated last week that they were moving ahead with new rules for virtual currencies, leading to some fears that burdensome laws could halt Bitcoin in its tracks.   More from The New York Times: At Newark Airport, the Lights Are On, and They\'re Watching You From India, Proof That a Trip to Mars Doesn\'t Have to Break the Bank The Untouchable Profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac    These worries sent the price of Bitcoin swinging between a high of about $700 last Monday and a low of $530 on Friday, with some expecting even bigger declines. The current prices are down from highs of about $1,200 in December.    "We are at this inflection point where the hard questions are being asked and will hopefully soon be answered," Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State\'s top financial regulator, said in an interview.    (Read more: Bitcoin exchange to resume withdrawals after slump)   Bitcoin has already survived several bouts of volatility that were even wilder than the one last week. But during those crises, nearly everyone involved was a speculator and the currency was much further from real-world success. Now that Silicon Valley and Wall Street have begun to buy in, and everyday uses for Bitcoin are becoming more common, the stakes are much higher.    In the same week that Bitcoin was besieged by hackers, Overstock.com, one of the largest companies to accept Bitcoin as payment, said it was nearing $1 million in purchases made with the currency.    Mr. Lawsky has been leading efforts to write regulations for virtual currencies, in part to improve confidence in the system. At an all-day event last Tuesday at the New America Foundation, a nonprofit public policy institute, Mr. Lawsky said he hoped to "put forward, during the course of 2014, a proposed regulatory framework for virtual currency firms operating in New York."    The same day, Canada\'s finance minister, Jim Flaherty, announced his plan to create national rules for what has been a largely lawless space.    These efforts are more encouraging for Bitcoin\'s future than Russia\'s recent decision to declare virtual currencies illegal. But the Bitcoin Financial Association started a petition to Mr. Lawsky titled "Please Do Not Regulate Bitcoin," in which it argued that Bitcoin was too young and vulnerable to be able to survive significant regulations.    (Read more: CEO of bitcoin exchange arrested)    Other supporters, however, have recently been pressing for closer cooperation with both regulators and banks.    One of the most contentious efforts by some Bitcoin entrepreneurs has been a proposal to tag the digital coins to make it possible to determine if a particular coin had been used for illegal activities.    Such a system would make banks more comfortable in handling Bitcoin transactions. But the effort has faced intense opposition from early Bitcoin adopters who were drawn to the virtual currency because it allowed them to avoid scrutiny from governments and banks.    This is only one of the disputes dividing the community of Bitcoin supporters. The winners will determine whether the virtual currency will simply be absorbed into the existing financial system or whether it will remain a new tool for people who want to circumvent the government and Wall Street, occasionally for illegal purposes like buying drugs or weapons.    Susan Athey, a professor of economics at Stanford Business School, pointed to several potential outcomes. It is possible, she said, that banks will simply adopt some of the best elements of the Bitcoin program that allow money to be transferred almost instantaneously. Other alternative virtual currencies could also rise up without Bitcoin\'s perceived flaws, like the limit on the number of Bitcoins that can ever be created.    Professor Athey is assuming that "some of each of these things happen," she said.    "Once you look at it," she added, "you say, \'How is it we are still using these archaic financial rails?\' " Is bitcoin as big as the internet? CNBC\'s Julia Wood and Bernard Lo discuss comments by venture capitalist Fred Wilson, who compared the innovation of bitcoin to the Internet.   But if Bitcoin is to have any chance of success, its digital architecture is going to have to prove its sturdiness under increasingly difficult conditions.    The most recent doubts were raised when a Bitcoin exchange that was once the largest in the world, Mt. Gox, almost shut down completely after discovering that customers could make transactions disappear from its records.    While this initially appeared to be a problem limited solely to Mt. Gox, it spread to several other large exchanges, and the Bitcoin Foundation acknowledged that it was a flaw that developers had long been aware of. With the issue out in the open, hackers began an attack on the main exchanges.    All of this put the developers who work on Bitcoin\'s open-source computer code into a frenzy of programming. The chief scientist at the foundation, Gavin Andresen, posted his activity on Twitter on Thursday: "Today was about ignoring people and Deep Coding."    By Friday, it appeared that the problem was largely under control, and the largest exchange, Bitstamp, reopened. That helped the price of a Bitcoin rise to $660 on Friday evening from $532 in the morning.    (Read more: Lew: Dimon and I share \'incredulity\' on bitcoin)    Jeff Garzik, one of the currency\'s longtime developers, said that the problems exposed last week should not be a long-term issue for the network. But he acknowledged that Bitcoin would still face significant tests.    "We\'re still a very young ecosystem," said Mr. Garzik, who now works for the Bitcoin company Bitpay. "I\'m certain that bigger and much more devastating attacks will occur in Bitcoin\'s lifetime. That\'s the nature of the beast."    Mr. Garzik expressed his confidence in Bitcoin\'s ability to survive attacks because of the collaborative nature of the programmers working on it. At the same time, he said that he was drawn to Bitcoin not because he thought it would take over the world but because it was a "fascinating experiment at several levels."    The last year, he said, was a year of "increasing visibility." The next year, he said "will be the year of action."    \u2014By Nathaniel Popper of The New York Times  ', 'publisher': 'CNBC', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.cnbc.com/2014/02/18/regulators-and-hackers-put-bitcoin-to-the-test.html', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 18, 5, 52, 14, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -18000)), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Regulators and Hackers Put Bitcoin to the Test'}, {'articleText': u'   Major bitcoin exchange Mt Gox announced on Monday that users should soon be able to withdraw funds from their accounts amid growing tensions and a price collapse for the virtual currency.

(Track the price of bitcoin here)    Mt Gox told customers that in a effort to resolve an issue with withdrawals, the system needed to be in a static state.  "In order for our team to resolve the withdrawal issue, it is necessary for a temporary pause on all withdrawal requests, to obtain a clear technical view of the current processes," Mt Gox said on its website on Friday morning.   "We apologize for the sudden short notice. All bitcoin withdrawal requests will be on pause, and the withdrawals in the system will be returned to your Mt Gox wallet, and can be reinitiated once the issue is resolved."

Mt Gox is the third-biggest bitcoin exchange in the world, representing around 14 percent of total bitcoin trade in the last week, according to Bitcoinity.org.     However, it has recently experienced lengthy delays when exchanging bitcoin into U.S. dollars. It has also suffered a series of public relations disasters, including when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security seized its bank account in May 2013, saying it had never property registered as a money services company.

(CNBC explains: What is Bitcoin?)    As with other virtual currencies, concerns linger that the anonymity of bitcoin, which allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services, means it could be used for fraud, money laundering and other criminal activities.    "Today in the global financial system there are common regulations around things like \'knowing your customer\' and anti-money laundering, and I think those are going to get applied in this (bitcoin) as well," said Allaire, the CEO of Circle, which builds products that let businesses and individuals pay and accept bitcoins.     "As the monetary base in digital currency grows, it will create new issues for central banks to think about how this interacts with their existing systems from a financial stability perspective \u2014 but that is going to take a good decade or two," Allaire added.    Circle was launched last October with a $9 million investment from venture capitalist Jim Breyer, Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners.

They are instead generated online, via a process known as mining, and their volume is capped at 21 milion.    Allaire forecast a decline in the very high level of volatility seen in the price of bitcoin of late.     "As you see more institutionally focused exchanges set up in places like London and New York, that provide mechanisms like derivatives, shorting and hedging, and real institutional participation, I think you will see a much more stable price," Allaire said.

Prices fell to below $600, before stabilizing around $800 for most of December and January.    "Today it is clearly highly volatile," said Allaire. "Just to put it in perspective, the total volume of bitcoin that trades on any given day is 30,000 to 50,000 bitcoins \u2014 that is like a small cap stock. So when you have low volume, low liquidity and mostly retail market participants, you end up with a high degree of volatility."    There was some good news for virtual currency users on Friday, as the world\'s longest-standing bitcoin trading platform resumed trading in China.

BTC China is the longest-standing bitcoin trading platform in China and was until recently the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange, according to Bitcoinity.org. In December the company decided to stop accepting trades denominated in the yuan due to pressure on third-third party payment processor from the country\'s central bank.    However, Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China told CNBC via telephone that the decision has now been reversed, just in time for the Chinese New Year holidays.    "Everything is hunky dory," he told CNBC. "Essentially the government never disallowed it."    (Read More: Bitcoin price halves as China clampdown escalates)    In December, China\'s central bank ordered third-party payment agencies - which provide clearing services for bitcoin exchanges - to stop any "custody, trading and other services" related to the virtual currency. The platforms were told to end working relationships with virtual currency exchanges before the end of January.    BTC China operated a voucher system in the interim to allow users to redeem their cash, allowing investors to change their bitcoin back into yuan. However, Lee revisited the ruling by the PBoC and determined that the warning was solely for banks and payment processors.     He told CNBC that the PBoC was actually implying that bitcoin exchanges just needed to register with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), essentially recognizing currency exchanges as a business category and a legitimate business.    (Read more: Bitcoin crashes 20% on China clampdown fears)    BTC China is now accepting yuan deposits via its corporate bank account, but is still not working with the third-party payment processors. Lee said that the deposits meant that trades are a little more "cumbersome" and take a little longer.     When the news of the Chinese clampdown in December broke, the price of a bitcoin fell to below $600 and stabilized near $800 for most of December and January. Despite this week\'s news, the price hasn\'t seen any upside. On Friday the currency was trading at $929 on major exchange Mt Gox and $849 on CoinDesk\'s index, which measures a basket of prices around the world.    This lack of movement, according to Lee, is because of the "chilling effect" that the PBoC had on bitcoin in China. He said that trading volume in China has dropped since December and doesn\'t expect it to suddenly reverse. He believed that these third-party processors had lost a sizeable chunk of their business due to the ruling, but hoped that in the long term a more formal regulatory statement from the PBoC could allow the two sectors to work together once again.

Singer believes that gold will be back in favor soon.    "If the global economy recovers strongly without a significant uptick in inflation, then gold might continue to be a neglected asset class.

"If the choice ultimately is between preventing money laundering on the one hand or permitting innovation on the other, we\'re always going to choose squelching money laundering first," he said.

So how does someone get into the current bitcoin rush?

Here\'s how it\'s done.   How many bitcoins are there?  When the algorithm was created under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto\u2014which in Japanese is as common a name as Steve Smith\u2014the individual(s) set a finite limit on the number of bitcoins that will ever exist: 21 million.

What exactly is mining?There are three primary ways to obtain bitcoins: buying on an exchange, accepting them for goods and services, and mining new ones. "Mining" is lingo for the discovery of new bitcoins\u2014just like finding gold. In reality, it\'s simply the verification of bitcoin transactions.       For example, Eric buys a TV from Nicole with a bitcoin. In order to make sure his bitcoin is a genuine bitcoin, miners begin to verify the transaction.     It\'s not just one transaction individuals are trying to verify; it\'s many. All the transactions are gathered into boxes with a virtual padlock on them\u2014called "block chains."    Miners run software to find the key that will open that padlock.           Once their computer finds it, the box pops open and the transactions are verified. For finding that "needle in a haystack" key, the miner gets a reward of 25 newly generated bitcoins.

The software required to mine is straightforward to use and open source\u2014meaning free to download and run.   A prospective miner needs a bitcoin wallet\u2014an encrypted online bank account\u2014to hold what is earned. The problem is, as in most bitcoin scenarios, wallets are unregulated and prone to attacks. Late last year, hackers staged a bitcoin heist in which they stole some $1.2 million worth of the currency from the site Inputs.io. When bitcoins are lost or stolen they are completely gone, just like cash. With no central bank backing your bitcoins, there is no possible way to recoup your loses.    The second piece of software needed is the mining software itself\u2014the most popular is called GUIMiner. When launched, the program begins to mine on its own\u2014looking for the magic combination that will open that padlock to the block of transactions. The program keeps running and the faster and more powerful a miner\'s PC is, the faster the miner will start generating bitcoins.  Demystifying bitcoin mining Jon Steinberg, president and chief operating officer of BuzzFeed, unveils a bitcoin mining rig he built himself.   When mining began, regular off-the-shelf PCs were fast enough to generate bitcoins. That\'s the way the system was set up\u2014easier to mine in the beginning, harder to mine as more bitcoins are generated. Over the last few years, miners have had to move on to faster hardware in order to keep generating new bitcoins. Today, application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) are being used. Programmer language aside, all this means is that the hardware is designed for one specific task\u2014in this case mining.   New faster hardware is being created by various mining start-ups at a rapid rate and the price tag for a full mining rig\u2014capable of discovering new bitcoins on its own\u2014currently costs in the ballpark of $12,000.     (Read more: How to make your email as stealth as Edward Snowden)    There is a way around such a hefty investment: joining mining pools. Pools are a collective group of bitcoin miners from around the globe who literally pool their computer power together to mine. Popular sites such as Slush\'s Pool allow small-time miners to receive percentages of bitcoins when they add their computer power to the group.     The faster your computer can mine and the more power it is contributing to the pool, the larger percentage of bitcoins received. Bitcoins can be broken down into eight decimal points. Like wallets, pool sites are unregulated and the operator of the pool\u2014who receives all the coins mined\u2014is under no legal obligation to give everyone their cut.    Joining a pool means you can also use cheaper hardware. USB ASIC miners\u2014which plug into any standard USB port\u2014cost as little as $20. "For a few hundred dollars you could make a couple of dollars a day," according to Brice Colbert, a North Carolina-based miner of cryptocurrencies and operator of the site cryptojunky.com. "You\'re not going to make a lot of money off of it and with low-grade ASICs you could lose money depending on the exchange rate."    The other way you could lose money when it comes to mining is power consumption. Currently, profits outweigh money spent on the energy needed to mine. Again, that could quickly change due to the volatile price of bitcoin.     "It\'s time sensitive, like a yo-yo", said Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin developer for the payment processor BitPay. It\'s not mining or investors that are causing the radical highs and lows in the currency\'s value, it\'s the media, he said. "Bitcoin\'s price tends to follow media cycles, not hardware or mining. The difficulty in mining is not the highest correlation in bitcoin value."    \u2014By Anthony Volastro, CNBC Segment Producer ', 'publisher': 'CNBC', 'author': {'twitterurl': u'http://twitter.com/VolastroCNBC', 'name': u'Anthony Volastro', 'twitterhandle': u'VolastroCNBC'}, 'url': 'http://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/23/cnbc-explains-how-to-mine-bitcoins-on-your-own.html', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 23, 13, 48, 46, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -18000)), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'CNBC Explains: How to mine bitcoins on your own'}, {'articleText': u'  Ebay is now considering allowing customers to use bitcoin for payment for both eBay and PayPal, sources inside the company told CNBC.

Marcus isn\'t the only prominent tech executive who has publicly praised the digital currency.    On Tuesday, Andreesen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreesen wrote a piece called "Why Bitcoin Matters" in The New York Times. Andreesen\'s firm has invested over $50 million in bitcoin start-ups.

"We have to make sure it doesn\'t become an avenue to funding illegal activities," Lew says.   Treasury Secretary Jack Lew called bitcoin a "phenomenon," but told CNBC on Thursday that the U.S. government needs to make sure the digital currency doesn\'t become a funding haven for criminals and terrorists.    In an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Lew told "Squawk Box" he has spoken to JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon about bitcoin, and the two share a certain "incredulity" about it.

(Read more: Treasury launches new security\u2014first in 17 years)   In a separate interview, Dimon told CNBC Wednesday that JPMorgan would be unlikely to have much to do with bitcoin.    "The question isn\'t whether we accept it. The question is do we even participate [with] people who facilitate bitcoin?" he said. "The people who are going to eventually really get upset with it will be governments."    Bitcoin will eventually be made to follow the same standards as all other payment systems, Dimon predicted. "That will probably be the end of them."    Lew said the government has made it clear through enforcement actions that it will look at bitcoin and similar transactions and will "enforce all the rules on illegal money activity."  Treasury and Congress at odds on debt limit timetable Congress should act as soon as possible and make sure there are no more self-inflicted wounds, says U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, discussing why lawmakers need to act in a timely manner to increase the nation\'s debt limit so the government can pay its bills.   On the issue of the nation\'s borrowing authority, Lew told CNBC that Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling as soon as possible and not wait until the last minute.    The U.S. economy is doing pretty well, and lawmakers should avoid another self-inflicted wound to growth, he said.    In a letter to congressional leaders, Lew warned the government would likely run out of borrowing authority by late next month, if lawmakers do not act swiftly to raise the federal debt ceiling.    The Treasury can use so-called "extraordinary measures" to forestall default, but those measures do not include delaying refund checks to American taxpayers, he said.    Congress passed a two-year budget deal in December, but did nothing to address the need to increase the debt limit.    Heated debates in Washington over the borrowing ceiling roiled financial markets in 2011, when the risk of default prompted Standard & Poor\'s to downgrade America\'s debt rating.    Political dysfunction rattled Wall Street again during October\'s government shutdown.    On Iran, Lew said sanctions have worked and gotten the country\'s attention concerning its nuclear ambitions.

"They\'ve stuck with the old reliable Visa and MasterCard, but they pay much higher rates to process those credit cards than your average McDonald\'s or Burger King [does]."  But the biggest hurdle is the inability to do recurring billing with bitcoin, which is designed as a one-time transaction service.   Online porn companies (and the online arms of traditional adult studios) make their money on monthly subscriptions. Users sign up once and don\'t have to think about it again (in fact often forgetting they\'re signed up for automatic billing). Businesses are concerned that if customers had to make monthly transactions, they wouldn\'t stick around.

The head of one of the world\'s largest bitcoin exchanges told CNBC that the ban on the virtual currency by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba won\'t affect his business.    Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba said Tuesday it would note accept bitcoins on its online marketplace, Taobao. It also banned the sale of the equipment, merchandise and software used to mine the virtual currency.    "We\'ve found other methods to allow our customers to deposit money into our exchanges to buy and sell bitcoins so our business is unaffected by the recent Taobao decision today," Bobby Lee, chief executive of bitcoin exchange BTC China, told CNBC.    Alibaba\'s actions are seen as a response to the People\'s Bank of China (PBoC) warning against the use of Bitcoin last month as it looks to IPO this year and attempts to rid its marketplace site of fake goods.    In mid-December, the price of bitcoin plummeted by 50 percent since record highs of $1,200 in late November after reports that the PBoC had ordered third-party payment providers -- which provide clearing services for bitcoin exchanges -- to stop any "custody, trading and other services" related to the virtual currency.

(Read more: Bitcoin crashes 20% on China clampdown fears)    "Through our knowledge what the PBoC is worried about is the high volatility of bitcoin prices, indeed, when we were the first bitcoin bitcoin exchange to eliminate trading fees in September we saw volumes spike up and what essentially happens when there is no trading commission is a free-for-all and that causes a lot of volatility in the prices."    "That\'s why we decided to take a more prudent approach to have trading commissions to moderate the market and bring less volatility to bitcoin prices in China and the world."    (Read more: Buyer beware: Bitcoin\'s fate could rest with China)    Lee said he did not think bitcoin was a bubble asset "any more than any other asset class including real estate, stocks, currencies."     "It\'s just another asset class and it\'s been clearly defined in China as a new digital commodity, a digital asset class and people are allowed to buy and sell it however there is a warning," he added.    "Even I would warn people that if you buy and sell bitcoin it is a volatile phenomenon so don\'t put all your eggs in one basket.

Here are 11 myths)    While acceptance for bitcoin continues to grow\u2014gaming website Zynga this week said it would accept bitcoins for payment\u2014Danco said it faces four challenges before gaining Wall Street\'s acceptance:   1. Clear regulation    It seems bitcoin\'s path to legitimacy runs straight through government and regulatory agencies, quite likely the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Says Danco:    Early signs from regulators are more promising than I initially expected, but we still have a long way to go. CFTC: Bitcoin most likely falls in your lap, whether as a commodity, currency, or derivative. Take a stand!   2. A) More adult supervision, and B) Big endorsements.    Bitcoin indeed needs to shed its image as a toy created by hobbyists and nerds. After all the leading bitcoin exchange is Mt.Gox, which is not an abbreviation for "Mount Gox" but rather an acronym for Magic The Game: Online Exchange, where folks used to trade cards for a Dungeons & Dragons-esque game.     I can\'t see Prudential Insurance, Vanguard or the Monetary Authority of Singapore trusting their assets with these kids. Those of you running Bitcoin exchanges, dump the rhetoric, go hire some pros from SWIFT, the major credit card companies, central banks, the FSA, etc.    On 2B, bitcoin already has gotten some pretty weighty endorsements\u2014hedge fund titan Michael Novogratz, for instance\u2014but could use a little more heft, Danco said.    (Read more: Bitcoin endorsed by top hedge fund manager)    To get broad buy-in of its legitimacy, Bitcoin needs some sponsorship by big players. Some well-known VCs have jumped in, but we need one or two mammoth banks like JPMorgan or Deutsche Bank to come onboard; not shady entities based out of the Caymans   3. Establishing two-way transactions and delivery vs. payment (DVP).    DVP is another byway on the way to legitimacy. It ensures that users of bitcoin aren\'t going to get ripped off on the other end as it requires payment at the time of delivery for the goods in question.    When a DVP and security registration can be automated via a decentralized P2P process, Bitcoin takes the banking world by storm.   4. A clearer identity.    Danco explains:    Finally, to become institutional, Bitcoin requires optional and verifiable identity opt-ins. Identity for securities settlement instructions is going to be known in advance before diving into anonymous-looking alphanumeric strings of private and public keys. (An exception may be made for dark pool transactions.) My guess is that institutional "wallets" (read: custody accounts for bitcoin) may have some identifiable and consistent beginning, then unique and cryptographic back ends.    While achieving the four steps will be difficult, it also is very doable, rendering bitcoin skeptics increasingly into the shadows.    It\'s hard to go against 30 years of habit, but this old dog has converted from Krugmanesque bitcoin hating to being optimistic about virtual currencies.

U.S. businesses are helping the controversial cryptocurrency known as bitcoin to make a price comeback.   On Saturday, Zynga, the San Francisco-based social game maker, quietly took to Reddit to announce that it\'s now accepting bitcoins as a form of in-game payment. The pilot program, which Zynga is working on with bitcoin payment processor BitPay, will be offered for seven games including Farmville 2 and Castleville.  "Zynga is always working to improve our customer experience by incorporating player feedback into our games," the company\'s Reddit post said. "We look forward to hearing from our players about the bitcoin test so we can continue in our efforts to provide the best possible gaming experience."   Almost immediately following the news, the digital currency\'s value began to climb. By Monday morning, it had topped $1,000, then fell below that mark a day later on the online Mt.Gox exchange. The recent increase comes on the heels of a dramatic dip, after regulators in China enacted a crackdown on the digital currency in mid-December that caused BTC-China to stop accepting deposits in yuan. That news had sent bitcoin prices tumbling nearly 50 percent from a Dec. 4 record-high of $1,238.     (Read more: Bitcoin breaks $1,000 after Zynga opts in)    But Monday\'s rally also brings into focus a budding trend: U.S. businesses may be beginning to utilize bitcoin to specifically attract a key consumer base.     "One thing that people haven\'t focused on with bitcoin is that its users are a very attractive advertising demographic," said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group.    The typical user has been profiled as a tech-savvy male, age 25 to 40, with above-average income, commonly residing on one of the U.S. coasts, according to Colas. Indeed, several surveys and reports show similar findings, including data released by Quantcast last April.  Zynga testing bitcoin More U.S. businesses are choosing to use bitcoin, reports CNBC\'s Morgan Brennan. Zynga will accept the digital currency for in-game purchases.    Zynga is the latest among a growing number of companies adopting bitcoin. Last month, online retailer Overstock.com announced that it would roll out a bitcoin purchasing option, expected in the second half of the year.     (Read more: Overstock CEO: Why we\'ll take bitcoins)  Other businesses that have taken to the digital currency include dating site OKCupid, blogging platform Wordpress, social news site Reddit, and billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson\'s space travel outlet Virgin Galactic. Even a New York City-based real estate firm, BOND New York, is offering clients the option to pay broker fees in bitcoins.    And analysts are beginning to take a closer look at the companies that could gain from bitcoin adoption. Wedbush analyst Gil Luria recently sent out a note detailing the businesses that stand to gain (or lose) the most from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Among those Luria believes could enjoy a boost  are eBay, IBM and Overstock, which he notes will benefit in part from a "publicity push within the bitcoin community."    "Nerds, techies\u2014whatever you want to call the early bitcoin adopters\u2014it\'s is a very high-level demographic that\'s using this," said CJ MacDonald, co-founder and chief operating officer of Gyft, a mobile gift card app that offers a bitcoin purchasing option. "We have had some high-profile, high-end retailers saying they want to adopt it to go after this very group."    (Read more: Buzzfeed COO: How I mined for bitcoins)    The San Francisco-based company peddles gift card offerings for over 200 vendors, including Victoria\'s Secret, Target and Whole Foods. On the Gyft platform, bitcoins can be used to purchase them all.     MacDonald said that over the last six months, since the site added bitcoins, it has welcomed millions of dollars in sales through the digital currency. Of course, the main purchasers are males fitting that "early bitcoin adopter" profile.      So what are they buying? "We see a lot of electronics\u2014Best Buy  or Amazon or Crestfield gift cards," he said. "We even had one guy use bitcoins to buy Crate and Barrel gift cards to furnish his whole house."   \u2014By CNBC\'s Morgan Brennan.

We are doing this for both business and philosophical reasons.     First, the business reasons: There are large numbers of holders of bitcoin who are eager to patronize firms that will accept this form of payment, but so far, their options have been limited. I believe that by being the first major online retailer to accept bitcoin, we will tap into a significant group of loyal consumers, and as a result our share of the overall market will grow.     In addition, the cost of carrying out credit-card transactions is roughly 2 percent. Given that our net margin is also approaching 2 percent, the avoidance of such fees will make bitcoin sales that much more profitable.     (Read more: Buzzfeed COO: How I mined for bitcoins)    And, while it's true that the value of bitcoin has proven more volatile than that of gold, this will not be a risk to Overstock.com; we will either immediately convert bitcoin to dollars or hedge our bitcoin risk through bitcoin-dollar derivatives (should such a market develop).    Now, the philosophical reasons:  I believe limited government is a better business model for our nation than is unlimited government (and limited government has the additional benefit of being  consistent with our Constitution). Among the many vices of authoritarianism is that it can sustain itself only by offering more things to more people than it can actually deliver, and one way it makes up the difference is by debasing its currency.     (Read more: Bitcoin breaks $1,000 after Zynga opts in)    People who share my belief in limited government often favor gold-back money, because for millennia, mankind's stock of gold has increased at a rate of 2-3 percent per year, and no government mandarin has the power to will additional gold into existence.    As a digital currency, bitcoin is, of course, suited to online transactions. In addition, however, it possesses those key virtues of gold: Bitcoin is mathematically constrained such that there can be no more than 21 million (infinitely divisible) units, and the supply will grow in a predictable manner.    (Read more: Want to snag a rich guy? Accept bitcoins)    I am agnostic regarding the future value of bitcoin.

Over the holidays, I spent many hours reading up on bitcoin, and I was struck by just how large the ecosystem and variety of players was. Putting aside the debate around bitcoin\'s value, I think there is no debate that this is an intriguing and very very interesting space.  As an investor, I\'m bullish but cautious, as a hobbyist I can\'t stop reading about it.  (By way of disclosure, I own a very small number of bitcoins. Also I\'ll tell you about a bunch of services I\'ve played with but I can\'t vouch for them beyond a cursory examination. There are certainly fraud and theft concerns in the bitcoin universe so caveat emptor.)   A few aspects of the ecosystem that I\'m currently studying for the pleasure of it are: hobby mining rigs, mining pools, software, and professional mining hardware and shares.    Hobby rigs  You need tremendous computing power "to mine" bitcoins in an efficient manner. This is because it takes a lot of time and electricity for a computer to perform the calculations to crack the math problems that result in new bitcoins. However as a hobbyist, you can turn just about any computer into a "mining rig." (Read more: Bitcoin breaks $1,000 after Zynga opts in) My friend Kane Hsieh came over this week and built this rig with me. (And my "with me," I mean he was kind enough to install everything while I asked questions.) Here\'s what it looked like:   We used a $25 dollar RaspBerry Pi computer running Linux and those USB keys with the bitcoin logo are Icarus processors. They are specialized processors for mining bitcoins.  Amazon lists a version of these too.  For what it\'s worth, Kane says that setting up a small mining rig is a great way to get some hands-on learning about bitcoin but warns that small rigs are almost never profitable. (Read more: \'Coinye West\': Yep, it\'s a Kanye West bitcoin-like currency) Mining pools   Because we have such a small computer, we joined a "mining consortium."  This allows us to combine our small bits of work mining coins with a network of many others.      Here is our mining rig just starting to work after connecting to the consortium; we chose Eclipse:   Software    There are countless programs that can be used to mine coins. We chose cgminer, which is very popular, but with names like Bitminter, Easyminer, and BTCMiner there are lots of choices.    (Read more: Don\'t rule out a ban on virtual currencies)    There are also plenty of places to buy, sell, trade and hold your bitcoins. Mt.Gox is the one of the largest exchanges and Coinbase is one of the easiest and most mainstream, recently closing financing rounds from Union Square Ventures and Andreesen Horowitz.    Going pro    The professional end of the spectrum includes massive server farms with specialized hardware that are mining to make real money. These tend to be in cold places because the hardware runs so hot. You can actually buy "mining shares" in some of these companies that allow you to access a portion of the coins they mine. I don\'t know the credibility of these operations and have not met anyone who has bought a share.      At the lower end of pro, you can buy hardware from a company like Butterfly Labs, which Kane has used from a learning perspective and says works.    (Read more: Here\'s what should bolster bitcoin in 2014) Again, bitcoins over time get progressively harder to mine and the electricity costs of mining can approach or surpass the coins that you mine. So I\'m uncertain if mining can be profitably done at this point.     Conclusion    You can see there is a lot here. It strikes me that this is an investable market from the hobbyist, education, and entertainment angles, beyond the investment and exchange angles. I\'d be curious to know the number of hobbyist in the space but judging from the volume of message boards it must be significant.     The interest in bitcoin is such that a some innovative hacker even figured out a way to create an app that lets you load the bitcoin price and chart onto your Pebble watch. I couldn\'t resist and loaded it up myself: The risks in the bitcoin market are clear and we see new ones each day, such as the FBI holding $130 million in bitcoin that it could dump. However, on the other side, we see major financial institutions making bets on it as well, such as news that Fortress might be starting a bitcoin fund.  (Read more: Bitcoin endorsed by top hedge-fund manager)   The intellectual excitement and great many bitcoin hobbyists sit outside this two-sided coin.  Now if bitcoin completely fails, the hobbyists will no doubt flee. But I think it\'s worth noting that hobbyists can be an important driver in something new like they were with personal computers, and it feels like bitcoin certainly has that.   \u2014By Jon Steinberg   Jon Steinberg is the president & chief operating officer of BuzzFeed and is responsible for all business management, company operations, finance, and social advertising operations.

Last year was nothing short of exciting for bitcoin and with 2014 set to be another interesting year for digital currencies, the Bitcoin Foundation expects wider adoption and the recognition of its potential to support bitcoin going forward.    Over the course of 2013 the digital currency increased nearly 6,000 percent in value on the Mt. Gox exchange, closing the year out at $806.    In late November, bitcoin peaked at $1,242 before concerns about Chinese regulation and a global speculative bubble led to a rapid depreciation. Bitcoin has since stabilized around current levels. Bitcoin was trading at $816 on the Mt Gox exchange on Tuesday afternoon in Asia.    (Read more: Do you really know bitcoin?

"There\'s certainly a lot of work that needs to happen\u2026 between now and bitcoin being a unit of account unto itself," Patrick Murck, principal and founder of the Bitcoin Foundation, which aims to standardize, protect and promote the use of bitcoin worldwide, told CNBC on Thursday.    (Read more: Big US online retailer to accept Bitcoin)    "But people are working on it and I think that\'s what you\'re going to see happen this year.  Having reliable exchanges\u2026 more merchants coming on board, more consumers using it as a payment platform. All of those things will support bitcoin going forward as a currency," he added.    Among the key events for bitcoin in 2013 were a surprisingly positive U.S. senate hearing on digital currencies in November and regulatory action from Chinese authorities  in December.    Despite the positive developments in the U.S., concerns about greater global regulation continue to linger after the People\'s Bank of China ordered third-party payment providers to stop using bitcoin in December, sparking a sharp fall in the value of bitcoin.    However, Murck expects such concerns to fade.    (Read more: Meet \'Bitcoin Jesus\', a virtual currency millionaire) Is Bitcoin already in a bubble?

So I think you\'ll see the same thing in China," he added.    As for what 2014 holds for the underlying value of bitcoin, Murck said it all comes down how useful bitcoin is.    "I think the underlying value is going to be determined by how useful it is to people in commerce. So the more merchants that adopt it, the more consumers use it, the more businesses use it for supply chain management and for business-to-business transactions and cross-border transactions, the more valuable bitcoin will be to everybody and that will be reflected in the price."   \u2014 By CNBC\'s John Phillips.

Bitcoin was one of the most unpredictable stories of 2013 and likely will continue to grab headlines as investors and consumers learn more. See what CNBC\'s Jeff Cox has to say about it.   While there were plenty of other big surprises in 2013, no business story likely was more unique than bitcoin, the online simulated currency that threatened to shake up the global monetary system.    Debate raged over bitcoin\'s legitimacy: Was it just a playful creation of hobbyists, or a new exchange medium brought about as a logical reaction to profligate currency manipulation from the world\'s central banks?    Nick Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx, was one of the early Wall Street analysts to take a serious look at bitcoin back in February. To wrap up 2013, he examined what he sees as 11 myths surrounding the subject.  1. Bitcoin is huge    For all the talk and hype, bitcoin is tiny with a total value of just $10.8 billion. That compares to the total stock of U.S. dollar at $800 billion, Colas said in a report. There\'s also about $4 trillion in global currency traded every day.    (Read more: What you need to know about digital currencies)   2. Bitcoin enables drugs and terrorism    Colas argues that bitcoin is "way too volatile" for the average drug dealer or terrorist. That\'s not to say that "some enterprising dealers" don\'t use it, but if it was widespread Colas contends its value would be "$10,000 or higher" compared to Friday morning\'s trading value of about $800.   3. Bitcoin is a currency    This is perhaps the most contentious observation, as bitcoin is often referred to as a "cryptocurrency." Colas offers that bitcoin is "a system much more than a \'currency\'" in which holders agree to take part in a transaction of value.    Banking analyst Dick Bove may have been more to the point, where in a recent analysis he called bitcoin a "low-cost replacement for credit cards and other payment mechanisms." There are virtually no costs involved with bitcoin transactions, as opposed to wire transfers, for instance.   4. Bitcoin has never been more volatile than now    Untrue, according to a chart Colas prepared analyzing bitcoin\'s one-month returns and standard deviation. It actually was more volatile in May 2011, before most people even had heard of bitcoin.    (Read more: Behind China\'s love affair with bitcoin)   5. Chinese citizens can\'t buy bitcoins    BTC China has been one of the most dominant exchanges for bitcoin, with nearly 10 million transactions over the past month, according to bitcoincharts. That\'s despite a government ban on financial institutions handling such transactions.   6. Bitcoin is not a store of value    This is an expression often given to gold and silver, and Colas said it does not apply to bitcoin. "Bitcoin may one day prove it deserves to sit alongside those assets," he said. "It isn\'t there yet."   7. Bitcoin is untraceable    Bitcoin transactions happen online. Enough said. (Though Colas does offer: "If you think anything you do online is secret, I can\'t help you.")   8. Losing anonymity will render bitcoin useless    Conversely, traceability doesn\'t dim bitcoin\'s allure, which is really in its low or no-cost transactions.    (Read more: Big US online retailer to accept Bitcoin) Fed has no interest in stopping bitcoin: Lacker Jeffrey Lacker, Richmond Federal Reserve president, shares his thoughts on digital currencies and provides his outlook on economic growth.  9. It\'s a Ponzi scheme    No, it isn\'t. Ponzi schemes have no other intent than to defraud. There\'s no evidence to suggest that bitcoin is in the same boat, despite the strong price volatility and attraction for speculators. The Federal Reserve has noted the "potentially significant positive social value" of bitcoin, Colas noted.   10. Bitcoin is "ready for prime time"    No, it isn\'t. As Bove, Colas and numerous others have pointed out, bitcoin won\'t get legit until price volatility gets tamped down and a truly safe, mainstream storage place emerges. Colas suggests banks, Paypal or Apple come up with a storage device.   11. Something better will kill bitcoin    This one doesn\'t get so much play, but it\'s worth considering. Bove has contended that being first gives bitcoin a tremendous competitive advantage, and Colas echoes that point. "There are other online money transfer products out there, of course, and more to come," he said. "The challenges will be the same for all of them: security, utility and legal compliance."    The quest to meet those challenges likely means bitcoin remains a serious story for 2014.    "I absolutely understand why there are so many bitcoin haters out there. But don\'t hate the player; hate the game," Colas said. "Technology is a tremendously disruptive force in society, and it knows no boundaries. It disturbs every status quo. That\'s what is does. Just don\'t make the mistake of thinking that you can reverse it by calling it a bubble."   \u2014By CNBC\'s Jeff Cox. Follow him on Twitter @JeffCoxCNBCcom.

Confidence in bitcoin? Silicon Valley guru Mark Andreessen\'s firm is investing $25 million in Coinbase, which is reportedly the largest-ever investment in a bitcoin-related company, reports CNBC\'s Mary Thompson.    Bitcoin is a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining. Some 12 million bitcoins are believed to be in circulation, with a cap of 21 million \u2014 meaning no more bitcoins can be created after that point.    The initial fall in price in early December coincided with a statement released on the website of China\'s central bank which warned of the risks that the crypto currency posed. It warned that Chinese financial institutions should not trade the digital currency saying that while it does not yet pose a threat to China\'s financial system, it carries risks.    Its surge to over $1,000 in November was attributed partly to increased interest from Chinese users as well as favorable comments by regulatory officials at a U.S. Senate hearing in November.

This will happen in such a way as to permit governments to exercise incredibly powerful control over all human behavior.  Tune in to CNBC\'s "Closing Bell" Friday at 3pm ET. Signature Bank Chairman Scott Shay will be on, talking about how close we are to becoming a cashless society and the huge threat it is to our freedom. While this may sound like a paranoid doomsday scenario to some, as a real world finance professional, I believe that this scenario is not only eminently possible, but most of the technology is already available \u2014 albeit not yet fully marshaled \u2014 to frighteningly make it reality. Technological advances have led to the creation of algorithms that can instantaneously review financial transactions, determining the nature, location and even the appropriateness of a purchase decision. These have been freely used by credit- and debit-card companies.    Cardholders already encounter this technology when they receive fraud alerts after a transaction that looks out of kilter with the particular consumer\'s normal purchasing patterns. The technologies can thus serve to protect consumers. That said, they have already been used to control consumer behavior. In 2010, Visa and MasterCard, bowed to government pressure \u2014 not even federal or state law \u2014 and banned all online-betting payments from their systems. This made it virtually impossible for these gambling sites to continue operating regardless of their jurisdiction or legality. It is not too far-fetched to wonder if the day might come when the health records of an overweight individual would lead to a situation in which they find that any sugary drink purchase they make through a credit or debit card is declined. Sounds far-fetched but maybe not so.  (Read more: Fraud alert: How to prevent holiday-related identity theft)   You might think then that the person can always pay cash and remain outside the purview of these technologies. This may be the case for the moment, but we are well on the road to becoming a cashless society.  According to a MasterCard study, 80 percent of U.S. consumer transactions are electronic.  In Sweden, one observer estimates that only 3 percent of transactions are made with currency. In fact, the decline in cash use has become so pronounced in Sweden that homeless beggars have been given card readers by Situation Stockholm to sell freely distributed newspapers and to receive alms, since potential donors no longer carry cash.  Governments and central banks are also subtle supporters of a cashless society as there are indeed costs to producing currency and coins. Monetary policy could also be much more efficiently executed without currency circulating, since it would then be easy to implement negative interest-rate policies. But there is also a sinister risk to a cashless society.  Cashless society a threat to freedom? Signature Bank\'s chairman Scott Shay is worried about the potential for a cashless society.   This point comes when a society goes cashless and the potential for econgularity is at its highest. A singularity is defined as the point in which technological advancement will "radically change human civilization and perhaps even human nature itself."  It is impossible to know if this will actually happen, but a cashless society would certainly give governments unprecedented access to information and power over citizens. Currently, we have little evidence to indicate that governments will refrain from using this power. On the contrary, the U.S. government is already using its snooping prowess and big-data manipulation in some frightening ways.     The technological command of the National Security Agency has been widely reported on and does not need repeating here. Suffice it to note, that it would be no challenge for the NSA or certain other government agencies to monitor any company or consumer transaction in real time, if it so desired.    (Read more: CryptoLocker crooks launch \'customer service\' site)    To provide another example, the U.S. government is becoming very fond of seizing money from citizens first and asking questions later via "civil forfeiture." Amazingly, the government is permitted by law to do this even if it is only government staff members who have a suspicion, not proof, of wrongdoing. By seizing a citizen\'s or a firm\'s money, the victim/defendant has almost no choice but to settle.  A case about civil forfeiture was recently argued in front of the Supreme Court in which the government seized all the money of a tiny family-owned grocery store on the suspicion that it was laundering cash because its cash deposits were below the $10,000 level, an occurrence that triggers a report to the government. By depriving companies and individuals of the cash to defend themselves, even innocent firms are under immense pressure to settle or to plead guilty. To make matters worse, the dramatic consolidation of the banking system has made it easier for the government to acquire information as there are fewer access points.  For example, JPMorgan, one of America\'s largest and most powerful banks, is the size of more than 3,000 smaller banks combined, and the top four U.S. banks control about 60 percent of the U.S. banking deposits.    The U.S. government has also been using less dramatic means to limit the freedom of its citizens. In recent years, it made it increasingly difficult for companies to operate or individuals to transact by adding compliance hurdles for banks wishing to deal with certain categories of clients.  By making it too expensive to deal with certain clients or sending the signal that a bank should not deal with a particular client or type of client, the government can almost assuredly keep that company or person out of the banking system.  Banks are so critically dependent on government regulatory approval for their actions that observers like Warren Buffett, among many others, have recognized the government\'s immense power over banks.  Recently, even JPMorgan, announced that it would be ending relationships with whole categories of clients that pose compliance challenges.     If current government trends continue, a cashless economy could thus very well lead to an econgularity. Imagine a future in which soon, a government staff member could suspect an individual of some misconduct, or perhaps deem that person\'s politics or speech unacceptable.  It would take just a few keystrokes to order all financial institutions to decline any withdrawal or payment from that individual and to transfer any deposits or payments of that person to the government, or at least freeze any access to funds.  Perhaps this would need to be reviewed by a secret court that would approve 99.7 percent of all requests, but would provide a veneer of due process. It is fair to think that the targeted individual might starve to death. This could be insured by cutting off access to the payment system of anyone suspected of helping the targeted individual.      (Read more: Get ready: Here comes the REAL economy)    While bitcoin, a private synthetic cyber currency, might seem like an antidote to this scenario, it, too, requires connectivity, which can be subject to monitoring. Further, the exchange of bitcoin to the currency of the country in question can be regulated in ways that could limit or even end its utility. Testimony by regulators to the U.S. Senate on Nov. 18th that the government can deal with bitcoin via the existing currency transaction surveillance laws and surveillance methods in place is a pretty good indication that U.S. agencies could also envelop bitcoin via meta-data and behavioral analysis.    It is by no means certain that such a dystopian outcome will occur in a cashless society. It could be that certain countries such as Sweden can make the leap without any adverse consequences. But my fear is that some governments will find it irresistible to take much greater control of the everyday behaviors of their citizens simply because they can.    Cash should be preserved: Pro Signature Bank\'s chairman Scott Shay says there is a "place for cash and a place for non-cyber means of transfer." He also discusses his view of bitcoin.    There are certainly positive outcomes that can be obtained by going cashless. For example, banning sale transactions of cigarettes or sugary drinks or stopping cardholders from overeating, gambling, or whatever other vice is targeted, could lead to a decrease in these vices and their associated problems. A decrease in those problems could positively impact other areas, like, for example, our nation\'s health-care system. A cashless society would probably also mean less street crime. Yet in return for these benefits, there is an incalculable cost to our humanity. We would lose our freedom to make decisions. It is easy to imagine a totalitarian regime using these tools to great harm. Given current U.S. government policies, it is also very easy to imagine even a liberal government such as our own, being sorely tempted to use the confluence of these technologies. And once used, because they are so very, very powerful, even liberal governments will be enticed into using them until there is pretty complete monitoring and control of every transaction.      So now is the time to urge Congress to repeal civil forfeiture and to forbid government agencies from intruding on the financial payments of U.S. citizens or companies without due process unless it is a matter of national security or imminent harm. We can also hope that the Supreme Court will find civil forfeiture to be unconstitutional as it should be viewed. By putting such strictures in place today we can change the trajectory of our current path. On a day-to- day basis, we should also decrease out debit- or credit-card use to preserve the market share of currency in our economy and stop the demise of cash. There are lots of other benefits to this as spending real cash out of our pockets makes us consider our expenditures more carefully and increases our savings rate.

We joined him on his commute to discuss the bitcoin, or virtual currency fad, that is garnering recognition globally, and other top-of-mind issues. Among them: how big business is worried about New York City's Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, and how millennial darling Miley Cyrus may venture into porn. (Yes, porn.)

Despite optimism over the state of the global economy, chief financial officers from around the globe are becoming increasingly wary of asset valuations -- with some stating that they have held back on deals because of froth in markets.    More than 92 percent of respondents believe that U.S. stock valuations are high, according to a CNBC survey of 26 chief financial officers (CFO) from Europe and Asia who make up the CNBC CFO Council. Half of those CFOs who said their company was looking at acquisitions, admitted that they had completed the deal regardless of these valuations. About a third said valuations had been a deterrent.    The technology sector was a particular area of valuation concern, with more than 83 percent of those surveyed seeing valuations in the technology sector as being high, with over 8 percent believing that they are extremely high. Twitter\'s current price of around $40 since its initial public offering in November is also overvalued, according to 86 percent of respondents. (Read More: Business confidence booms, hiring returns: Global CFO Council survey)   But despite this market froth, the CFOs remain convinced that the Nasdaq Composite is not in a bubble. The index has risen 33 percent so far this year with a current price-to-earnings ratio of 19.87. In late November, big-cap technology stocks helped the Nasdaq to finish above 4,000 points for the first time since the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. Almost two-thirds, 62 percent, of the CFO survey\'s respondents believe the Nasdaq is not in a bubble, compared with 38 percent who believe it is.    CNBC\'s survey showed finance chiefs have similar overvaluation concerns when it comes to virtual currencies. Bitcoin allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. There\'s no central bank that issues them and they can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining. The price of bitcoin has topped $1,000 recently and whilst many advocates tout it as an alternative to fiat currency, our CFOs aren\'t as certain.    Over 85 percent of CFOs that responded see it as a "purely speculative" tool for investors trying to cash in, whereas around 14 percent considered it a "legitimate currency". Nearly 64 percent replied that they thought the digital currency was currently in an economic bubble.   The results reflect the concerns of several high-profile investors that years of central bank stimulus have made the markets too buoyant.    The U.S. Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet soon after the global financial crash of 2008. It has since embarked on two more quantitative easing programs and is currently pumping an open-ended $85 billion-a-month into the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have both followed the Fed with asset purchases and low interest rates have been prevalent across the globe in an effort to combat deflation.

Virtual currency bitcoin lost around $200 in value on Thursday after the People\'s Bank of China outlawed the country\'s banks from using it, leading some to cash in on their investments.    At around 8 a.m. London time, the price of a bitcoin sharply dipped by 20 percent back below the $1,000 level it reached around one week ago. At midday London time, the currency was trading at $980 on major exchange Mt Gox and $932 on CoinDesk\'s index, which measures a basket of prices around the world.    The fall in the price coincided with a statement released on the website of the China\'s central bank which warned of the risks that the cryptocurrency posed. It warned that Chinese financial institutions should not trade the digital currency saying that while it does not yet pose a threat to China\'s financial system, it carries risks.

The statement, in response to questions posed by the media, detailed its volatility and its risks regarding price speculation. It added that it could be exploited by criminals and facilitate money laundering and terrorist financing activities.    With this in mind, the central bank said it was barring financial and payment institutions from using bitcoin, including buying and selling or insuring bitcoin-linked products. It added that ordinary individuals were free to use bitcoin but it had no legal status in the country.     Bitcoin is a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.

This came after predominant Chinese state television company CCTV broadcast a documentary detailing the digital currency in the Summer.

"We anticipated that there might be a significant reaction in China," he told CNBC. "There\'s a lot of risk to the Chinese capital control regime."    What was most interesting for Hileman is that instead of the selling being confined to China, investors around the globe followed suit and the price depreciated because of this.

Cyprus is out of "the danger zone," Finance Minister Harris Georgiades told CNBC ahead of his meeting Tuesday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.     "We have come a long way since the springtime," Georgiades said, while acknowledging challenges remain. It was in March when Cyprus suffered a massive banking crisis that spread fear in financial markets around the world.      The news delivered to Lew is the story of an earlier-than-expected turnaround.    Cyprus was just upgraded by Standard & Poor\'s in November, about a year after its crisis erupted. Compare that to Greece, whose debt was also upgraded in November, but more than four years after its crisis started in 2009. While the so-called Troika (the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) criticized Greece\'s extremely slow response to requests for reforms, Cyprus received glowing assessment reports from the get go.    (Read more: S&P\'s Moritz Kraemer: Europe not out of the woods)    Georgiades suggested the recovery was due to Cyprus\' willingness to commit and enact reforms quickly, including the recapitalization of the banking system and budget cuts. "The problem with Greece, decisions were postponed for a long time," said Georgiades, while commending current Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras for his work on that front.     Ultimately Georgiades credits the Cypriots themselves and the structure of the economy that makes it "a good place for business."    In the interview Monday at the Cypriot Embassy in Washington, Georgiades acknowledged one of the biggest remaining hurdles is the final elimination of capital controls, imposed during the crisis to prevent the flight of euros out of the country.    Georgiades recommitted to the elimination of most of the country\'s capital controls by January\u2014with one key exception: the transfer of money outside of the country. "I\'m not speculating" as to when that will happen said Georgiades. "I will obviously be reviewing the situation, but I think the gradual but steady relaxation is the correct one under the circumstances and we shall continue."    He did explain the framework under which it was likely to happen: when the recapitalization of the banking system is complete. "The stronger the confidence in the system \u2026 the easier and the sooner we shall be able to lift all the restrictions."    If capital controls are lifted before investors believe the bank is strong enough to stand on its own, depositors will flee, and in a worst-case scenario, cause a bank to collapse. That\'s why a complete recapitalization is a key "milestone" before the final restriction on foreign transfers is lifted, Georgiades said.   The \'bail-in\'    Confidence in a bank is a psychological game as old as banking itself.    When the history of the euro zone is written, Cyprus will be remembered for a key legacy from its crisis: the bail-in. In exchange for a 10 billion euro bailout from the EU, the country agreed to "bail ins" of its banks. A bank bail-in imposes losses on a banks\' shareholders, debt holders and even their large depositors before any outside capital is brought in. Shareholders for the most part lose everything. Debt holders and large depositors are given shares in the new, presumably better capitalized, bank after it receives new capital investments.     The bail-in is set to be implemented across the European Union in the event of the next crisis. The goal is to stop the use of taxpayer money for bank bailouts.    The meeting with Lew went as planned Tuesday. "The secretary welcomed progress the Cypriot government has made in implementing its reform program and made clear he looked forward to future progress. He also stressed the importance of the ongoing support from Cyprus\' European partners in ensuring that the country is put on sound financial footing," a Treasury official said.  Cyprus FM: Worst is behind our country Cyprus\' debt has been upgraded just 9 months after a massive banking crisis on the tiny island nation. CNBC\'s Michelle Caruso-Cabrera provides insight on her interview with Cypriot Finance Minister Harrris Georgiades about the country\'s recovery, and bitcoin.  Bitcoin innovation    Cyprus most recently was in the headlines because a private university there is accepting bitcoin for tuition payments and also offering a degree in bitcoin.    "Well, it\'s a very exciting prospect. I have to say that personally I\'m still learning regarding this bitcoin phenomenon because I think it\'s a very interesting phenomenon on a global scale. And it\'s very interesting and encouraging that a private university in Cyprus has been bold enough to take this step," said Georgiades.     Georgiades said he wasn\'t informed about the university\'s decision to accept bitcoin, but rather read it about in the news. He feels the news is emblematic of Cyprus and its economy.    "It was a private initiative and that shows how ahead the private sector, private enterprise and innovation is. And that\'s how it should be," he said. "I am a strong believer in the ... dynamism of the private sector and especially in Cyprus. ... Because of this entrepreneurial spirit which we have in Cyprus ...

Julia Wood takes you through some of the other major players.   He has helped seed about a dozen different businesses involving bitcoin and actively promotes the currency, earning him the nickname "Bitcoin Jesus."   "I believe Peter Vessenes [chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation] gave me the title when we were at a BBQ together.  I was explaining bitcoin to about two dozen high school kids. The kids were all enthralled by bitcoin, and hanging on my every word," he told CNBC.    (Read more: Bitcoin breaks $1,000 barrier for the first time)   "Peter then commented that \'it\'s like you are a Bitcoin Jesus, and you have all your disciples around you\'," he added.    His venture MemoryDealers.com, a website that sells discounted computer parts, became the first mainstream business to accept bitcoins as payment. It\'s also worth noting that it was through this business that he made his first million, in dollar terms, back in 2003.    Ver\'s nickname is as colorful as his past. Born and raised in Silicon Valley, he moved to Tokyo, Japan in 2005 after serving 10 months in federal prison for selling a product called "Pest Control Report 2000"\u2014which he described as a firecracker used by farmers to keep animals away from their cornfields\u2014on eBay. Why the bitcoin economy could go mainstream Patrick Murck, Principal & Founder at the Bitcoin Foundation, thinks innovation in the protocol and infrastructure will help drive the virtual currency into the mainstream.   Before that, in 2000, he tried his hand in politics, running for California State Assembly as a Libertarian, but lost.   Bitcoins are \'incredibly cheap\'   Bitcoin\'s meteoric rise in the recent weeks has led to concerns that it may be a speculative bubble, but Ver doesn\'t believe this is a concern for him.    At $1,000, Ver regards bitcoin as "incredibly cheap," noting that if it gains in popularity as he anticipates, each bitcoin would be worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.    "The rapid price rise is due to people with money starting to realize how important of an invention bitcoin is," he said.    "Bitcoin will experience many bubbles along its way to improving the lives of everyone on the planet.  I\'m not concerned with the short-term price fluctuations," he added.    Ver, who currently uses bitcoins to pay factories in China to produce electronics components for his company, says he plans to use them "to promote the ideas of Voluntaryism and economic freedom" in the future.

The name, in fact, is an acronym that stands for "Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange."

(Read more: Bitcoin\u2014theworld\'s best boost to a brand?)    The aim is to lure many of the people who have been attracted to Bitcoin and other virtual currencies this year, including businesses that are looking for a cheap way to process payments outside the traditional banking system.    Coeptis\'s "global standard currency" would be fully backed by reserves of gold, held in a trust, in effect turning the precious metal into a medium of exchange.    Mr Jackson and two others pleaded guilty in July 2008 to running an illegal money transmitting business and to aiding money laundering, after federal investigators charged that "criminals of every stripe gravitated to e-gold as a place to move their money with impunity".   More from the FT:Bitcoin must learn from past failures The Bitcoin mystery is all about trust China falls in love with Bitcoin    Bill Cunningham, chief executive of CMO, the Florida company behind Coeptis, said the technology behind e-gold has been updated and expanded to ensure it complies with the emerging regulations covering virtual currencies. Unlike e-gold, it would verify members\' identities before allowing them to trade.    "We believe we will have better anti-money laundering procedures than any other virtual currency business and that we will compare well with the banking industry," Mr Cunningham said.

CMO is planning to buy its currency system from Mr Jackson, but because of his conviction, he will not have an operational role in the company.    For several years, Mr Jackson had hoped to resurrect e-gold himself, but it became clear he would not be able to obtain the money transmitter licences required in most US states.    Mr Cunningham said CMO had begun approaching state regulators about obtaining licences itself and hopes to launch before the middle of next year.

Apparently, a lot of traders are buying it for their own portfolios.   Bitcoin continued its stellar rally on Wednesday, breaking above $1,000 for the first time and marking a rise of over 7,600 percent so far this year.    Many analysts and investors have labeled bitcoin\'s unfettered rise a bubble, yet greater awareness of digital currencies and relief following last week\'s U.S. senate hearing have paved the way for fresh gains.     Bitcoin traded as high as $1,030 on the Mt. Gox exchange, up 7,661 percent year-to-date from its December 31 close of $13.27.    Digital currencies cleared a major hurdle when U.S. authorities signaled a willingness to accept them as legitimate payment alternatives at a November 18 U.S. Senate hearing on virtual currencies. The outcome allayed concerns that the government would take steps that could undercut mainstream adoption.

Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke were also seen as supportive. In an open letter to Senators before the Senate hearing Bernanke echoed comments from former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder who spoke about digital currencies at a House of Representatives hearing in 1995.   "Vice Chairman Alan Blinder\'s testimony at that time made the key point that while these types of innovations may pose risks related to law enforcement and supervisory matters, there are also areas in which they may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system," Bernanke wrote. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.

So overly heavy-handed government regulation looks unlikely," Zennon added.

Billionaire entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson announced on CNBC\'s "Squawk Box" Friday that his commercial space flight venture will accept bitcoin as payment. His tweet confirming the move received nearly 500 retweets and the corresponding story on CNBC received over 4,000 Facebook shares and was one of the most read articles on the site that day.      (Read More: Richard Branson: Buy your space flight with bitcoin)    The viral nature of the cryptocurrency is also evident at a much lower level. A university in Cyprus, a sustainable grocer, a travel website, a delicatessen and a guitar repair shop are just some of the businesses that have received attention online with their decisions to accept bitcoins as payment. A simple tweet showing a business in Soho Village, New York was now accepting the currency received nearly 200 retweets.      Bitcoin is a "virtual" currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining.     Stephen Early, the director of a small chain of public houses in the U.K. told CNBC that it was the "best accidental marketing campaign" he had ever done. His five drinking establishments started accepting bitcoin in June and now receive around \xa31,000 ($1,630) of the digital currency each month.    Early said he frequently appeared on U.K. television during the summer and between 30 and 40 journalists had contacted him regarding bitcoin. He also saw an increased amount of punters that came to the pub wanting to use the new technology, he added. "It certainly gives (businesses) a fair bit of coverage," he told CNBC via telephone.    (Read more: Bitcoin accepted by university in Cyprus)    Richard Branson is wise to start accepting the currency too, he said, adding that a rise in the amount of bitcoin millionaires - with the price passing $1,000 per bitcoin on Wednesday - means there might be more potential customers looking to spend their riches. Branson backs bitcoin Virgin Galactic, which will provide space flights to tourists, is now accepting bitcoin. Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Group founder and chairman, discusses the value and risks for his company.    Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics agrees, saying that bitcoin is rapidly minting a new class of affluent consumers around the globe, and businesses are keen to market themselves to this community.    "We\'re already seeing savvy, risk-taking entrepreneurs, like Richard Branson\'s Virgin Galactic, accept Bitcoin," he told CNBC via email.    "I expect more high-technology companies, particularly ones with unique and or expensive products that can be purchased across borders, to adopt bitcoin as a means of payment. For example, given Elon Musk\'s prior history as a payments system entrepreneur I wouldn\'t be surprised if we soon saw Tesla automobiles priced in bitcoin."    (Read More: Baidu division now accepting bitcoins)    Christian Ward, a media and marketing editor at research firm Stylus said that price speculation has meant bitcoin has failed to prove itself as a viable currency as yet.    "On the one hand, it\'s good to see companies accepting bitcoin, because it moves bitcoin out of the realm of investors and speculators," he told CNBC via email.    "On the other hand, until a significant number of consumers start trading, then companies only really have the publicity boost to benefit from."   By CNBC.com\'s Matt Clinch.

Also, this week, cybersecurity experts testify before the House that they have concerns about HealthCare.gov. Hacking America brings you the latest on the largest bank heist, with five new arrests announced this week. CNBC\'s Amanda Drury reports.   A new report from McAfee Labs confirms the cyberthreat is growing and evolving, with spam and malware reaching record levels last quarter. McAfee Labs released its third-quarter 2013 threat report on Wednesday.     "The industry must work harder to ensure the integrity of these [cyber] technologies given they are becoming more pervasive in every aspect of our daily lives," said Vincent Weafer, senior vice president of McAfee Labs, in a press release.    Consumers already get mountains of junk mail arriving at their homes daily and now their digital mailboxes are also getting deluged with spam. The number of spam messages increased 125 percent in the third quarter, according to McAfee. In September, spam levels were the highest they\'ve been since 2010, with 4 trillion spam messages sent.    In the United States, you may receive many types of spam, including emails about bogus news and job openings as well as solicitation for pharmaceutical drugs.   The number of new malicious software, also known as malware, declined slightly in the third quarter, McAfee said. However, that\'s cold comfort given McAfee discovered 20 million new pieces of malware between June and the end of September. In total, McAfee has identified 172 pieces of malware, in what it calls its "zoo," a library of sorts for malware.     (Read more: With new malware, you have to pay to get your files back)    If you use an Android device, be on alert. McAfee said it found 700,000 new pieces of malware designed to attack Android users\u2014up 30 percent from the prior quarter. The new malware includes banking Trojans that go after account information you may enter on your phone.    Threats against other mobile phone systems, including Apple\'s iOS, are insignificant, McAfee said, compared with the threats against Android.       McAfee\'s new threat report also warned about digital currencies, such as bitcoin, encouraging more regulation for the electronic monies.    (Read more: More bitcoins, more problems: How hackers are targeting bitcoins)    "As these currencies become further integrated into our global financial system, their stability and safety will require both financial monetary controls and oversight, and the security measures our industry provides." Weafer said.    Virtual currency grew to a $47.5 billion market in 2012 and is expected to rise 17 percent to $55.4 billion, in 2017, according to the Yankee Group.     While digital currencies are starting to be used by legitimate companies, like some Subway franchises and Virgin Galactic, they still help facilitate cybercrime. Unlike a traditional bank, virtual currencies are unregulated and allow criminals cover their tracks.

Stocks started off the week by hitting milestone levels, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching 16,000 and the S&P 500  hitting 1,800 for the first time ever. Metropolitan Capital\'s Karen Finerman said she\'s a believer in the rally, adding that she\'s "going to stick with the things" that she likes. "I\'m not selling things into the rally\u2026I have no confidence in my ability time the market," she said. Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management agreed that there\'s still room to run for stocks. "I don\'t quite think that we\'re at a euphoric high," he said on Monday\'s show.     Euphoria certainly seemed to be present in the bitcoin market Monday, as the virtual cryptocurrency broke $600 for the first time.  Trademonster\'s Guy Adami took to the streets of Times Square to ask people if they knew anything about the digital tender. "I\'m not really familiar with the terminology," said one pedestrian in front of the NASDAQ Market Site. Others guessed that a chocolate bar was worth more than a bitcoin. Despite the small sampling of those unfamiliar with the currency, bitcoin prices have skyrocketed this year, up more than 4,000 percent in 2013. Can Gogo continue to soar? With Gogo\'s stock up near 120 percent in the last 3 months, Michael Small, President and CEO of Gogo, attributes strong earnings, raised guidance, and innovation to the stock\'s climb.

Gogo, a provider of in-flight wi-fi service for commercial and private aircraft dropped 11 percent in Monday\'s session.

These included "very strong earnings, raising our guidance, as well as a series of innovative product announcements that we\'ve made." Josh Brown wasn\'t concerned about the recent drop in Gogo, saying the company is still "in its early stages\u2026so you can expect a lot of share price volatility."    On Tuesday, news broke that Yahoo plans to increase its share buyback program by $5 billion. Guy Adami said the news was "one more headline to get excited about," adding that "we\'re going to get a $40 print soon on Yahoo." Tim Seymour, who owns Yahoo, said his reason for buying the stock had to do with the anticipated IPO of Alibaba, of which Yahoo is a 24 percent stakeholder. Regarding the buyback, Seymour said that "they\'re doing the right things...I think you can still own it." Yahoo has been on fire this year, up some 82 percent year to date.

"I don\'t think the Fed is going to taper as quickly as people think," he said. Adding some historical context, Scaramucci noted that "Eight out of 10 years the market goes up, so you\'re going to be losing money on the short side eight out of 10 years."    Scaramucci\'s warning seemed particularly timely, as stocks reversed their downtrend Thursday and the Dow Jones closed above the 16,000 mark for the first time.

Rick Pitino, coach of the reigning NCAA champion Louisville Cardinals men\'s basketball team, joined the crew to talk stocks. A self-proclaimed "Fast Money" fan, Pitino said he\'ll rely on the traders\' advice for an upcoming project with his team. "My 13 players are going to give me $300. We opened up accounts.

"Virgin Galactic is a bold entrepreneurial technology. It\'s driving a revolution. And bitcoin is doing just the same when it comes to inventing a new currency."    "I think the fact that there\'s going to be a limited number of bitcoins out there and it will ultimately be capped\u2014unlike normal currencies where governments can print more currencies\u2014gives it a sense of security," he said, but acknowledged the risk.

But he said that type of seating structure\u2014if implemented on Virgin Airlines\u2014would not cost passengers any more money. "On the Virgin, you pay the same good price on every seat."   Branson also sees Virgin Galatic eventually competing against long-haul international airline routes. He said that a flight from New York to Singapore could take an hour "travelling orbitally around the world at 26,000 miles per hour." He hopes to see that in his lifetime, but said it will "definitely happen in my children\'s lifetime."    \u2014By CNBC\'s Matthew J. Belvedere. Follow him on Twitter @Matt_SquawkCNBC.
