data =[{'articleText': u' Starting next September, some logistics companies in Finland, Sweden, Estonia, and Latvia will begin outfitting shipping containers with a soda-can-size device that will beam out the cargo\u2019s location, how much it\u2019s vibrating as it travels, and its ambient temperature. The data will flow into a repository in the cloud so the entire supply chain can be informed if a shipment\u2019s been delayed. That will prevent redundant e-mails and phone calls. \u201cThere are massive problems communicating between companies,\u201d says Mika Lammi, who\u2019s overseeing the project from his perch at Kouvola\xa0Innovation, a business development agency in southern Finland. \u201cInstead of having separate databases, why not have a single blockchain where everyone can pool\xa0information?\u201d Blockchain is the technology created to support bitcoin, but it may soon surpass the crypto-currency in importance. In the first quarter of 2016, venture capital investment in startups commercializing blockchain eclipsed that in pure-play bitcoin companies for the first time, according to industry researcher CoinDesk, which has tallied $1.1\xa0billion in deals to date. The simplest way to understand blockchain is to see\xa0it as the evolution of\xa0the ledger, a record-keeping tool that\u2019s been central to commerce since ancient times. Ledgers track the movement of assets, whether they\u2019re parcels of land or shares in a company, but they have a big limitation: Access to the trove of data is restricted, ostensibly for security reasons, but often because that\u2019s how its custodians make money. In the age of the cloud, it\u2019s possible for a network of banks or companies in a supply chain to maintain what\u2019s called a distributed ledger that all authorized participants can tap into without needing to go through an intermediary. Another benefit of a blockchain-based system is that it\u2019s more secure. Criminals cannot commandeer individual machines to gain access to a network, as they did with recent attacks on Asian banks, by way of fake messages on Swift, a platform banks use to communicate with one another. In February, that method was used to siphon about $80\xa0million out of an account of the central bank of Bangladesh. \u201cHacking a blockchain is generally considered a low risk,\u201d says Richard Johnson, a market structure analyst at Greenwich Associates. \u201cBitcoin has never been hacked.\u201d The technology is drawing interest from finance, shipping, manufacturing, and entertainment. Gilles Gravier, an adviser at Wipro, the Indian outsourcing giant, says blockchain today is where the Internet was in 1995. Companies will need \u201ccourage,\u201d he says, to use the technology to \u201callow them to do what they haven\u2019t done before.\u201d \u201cSuddenly what you enable is a very different customer experience and behavior, and you can increase your revenue.\u201d \u2014Eric Piscini, Deloitte Blockchain\u2019s boosters say it will drive big improvements in efficiency by streamlining logistics and cutting out intermediaries. Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, a Los Angeles-based investment bank, estimates that savings in trading securities and other assets could reach tens of billions a year. R3, a private consortium of more than 45\xa0institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and Wells Fargo, is working to develop and commercialize blockchain applications. In February the New York-based group revealed it had successfully simulated trades of digital assets on a private network spanning four continents. Tim Grant, managing director of R3, says blockchain could speed the often lengthy process of shifting assets from one party to another. That includes overseas wire transfer, which he says can take days to complete because of antiquated systems and procedures. \u201cIt\u2019s manual processes that can be automated in a very secure and transparent way via distributed ledger,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to collapse these inefficiencies.\u201d John Hancock Financial, a Boston company that sells life insurance and mutual funds, is also experimenting with blockchain. Four staffers in its innovation lab have created a virtual currency for the purpose of rewarding employees, who could use it to buy gift cards, for example, says Ace Moghimi, John Hancock\u2019s head of innovation in North America. \u201cThe whole point here is, let\u2019s build the capability and figure out where you can apply it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could potentially have really big implications for the business.\u201d At Deloitte, the technology underpins an experimental airline loyalty program in which terms and discounts can be adjusted at will so that, for example, a customer whose flight was grounded would be able to use airline points to pay for a meal at a restaurant during a layover. \u201cSuddenly what you enable is a very different customer experience and behavior, and you can increase your revenue,\u201d says Eric Piscini, a principal\xa0at Deloitte. If they pan out, these applications may boost the market for cloud services, already a $175\xa0billion-a-year business globally. Microsoft, which last fall began offering tools for developers to build such systems quickly, has 5,000 blockchains on its servers, up from 50 in December, according to Marley Gray, director for business development for blockchain at the company. \u201cIt\u2019s insane. The demand is off the charts,\u201d says Jerry Cuomo, vice president for blockchain technologies at IBM, which has developed open source blockchain code that has about 1,000\xa0active users. Despite the excitement, blockchain faces obstacles. Speed is one\u2014the technology may be too slow to accommodate a large volume of transactions. Integrating new technology into existing systems may also be a challenge. And regulatory hurdles could deter or slow the adoption of blockchain. Deloitte\u2019s Piscini says the hype is causing some confusion about what the technology is good for\u2014and what it isn\u2019t. \u201cEverybody comes to us saying, \u2018We have a problem, and we need the blockchain to fix it,\u2019\u200a\u201d he says. \u201cHalf the time, they need something else to fix\xa0it.\u201d\xa0\u2014With Matthew Leising The bottom line: Investment in startups commercializing blockchain technology has eclipsed that in bitcoin-only companies.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/olgakharif', 'name': u'Olga Kharif', 'twitterhandle': u'olgakharif'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-19/built-for-bitcoin-blockchain-goes-beyond-crypto-currency', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 5, 19, 18, 17, 30, 702000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Blockchain Goes Beyond Crypto-Currency'}, {'articleText': u' The Hyperledger Project, the developer of blockchain software that\u2019s backed by IBM, Wells Fargo & Co. and other titans of technology and finance, has a new leader.

Virtual-currency trading startup\xa0ANX International is opening up its know-how so that people can issue their own digital assets using blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, the digital money that has become a popular method of paying for goods and services and trading over the Internet. Blockchain technology, essentially a verified public ledger of transactions, can be used to buy and sell any asset, from coin and loyalty points to stocks and bonds. Blockchain systems can eliminate the need for\xa0middlemen such as banks and governments, making it an attractive way to transact or create exchanges. ANX says its new service lets anyone make a blockchain account in minutes and choose how many digital assets to create. Ken Lo,\xa0ANX\u2019s chief executive officer, said the technology for issuing blockchain-based\xa0assets has been in development for the past three years. It has been used internally for some of ANX\u2019s biggest clients, he said, including an e-commerce company that wanted to run a loyalty program. By doing so, companies are able to set up reward programs without complicated back-office processes and reduce the risk of fraud. \u201cI can tell you now the demand for people wanting to get blockchain services is very high -- that\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to systematize it,\u201d Lo said. \u201cWe\u2019re helping the general public get access to blockchain by lowering the barriers to using the technology.\u201d Lo started ANX International in 2013 with co-founders Hugh Madden and Dave Chapman, and set up a bitcoin retail store in Hong Kong two years ago. The company of about 100 people hasn\u2019t raised venture funding since its first angel investment, he said. ANX\u2019s main source of revenue comes from helping companies make customized digital assets and blockchains. "Businesses and organizations that want any system of loyalty will want to use blockchain technology to do that over time because it\u2019s interoperable, global and secure, and exchangeable for other types of assets,\u201d said\xa0Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, which lets people send bitcoin to each other. "We\u2019re a ways from that because we\u2019re not even in a world where digital currency is accepted.\u201d\xa0 For example, a cafe owner could sign up for ANX\u2019s blockchain service and issue reward points. Customers can sign up for an account and every time they buy coffee, they can scan a QR code on their phone and receive points that can be exchanged in the future for free coffee. By doing so, the proprietor can track the points and exchange them at any time, knowing that they are legitimate. Blockchain is already being used by the Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. to issue shares and universities to give out academic certificates. Big banks are pouring money into the technology, captivating Wall Street executives because blockchain offers a way to process virtually any kind of trade or money transfer in minutes rather than days. But the technology is still nascent, with most experimentation being done by the world of finance and players with resources. "Once you drive the price down to zero, then you\u2019ll see a lot more uses for it," Lo said.

Maybe some old ones, too. The gold standard is one of the oldest ideas about money, but the hardest of hard-money hawks sense an opening to breathe new life into it. Decades ago, the amount of cash circulating in a country was often limited by the stash of bullion held in its coffers. Especially since 2008, developed-world policy has headed in the exact opposite direction, expanding the powers of central banks to stoke growth. Helicopter drops of money, potentially the next new thing, would be a giant leap further. For those in the U.S. who see much risk and little benefit in the current course, gold is still a rallying point. And their audience may be growing.  \u201cThe fringe has become the mainstream,\u201d said Jesse Hurwitz, a U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York. He sees the gold standard as a bad idea but \u201csomething we\u2019ll increasingly talk about.\u201d  Of course, full restoration of the system that reigned in the U.S. for a century through the 1970s is almost inconceivable. Even many gold bugs say it can\u2019t be done, and there\u2019s near-unanimity among economists that it shouldn\u2019t be attempted: the U.S. would be in much worse shape, they say, with a Federal Reserve stripped of its ability to freely tinker with the money supply. But the backdrop to this well-rehearsed debate is changing. Rumbling discontent with the economy has left the establishment under siege, and you can\u2019t get more establishment than the Fed. So, in a curious twist, it\u2019s becoming easier for supporters of hard money -- historically a policy favored by the rich -- to give the idea a populist slant. The money conjured up by central bankers after the crisis, the argument goes, all went to bankers, leaving most Americans no better off. It\u2019s time to tie the Fed\u2019s hands, if not to gold, then at least to something. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be a slave to history,\u201d said George Selgin, director of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute in Washington. The gold standard is \u201clike Humpty Dumpty,\u201d he said, hard to put back together. But \u201cwe can think about having a monetary system that isn\u2019t completely arbitrary, where it isn\u2019t just a matter of discretion, people sitting in a room 13 times a year doing whatever.\u201d For a while, to the hard-money folks, the U.S. election season must have appeared full of promise. The Fed was getting bashed from all sides. \u201cIt is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating,\u201d Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders said in a New York speech in January. Economists who support Sanders, like Nobel prizewinner Joe Stiglitz, see the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing as a form of trickle-down economics that\u2019s exacerbated inequality. The proponents of gold or some other fixed monetary rule are more likely to be found in the Republican Party, and what they object to is the very idea of money creation by fiat, not just its distributional effect. Still, there\u2019s some overlap. Ted Cruz, in one of the early candidate debates last year, said the Fed \u201cshould get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.\u201d Then there was Donald Trump. \u201cWe used to have a very, very solid country because it was based on a gold standard,\u201d he told WMUR television in New Hampshire in March last year. But he said it would be tough to bring it back because \u201cwe don\u2019t have the gold. Other places have the gold.\u201d In more recent interviews, the presumptive nominee sounds like he\u2019s drifted toward a soft-money worldview. Last week, he drew attention to the U.S. government\u2019s ability to print money. To the gold bugs, that\u2019s a problem -- but Trump painted it as a potential solution. Below the presidential level, though, the gold camp and its allies have gained support. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing constituency within the House Republican membership that a more rules-based approach or a gold standard would be advantageous,\u201d said Hurwitz of Barclays.  Not all Republicans welcome the development. The gold standard \u201cwas awful. It was horrific,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a former Treasury and White House official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cIt led to some of the worst economic downturns and bouts of deflation in history.\u201d Fratto, now a managing partner at Hamilton Place Strategies LLC, a Washington-based consulting firm for financial companies, says monetary policy is \u201cthe least well-understood\u201d of economic disciplines -- and that makes the central bank an easy target.  Those targeting it include the \u201cAudit the Fed\u201d movement led by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, whose father Ron Paul has been a standard-bearer for gold. Trump and Sanders are among those who\u2019ve endorsed the effort to scrutinize the central bank\u2019s books. For other critics, the goal is to impose new rules on the Fed. What would they look like? Cato\u2019s Selgin favors the ideas of a school known as market monetarists, who say the money supply should be adjusted according to a target for overall spending in the economy. Another, better-known option is the Taylor Rule, which dictates interest-rate adjustments based on changes to inflation and output. The formula has fans in Congress. It\u2019s surfaced in some of the multiple bills aimed at overhauling the Fed -- none of which have yet reached the floor of the House. Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services subcommittee on monetary policy, sponsored one of them. He sees talk of a new gold standard as \u201cmore of an academic exercise than a real-world exercise,\u201d but supports rules that would restrain the \u201cgames being played\u201d by central banks worldwide. George Gilder thinks gold-standard ideas are on the way back whatever the politicians do. Founder and chairman of the Gilder Technology Group and a bestselling author who helped popularize supply-side economics in the Reagan era, he says the trillions of dollars that fly around global currency markets every day are a \u201cbizarre abuse of capitalism,\u201d sucking vitality out of the real economy. Gilder sees hope in countries like China that are \u201coriented toward a gold valuation\u201d -- the Chinese are unfairly maligned for manipulating their currency, he says, when what they wanted was to do the opposite and fix its value -- and in the rise of bitcoin, a digital version of gold. Running through a lot of the gold talk is an apocalyptic strain. True believers think a crash is coming that will blow away the current consensus, leaving only their ideas standing. Gilder sees a political backlash when negative interest rates start taking away people\u2019s savings. Jim Rickards, chief global strategist at money manager West Shore Funds and author of \u201cThe New Case for Gold,\u201d says the Fed and its peers have expanded their balance sheets to \u201cthe outer limit of confidence.\u201d Rickards helped negotiate the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management in the late 1990s and says it\u2019s been downhill ever since. \u201cIn 1998, Wall Street bailed out a hedge fund. In 2008 the Fed bailed out Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in 2018? It\u2019s going to be the IMF bailing out the central banks.\u201d  He sees a chance of \u201cclose to 100 percent\u201d that a downturn worse than the Great Recession is on the way in the next few years -- and then, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be hearing a lot more about gold.\u201d ', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mljamrisko', 'name': u'Michelle Jamrisko', 'twitterhandle': u'mljamrisko'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-17/make-america-gold-again-fed-bashing-spurs-calls-for-an-old-fix', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 5, 17, 9, 0, 0, 6000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Make America Gold Again: Calls for Everyone's Favorite Standard Are Back"}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-05-13/swift-needs-to-pick-up-the-pace-to-keep-the-hackers-at-bay', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' New York (AP) -- Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright, the man who came forward this week as bitcoin\'s founder, is backtracking.

Wright provided technical evidence, including the original encryption keys, that have been confirmed by prominent members of the bitcoin community, the BBC reported. Wright was named as the creator of bitcoin by both Wired and Gizmodo in December, which he said caused unwanted attention on his work and family. A white paper on the virtual currency was released under the name of Nakamoto in 2008 detailing the concept of peer-to-peer electronic cash before software was rolled out in early 2009.

I just want to be left alone.\u201d Before Monday, Wright had stayed silent on the December reports, which cited e-mails, deleted blog posts and documents. He also revealed himself as bitcoin\u2019s creator to the Economist and GQ magazines, the BBC said. The evidence Wright provided didn\u2019t completely dispel all doubts about his claim to be Nakamoto, according to the Economist. The magazine said Wright did not definitively show he had control over an original stash of bitcoin suspected to be owned by Nakamoto. He also had a potential personal interest in influencing debate within the bitcoin community, and claiming he is Nakamoto would strengthen his argument, the magazine said. Jonathan Underwood, a technical adviser to bitcoin startup bitbank Inc., said the proof Wright posted on his blog was a signature from an old transaction and not evidence that the Australian actually controls Nakamoto\u2019s private bitcoin keys. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe Craig was Satoshi when it was news last December, and I still don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Underwood. Yuzo Kano, who runs a bitcoin exchange in Tokyo, is also skeptical of Wright\u2019s claims. \u201cThe key he posted on his blog is actually publicly available information,\u201d said Kano, who quit Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to open BitFlyer Inc. in 2014. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t prove at all that he holds the private keys.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s libertarian roots, with no central issuing authority and a public ledger to verify transactions, has become more mainstream with its adoption by merchants around the world. Its underlying technology has also drawn interest from banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. Advocates have promoted bitcoin as a global, decentralized currency for the Internet age, and venture capital investments in companies affiliated with the technology topped $1 billion last year. Yet the instrument has proven volatile, its role in money laundering and other illegal activity is a constant source of questions, and the price fluctuates with each regulatory clampdown or criminal investigation. New bitcoins are generated all the time, when operators of number-crunching computers called miners solve complex equations and record every transaction. The number of bitcoins that can be generated, however, is limited by design in the digital currency\u2019s underlying software, and the built-in scarcity mechanism means ever more powerful computers are needed to mine the currency. When Wright was first identified, he was living in a modest home on a quiet tree-lined street in the suburb of Gordon, about 13\xa0kilometers from Sydney\u2019s central business district. His then social-media profile suggested a man with an enthusiasm for virtual currency and computing. In addition to numerous college degrees and a stint as a chef, his now-deleted LinkedIn profile listed him as the chief executive officer of DeMorgan Ltd. which has researched bitcoin, proposed a bank for the currency, and offers wallet and exchange services. Wired\u2019s evidence for naming Wright as the currency\u2019s creator included 2008 blog posts discussing bitcoin, along with e-mails, transcripts and accounting forms that corroborate the link. The tech magazine also cited a 2014 administrator\u2019s report into Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Pty., which indicated the e-payment software firm was backed by A$30 million ($23 million) of bitcoin owned by its managing director Wright. The New York Times and New Yorker magazine have both tried to find the person behind the pseudonym.

Wright, an Australian entrepreneur, identified himself Monday as the bitcoin inventor almost five months after he was outed in media reports as the man behind the virtual currency. In a blog post and interviews with three media organizations, Wright said that he developed the original bitcoin software under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, a claim that\u2019s been disputed by others. Wright provided technical evidence, including the original encryption keys, that have been confirmed by prominent members of the bitcoin community, the BBC reported. Still, Wright\u2019s claims are technically difficult to verify. The Economist, which, along with the BBC and GQ, interviewed Wright about his assertions, said the businessman \u201ccould well be\u201d who he claims to be, but he didn\u2019t definitively show he had control over an original stash of bitcoin suspected to be owned by Nakamoto. According to some estimates, Nakamoto holds more than 1 million bitcoin, worth about $450 million at current rates, but they have never been touched, the Economist reported. "At this point, it doesn\u2019t matter who created it,\u201d said Barry Silbert, founder and chief executive officer of the Digital Currency Group. \u201cIf it\u2019s Craig, he\u2019s not been contributing to the protocol for a long time. Where it really does matter is how many bitcoins does he own, and whether he plans to sell them. \u201d Wright was named as the creator of bitcoin by both Wired and Gizmodo in December. He said in the media interviews published Monday that he decided to go public to end the press speculation about the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto and stop the unwanted attention on his work and family. More than one other person has previously been identified as the original creator. QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain \u201cSome people will believe, some people won\u2019t and to tell you the truth I don\u2019t really care,\u201d Wright said in a video clip posted to the BBC\u2019s verified Twitter account. \u201cI don\u2019t want money, I don\u2019t want fame, I don\u2019t want adoration. I just want to be left alone.\u201d Wright couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Before Monday, Wright had stayed silent on the December reports, which cited e-mails, deleted blog posts and documents. \u201cI have a shirt that says \u2018I am Satoshi,\u2019 That doesn\u2019t mean I am Satoshi,\u201d said Adam Draper, chief executive officer of venture capital fund Boost VC. \u201cTell him to move a bitcoin from the Genesis Block and I\u2019ll believe him.\u201d Adding to the skepticism over his identity, the bitcoin community has been in turmoil in recent months over its evolution. Some longtime backers are divided over how to expand the network so it could keep up with growth. Wright had a potential personal interest in influencing debate within the bitcoin community, and claiming he is Nakamoto would strengthen his argument, the Economist said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there are significant implications for the ecosystem or underlying technology, at least not today,\u201d said Toby Coppel, a partner at Mosaic Ventures in London, which invests in bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain technology. \u201cWright claims he has a number of novel and innovative solutions to known issues around scaling bitcoin and its use in smart contracts, but those are as yet untested and could take several years to understand and test at scale.\u201d Bitcoin has libertarian roots, with no central issuing authority and a public ledger to verify transactions, and it has become more mainstream with its adoption by merchants around the world.

Software engineers, whole technology departments, and anyone who\u2019s moving numbers from one spreadsheet to another is \u201cgoing to get decimated,\u201d Daniel Nadler, chief executive officer of Kensho Technologies Inc., said Monday on a panel about technology\u2019s impact on Wall Street. Kensho provides data analytics to banks. \u201cYou have probably the most expensive utility infielders in the world here,\u201d earning six figures for work of little real value, Nadler said. \u201cThose people are not going to have jobs. It\u2019s only shocking to the people who hold those jobs right now.\u201d Banks have cut tens of thousands of jobs since the 2008 financial crisis as global regulatory changes have shattered the old banking models. That trend will continue as the complexity and interconnections of financial markets increasingly mean computer algorithms and artificial intelligence take over the roles of human decision-makers. David Siegel, co-chairman of Two Sigma Investments LP, which has $35 billion under management, said the day may come when banks aren\u2019t even needed to hold money if digital currencies like bitcoin flourish. With blockchain, the distributed software protocol that enables bitcoin to work, authorities like central banks and governments may also see their roles vastly diminished, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable power structure shift,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will ultimately be very hard for governments to stop this advancement because this technology will be so widely available,\u201d making it hard to police, Siegel said. \u201cProbably the same thing will happen with virtual currencies. How do you stop it? It\u2019s software.\u201d Banks have moved vast resources and money into their regulatory and compliance departments in the past several years, Adena Friedman, chief operating officer of Nasdaq Inc., said on the panel. Only now can financial firms start concentrating on new business opportunities to increase efficiency. \u201cThat\u2019s been a really big shift,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are about embracing the technology today, whether it\u2019s Kensho or blockchain.\u201d Nadler said the job losses and repositioning of Wall Street ultimately\xa0will help refurbish bankers\u2019 image with young people. He talked about the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders and its resonance with millenials, who are livid over the \u201crent\u201d that finance extracts from the economy without providing corresponding benefits. That rent-taking is done by \u201creally mediocre people feeling entitled\u201d at the world\u2019s largest banks, Nadler said. That assessment received a quick gut check from Siegel. \u201cPeople will love Wall Street because we move our technology to the cloud?\u201d he said, laughing. Yet not all is lost, according to Corrie Elston, Google Inc.\u2019s chief technology officer for Google Cloud Platform. \u201cThe reason everyone in this room should be super happy about machine intelligence is because it\u2019s about data,\u201d he said. The sheer amount and complexity of data related to financial markets has overcome human computational powers, so bringing in machines to process it all is almost the only alternative, and can lead to new opportunities, he said. \u201cBoom! There\u2019s a different way to do business,\u201d he said. He was less sanguine on recent blockchain developments. The blockchain that supports bitcoin is open to the public because it employs powerful encryption methods. Yet financial firms haven\u2019t wanted to create blockchains where they don\u2019t know all the participants, so they\u2019ve opted to explore so-called private blockchains. \u201cPrivate blockchains will disappear over time\u201d because they amount to nothing more than a database, Elston said. A situation like Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\u2019s 2008 bankruptcy wouldn\u2019t have been avoided if it had been on a private blockchain, and in fact it would have made things worse, he said. Nasdaq\u2019s Friedman disagreed. Banks want to know who is in a blockchain network because of regulatory mandates. And Lehman\u2019s trading partners would have had a clear record of all deals done with the bank prior to its failure, she said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mattleising', 'name': u'Matthew Leising', 'twitterhandle': u'mattleising'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-02/wall-street-told-to-fear-the-machine-as-emerging-tech-takes-jobs', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 5, 2, 19, 52, 17, 522000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Wall Street Told to Fear the Machine as Emerging Tech Takes Jobs'}, {'articleText': u' Blackstone chief Steve Schwarzman, thumb wrestler; Bravo\u2019s Andy Cohen, roller of joints; \u201cVinyl\u201d actress Juno Temple, sewer of her own lingerie. Guests at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Benefit shared things they do well with their hands -- a nod to the new exhibition Manus x Machina, which looks at how some of the most beautiful dresses in the world are made. The event raised about $13.5 million, a record, according to Nancy Chilton, a museum spokeswoman.  A few examples, straight from the exhibition captions: 1,300 hand-pieced pink silk satin flowers; nude cotton lace, hand-woven with laser-cut nude leather applique; aluminum plaques with hand-glued Swarovski crystals. With that kind of attention to fashion detail, no wonder Patrick Bateman got invited to the ball -- er, I mean Benjamin Walker, who plays Bateman in "American Psycho The Musical," and got to show off both his wife and his bow-tie tying skills. (Little did he know Jared Leto and Chloe Sevigny, who played his nemesis and his secretary, respectively, in "American Psycho" the film, would show up later.) The Gemini bitcoin exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss said he plays electric guitar (mostly Van Halen), but wouldn\u2019t be entertaining at the party (that job fell to The Weeknd). Glenn Fuhrman of MSD Capital raved about the banana chocolate cookies his wife Amanda bakes. Paul Rudd, sporting a full beard, joked that he shaves. Yup, just about everybody could think of some secret crafting power -- except for Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor and Conde Nast executive mastermind of the party. "Me?" she said, wearing Chanel. "I can\u2019t cook. I can\u2019t do anything with my hands." Eventually, though, she shook hands on the receiving line for some 600 guests (including Alex Rodriguez, Beyonce, Dominic West and Aby Rosen), joined by co-chairs Taylor Swift, Idris Elba and Jony Ive. The show\u2019s thesis, according to Costume Institute curator-in-chief Andrew Bolton, is that the machine-made is just as artful and valuable as the handmade -- a point of view any machine-maker, like the show\u2019s sponsor, Apple, can fall in love with. Ive, speaking at a press preview earlier in the day, said his team at Apple and the fashion designers featured in the show approach their work similarly: "It\u2019s only when you hold a material in your hands that you come to understand its potential," he said. Still, new technologies take time to catch on: "Once, even the simple needle challenged conventions of the past." In the end, "technology and craft, much like beauty and utility, go hand in hand," he said. Over the past few years, guests from the tech world have become more visible alongside the party\u2019s usual politicians and business and finance moguls. This year\u2019s techies included Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Laurene Powell Jobs, Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, Yahoo\u2019s Marissa Mayer and Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel. "The evening is celebrating technology, and to some degree everything Silicon Valley has taught us," said Wintour. And is the museum developing the tech community as a base of financial support? "Yes," said Daniel Weiss, the museum\u2019s president. "The future for the museum and the rest of the world is engaging with technology in exciting new ways." The veterans of the party didn\u2019t seem to mind the infusion of new blood. "It\u2019s hot, hot, hot," Leonard Lauder said of the Bay Area contingent, before receiving a big smile, hug and kiss from model Kendall Jenner. While Lauder knows his way around, some of the techies have some acclimatizing to do.

They'll also get tax write-offs to buy equipment such as computers, coffee machines or even cars up to the value of A$20,000. The company tax rate will drop to 25 percent for all businesses over the next 10 years. A personal income tax rate of 37 percent will kick in at A$87,000 from July 1, instead of the current A$80,000 \u2014 benefiting about 17 percent of income earners. Those earning over A$180,000 \u2014 the top 3 percent \u2014 will get a further 2 percent cut as a levy intended to repair the deficit expires.

The government will offer 120,000 internship places over four years for out-of-work youngsters. Firms that take on such interns will get a A$1,000 payment. The budget's focus on jobs and growth may give the government a boost in opinion polls two months before the election. Turnbull's predecessor, Tony Abbott, never recovered from a public backlash against education and health cuts in the 2014 budget. \xa0 The government is going after multinational companies that seek to avoid tax in Australia. Income that big corporations shift offshore will be taxed at 40 percent instead of the usual 30 percent. A 1,000-strong taskforce will be set up to prosecute multinationals and the ultra-wealthy not paying the tax they should. The government is cutting several tax concessions for the wealthiest Australians saving for their retirement. From July 1, 2017, anyone earning over A$250,000 will pay 30 percent tax on their so-called superannuation contributions instead of 15 percent \u2014 a regime that currently kicks in at A$300,000. \xa0The amount people can contribute into their superannuation funds each year at a concessional tax rate is now capped at A$25,000, down from as much as A$35,000.

They weren\u2019t there to just talk about blockchain, the new technology some predict will transform finance, but to build and experiment with the software. By the end of the day, they had seen something revolutionary: U.S. dollars transformed into pure digital assets, able to be used to execute and settle a trade instantly. That\u2019s the promise of a blockchain, where the cumbersome and error-prone system that takes days to move money across town or around the world is replaced with almost instant certainty. The event was created by Chain, one of many startups trying to rewire the financial industry, with representatives from\xa0Nasdaq, Citigroup Inc.,\xa0Visa Inc., Fidelity, Fiserv Inc., Pfizer Inc. and others in the room. The event -- announced in a statement this Monday -- marked a key moment in the evolution of blockchain, notable both for what was achieved, as well as how many firms were involved. The technology\u2019s potential has captivated Wall Street executives because it offers a way to free up billions of dollars by speeding transactions that currently can take days, tying up capital. But a huge piece of that puzzle is transforming cash into a digital form. And while some firms have conducted experiments, the Chain event showed a large number of them are now looking jointly at a potential solution. \u201cWe created a digital dollar\u201d to show the group at Nasdaq an instant debit and credit on a blockchain, said Marc West, chief technology officer at Fiserv, a transaction and payments company with more than 13,000 clients across the financial industry. \u201cThis is the first time the money has moved.\u201d Chain is already known in some Wall Street circles for its project to help Nasdaq shift trading of non-public company shares onto a blockchain. But for the most part, it has kept relatively quiet compared with other fintech ventures. The San Francisco-based company also used the April 11 meeting to introduce its customers and investors to Chain Open Standard, an open-source blockchain platform that the venture has been designing for more than a year, said Adam Ludwin, the company\u2019s chief executive officer. What Chain has done is engineer the complicated elements needed for a blockchain to work, so that its customers can build custom solutions on top of that to solve business problems, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been quietly building with a whole bunch of folks for a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cBlockchains are networks, so we think collaboration is important, but what\u2019s even more important than collaboration at the beginning is getting the model right.\u201d The event was kept secret so executives could freely share nascent ideas and take risks. \u201cThe more press, the less quality of the dialogue and problem-solving,\u201d he said. The most common blockchain is the one supporting the digital currency bitcoin, which has been active since 2009. Financial firms have been reluctant to embrace bitcoin, however, as its anonymous users could entangle banks in violations of anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer regulations. Digital U.S. dollars, or any other fiat currency, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t pose those risks. Nasdaq and Citigroup partnered to explore how they can work together, said Brad Peterson, the exchange-owner\u2019s chief information officer. He said blockchain also could be used for reference data -- how specific stocks or bonds are identified across all markets, for example. Wall Street was one of the earliest beneficiaries of computers replacing office systems. Now 30 years later, those legacy systems can be a hindrance to further technological evolution, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the great opportunity -- how to unlock that ability to work your way out from under the mainframe era,\u201d he said. While cash in a bank account moves electronically all the time today, there\u2019s a distinction between that system and what it means to say money is digital. Electronic payments are really just messages that cash needs to move from one account to another, and this reconciliation is what adds time to the payments process. For customers, moving money between accounts can take days as banks wait for confirmations. Digital dollars, however, are pre-loaded into a system like a blockchain. From there, they can be swapped immediately for an asset. \u201cInstead of a record or message being moved, it\u2019s the actual asset,\u201d Ludwin said. \u201cThe payment and the settlement become the same thing.\u201d Ian Lee, head of Citigroup\u2019s global lab network and acceleration fund,\xa0said one of the first areas of research Citigroup undertook when it began studying blockchain was how digital cash could be used. He was impressed with the variety of clients Chain brought together, as collaboration on Wall Street is rare. A lot of companies are facing the same problems with how to make blockchain a reality for their business, he said. \u201cWhile blockchain technology has a lot of potential, it will need to integrate with and co-exist with the financial system that exists today,\u201d he said. Ludwin said blockchain has been validated on Wall Street, and now it\u2019s time to focus on creating solutions. \u201cPutting it all together is no small amount of work, nor is re-engineering business processes within large organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018financial engineering.\u2019 This is software engineering that is going to reshape financial services.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mattleising', 'name': u'Matthew Leising', 'twitterhandle': u'mattleising'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-02/inside-the-secret-meeting-where-wall-street-tested-digital-cash', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 5, 2, 13, 0, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Inside the Secret Meeting Where Wall Street Tested Digital Cash'}, {'articleText': u' Russia is planning to punish users of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying anonymous, difficult to trace transactions help kidnappers and money launderers. QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain The Finance Ministry in Moscow plans\xa0to submit legislation next month that would punish those who use digital currencies with\xa0fines as high as 2.5 million rubles ($38,000) and jail sentences of up to seven years. As opponents criticize such regulations as futile in the face of the growing popularity of bitcoin, Russia joins countries including Bolivia, Iceland and Vietnam in taking steps to criminalize it. \u201cBitcoin can be used to finance the shadow economy and crimes, and this risk we cannot allow in the Russia\u2019s financial system, which we are striving to make transparent and healthy,\u201d the press service of the central bank said in an e-mail. Russia has struggled since the fall of the Soviet Union to build confidence in the ruble and curb the once-common practice of Russians demanding payment in U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies. A decade ago, the government dropped capital controls limiting cash outflows, and in 2014, the Bank of Russia began to allow the ruble\u2019s value to be set almost entirely by the market. Last year, the central bank revoked the licenses of 34 lenders for reasons such as allegedly violating the laws prohibiting money laundering or financing terrorism.\xa0 The Finance Ministry\u2019s proposal would\xa0prohibit the issuance of all cryptocurrencies or their use in exchange for goods and services in Russia.

In Russia, the ruble has fallen about 44 percent against the U.S. dollar since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine two years ago. While cryptocurrencies are stoking a multi-billion dollar underworld economy because they\u2019re easy to transmit and largely untraceable, the technology underlying them is also being embraced by Wall Street and even the Bank of England as a potential game changer in securities trading and settlement, making cross-border payments, and regulating financial transactions with more transparency. Russia also has a favorable view of blockchain, Moiseev said, calling the technology \u201cpromising,\u201d with \u201ca great future.\u201d Hackers are increasingly demanding ransom payments in bitcoin, according to Internet security firm Kaspersky Lab, which also has found that the three top origins of attacks by hackers are China, Russia and the U.S. \u201cThere is a wave going of so-called ransomware when a virus enters a person\u2019s computer and encrypts all files and there is no way to decrypt,\u201d\xa0said Sergey Lozhkin, a senior researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \u201cCybercriminals at that moment start extorting money to decrypt files on the computer and they ask for ransom in bitcoins.\u201d Bitcoin accounts for more than 40 percent of criminal-to-criminal payments in the European Union,\xa0Jan Op Gen Oorth, a spokesman for EU law-enforcement agency Europol said in an e-mail. According to Lozhkin and other experts, however, efforts to ban bitcoin by Russian or any other country won\u2019t work. \u201cA ban would be impossible to enforce because it is a peer-to-peer technology, it is a file sharing technology, and all people need to do to get around the ban is to have computers with an Internet connection,\u201dsaid Jon Matonis, a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a Washington group that promotes the cryptocurrency. \u201cThis perspective is out of step with the rest of the world.

Their 5.6 percent rally this year, while not the biggest in absolute terms, eclipses more than 130 assets from U.S. Treasuries to gold and even bitcoin when volatility is factored in, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 19 percent jump in Colombian stocks might sound like a better deal, but price swings in Bogota exposed investors to six times more risk. When both factors are considered, the gains in emerging-market corporate dollar bonds come out twice as good, the data show. That marks a turnaround for the securities after last year\u2019s selloff fueled by concern higher U.S. interest rates, currency swings and a slowdown in China\u2019s economy would spur corporate defaults in emerging markets. Now investors are returning, buying the bonds of borrowers such as oil-company Petroleos Mexicanos and Brazilian iron-ore exporter Vale SA in a low-volatility sector yielding an average 2 percentage points more than Treasuries. \u201cThere was too much fear earlier and the selloff went to ridiculous levels,\u201d said Luc D\u2019Hooge, who oversees $700 million as head of emerging-market bonds at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich and bought Latin American investment-grade notes including Pemex and high-yield credit in Africa this year. \u201cThe bottom line is that the default risk in emerging markets is not massive. The spreads we saw last year were unjustified and that\u2019s what has led to this performance.\u201d The travails of 2015 prompted economists from the International Monetary Fund to the Bank for International Settlements to warn investors that weakening currencies would raise the cost of repayment in emerging markets and lead to increased defaults. The threat failed to materialize this year as state support, hedging strategies and a recovery in exchange rates helped companies not only to pay off their debts, but also refinance at lower costs. That boosted investor appetite for developing countries, helping sovereign and corporate bonds in both investment and high-yield grades to post the best four performances in a broad swathe of global assets. An analysis of 65 stock markets from Canada to New Zealand, currencies from the U.S. dollar to Danish krone, commodities including oil and orange juice, treasuries, corporate bonds and the biggest exchange-traded funds failed to show a better score on risk-adjusted returns. The bounce-back in oil and commodity prices played a key role in the performance. Companies from these two industries dominate the sweepstakes in emerging-market bond gains. The 2042 notes of Brazil\u2019s Vale and\xa02022 notes of Mexico\u2019s Industrias Penoles SAB de CV have returned more than 17 percent this year. Investment flows into emerging markets have revived both in hard currency and local currency, according a Societe General SA report this week. Optimism about growth has returned, too. Signs of stability in China, an acceleration in India\u2019s economy and brighter prospects for energy-exporting countries such as Russia present a contrast to last year when the air was thick with the talk of slowdowns and recessions. The growth differential between emerging markets and developed markets is set to widen this year and the next, HSBC Holdings Plc predicted this month. The rally has been marked by continued pessimism among some money managers and could fizzle out with a change in any of the factors including the Federal Reserve\u2019s dovish stance, China\u2019s stimulus plans or the stability in crude prices, some analysts say. \u201cIt\u2019s a reluctant type of rally,\u201d said Larry Hatheway, the chief economist at GAM Holding AG in London. \u201cWhat certainly propels it is the absence of alternatives.\u201d Hatheway, who still sees value in the Mexican peso and to a lesser extent the South African rand, said it\u2019s "tough" to find many favorites after gains in the past two months. Others see a need for continued caution against gains overshooting fundamentals. \u201cWe were coming off extreme pessimism last year,\u201d said Alberto Gallo, the head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments Ltd. in London, who sees value in European financial debt and U.S. high-yield corporate bonds. \u201cIt is too early to call it an extraordinary whole year. Investors still need to be very selective about what they buy.\u201d In the developing world, Gallo sees promise in Argentina, as well as countries with less exposure to commodities like India and Mexico. For now, investors are seeking to escape almost $8 trillion of global sovereign notes that offer nothing more than negative interest rates. Emerging markets help them in three ways: their bonds typically have higher rates, with those issued by investment-grade borrowers being relatively safe, and the dollar securities among them strip out the currency risk. \u201cNow people are asking why invest in bonds with negative yields because you\u2019re sure to lose money,\u201d Vontobel\u2019s D\u2019Hooge said. \u201cIf you are ready to accept a little bit of risk and volatility, you can make much more returns.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/SriniSivabalan', 'name': u'Maria Levitov', 'twitterhandle': u'SriniSivabalan'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-26/world-s-safest-returns-signal-emerging-market-pessimism-is-dying', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 4, 26, 23, 0, 1, 3000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"World's Safest Returns Show Emerging-Market Pessimism Dying"}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-04-22/bitcoin-s-big-boom-when-will-blockchain-go-mainstream', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' The U.S. government is looking to create a secure messaging service that it may one day commercialize to rival the likes of Facebook Inc.\u2019s WhatsApp and the Durov brothers\u2019 Telegram.

U.K. consumers will be able to use Circle\u2019s \u201csocial payment app\u201d to transfer sterling for free, the Boston-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Barclays, Britain\u2019s No. 2 bank with 1.5 trillion pounds ($2.1 trillion) in assets, is providing the company with commercial banking services. The FCA, which has set up an \u201cinnovation hub\u201d to stoke the development of fintech companies, granted Circle an e-money license to conduct business in the U.K. The agency has approved more than 80 money-transfer companies for such licenses since 2011, though a spokeswoman couldn\u2019t confirm whether Circle is the first to use bitcoin. \u201cIt\u2019s very telling to see Barclays banking a company engaged in bitcoin-related activities,\u201d said Eric Van der Kleij, the former head of Level39, a London-based firm that helps nurture fintech startups. \u201cThe announcement has the industry wondering if this is one of the turning points for the Internet of money.\u201d Circle, which received an investment from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in a $50 million funding round last April, works by converting dollars and pounds into bitcoins.

But if banks want blockchain to deliver on its promise -- the biggest overhaul of their critical back-office operations in decades -- fierce rivals will need to learn to work together. Several blockchain startups and consortiums are trying to strike a balance between the open nature of blockchain,\xa0a ledger technology that could dramatically speed up transaction times and reduce regulatory costs, and banks\u2019 desire to shield confidential details from competitors. \u201cThe banks touch everything,\u201d said Charley Cooper, a managing director at R3, a blockchain startup backed by more than 40 financial firms. The vast majority of all financial deals have a bank on one side of the trade, said Cooper, who previously worked for State Street Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG. \u201cBecause of that, the privacy piece becomes much more important.\u201d With that in mind, R3 hired Richard Gendal Brown, the former executive architect for industry innovation and business development for IBM, in September. Since then, Brown has been building a blockchain platform for the company called Corda. From day one, the aim has been for the banks to only share what\u2019s needed for the rest of the firms in the group to confirm that assets and cash have changed hands and nothing more, he said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t send it to other people encrypted, we simply don\u2019t send it at all,\u201d said Brown, head of technology for R3. \u201cIt seems obvious but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a universally shared view.\u201d Digital-ledger technologies have captivated Wall Street executives because they offer a way to process virtually any kind of trade or money transfer in minutes rather than days. That vastly reduces the amount of capital that must be set aside until transactions are settled. Targets include trade finance and syndicated loans, areas where it can take days or weeks for transactions to be completed. The feature of distributed ledgers now being built and tested by companies like R3 is known as consensus. In the bitcoin blockchain, for example, anonymous users must verify, or consent to, a transaction before it\u2019s added to the history of all bitcoin deals. With bitcoin, however, all details of every transaction are shared with every computer on the network. That would never fly on Wall Street, so banks and their customers are now working out how to create a consensus model that shields confidential information. The way in which Wall Street moves ahead here could have a profound influence of whether the technology takes hold in finance. The question for banks and other financial firms is whether they should work together on a standardized consensus model that everyone agrees on or work independently on different versions and let the market decide, said Mark Smith, chief executive officer of Symbiont, a blockchain startup focused on building so-called smart contracts. Picking the right consensus model \u201cis important because if there\u2019s a desire for standardization\u201d the industry \u201cneeds to be focused on that immediately,\u201d he said in an interview. On the other hand, he said, maybe the competitive process will deliver the right model. \u201cAll the different ideas should be allowed to blossom and the market will decide,\u201d Smith said. Another group working on consensus models is the\xa0Hyperledger Project, which is made up of a wide range of companies including IBM, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Cisco Systems Inc., Digital Asset Holdings and others. It\u2019s pursuing a variety of open-source software approaches including one where all details of a trade are cryptographically secured and shared with all members of the network, said Jerry Cuomo, vice-president of blockchain for IBM. \u201cI hope as we go we\u2019ll have a library of consensus plug-ins,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHaving different styles of consensus is just going to make this more attractive.\u201d In the end, he said, that flexibility will allow the Hyperledger Project to appeal to other industries beyond finance for blockchain adoption, like land registry, medical record-keeping or sourcing the provenance of diamonds. R3\u2019s approach to consensus can be seen in the name of its platform, Corda. It\u2019s derived from two sources, Brown said. The first, it sounds like \u201caccord,\u201d he said. The second is from the definition of a chord, which is the shortest straight line between two points on a circle. The circle, in this case, being the banks that make up the R3 network, Brown said. \u201cWe talk about connecting peers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have direct point-to-point connections\u201d that will severely limit the amount of information shared between banks and asset managers, he said. Those banks will begin testing blockchain applications on Corda within the next few weeks, Cooper said. When Brown joined R3 last year, the goal was to both build a blockchain system while at the same time determine if there was one that already existed that the firm could adopt, he said. He quickly decided that \u201cthere really is not one size fits all\u201d model and he vowed to avoid \u201chaving a solution in search of a problem.\u201d Corda, which he described as a \u201chedge\u201d eventually \u201cbecame extremely important\u201d to R3, he said. The banks have driven much of the decision making in the area of how to keep confidential information safe, he said. Only \u201cthe absolute minimum amount of information that needs to be shared with the collective to ensure I haven\u2019t done the same transaction before\u201d will be sent, he said. \u201cThe work has begun.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mattleising', 'name': u'Matthew Leising', 'twitterhandle': u'mattleising'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-05/protecting-trade-secrets-challenges-wall-street-blockchain-play', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 4, 5, 13, 50, 22, 925000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Protecting Trade Secrets Challenges Wall Street Blockchain Play'}, {'articleText': u' Microsoft Inc. has pulled ahead of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google,\xa0International Business Machines Corp., and Amazon.com Inc. in the race for supremacy in operating other companies\u2019 blockchains.

And as R3 member companies -- which include Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Wells Fargo Securities LLC and UBS Group AG -- begin their blockchain deployments, Microsoft hopes to win their business, too.\xa0 \u201cThe R3 partnership will help us to see what technology actually works, what combination actually works,\u201d Marley Gray, director of technology strategy at Microsoft, said in an interview. \u201cIt actually increases our focus here at our highest levels. We see it as a tremendous investment for Microsoft.\u201d Microsoft is dedicating a team of five people to the project, but \u201cit could scale up to 50,\u201d Gray said. R3 will \u201chave half our staff touch this project at one point or another,\u201d Rutter said. R3 has 52 employees and continues hiring lab and research staff.

Executives from several technology companies are traveling with the U.S. president on his goodwill tour or\xa0introducing\xa0new business initiatives\xa0focused on the island\u2014or both. Among the companies joining the Cuba parade this week are Google parent Alphabet Inc., Airbnb Inc., PayPal\xa0Holdings\xa0Inc., Priceline Group Inc., Stripe Inc., and Xerox Corp. QuickTake The U.S. and Cuba: Context for a Thaw One main area of focus is\xa0money\xa0transfers. Lifting restrictions on moving money between the two\xa0countries was\xa0one\xa0of the first things\xa0the Obama\xa0administration sought to relax since relations began to warm. Dan Schulman, the chief executive officer of PayPal who\'s\xa0traveling with Obama, said on Monday that his company would\xa0begin offering payments to and from Cubans this year\xa0through Xoom, an international money transfer company it acquired last year. Americans send about $2 billion to Cubans each year, accounting for about 3\xa0percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic\xa0product, according to the U.S. State Department. That\u2019s about a 10th of what\xa0Americans transfer\xa0to Mexicans, the\xa0largest recipients of remittances from the U.S. Fees from payments to Cubans could total as much as\xa0$147 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\xa0works out to about 1.5 percent of PayPal\u2019s annual revenue. Don\u2019t expect PayPal to\xa0get all of that money. The company sees Xoom as a way to compete with Western\xa0Union Co., which also plans to\xa0begin operations in Cuba this year. Bitcoin entrepreneurs, who have long seen remittances as an area ripe for\xa0disruption, recently\xa0celebrated the first transactions between the U.S. and Cuba. Schulman positioned his company\u2019s move in humanitarian terms. "With Xoom and the power of the Internet, Cuban Americans save on high fees\u2014which means more money going back to their families," he said in a statement. Stripe, a San Francisco payments startup, is also offering money transfers to Cubans but focusing on those looking to start businesses. Last week, the company\xa0said it\xa0would start offering Cuban entrepreneurs the ability to incorporate companies in the U.S., set up American bank accounts, and use Stripe to accept payments in Cuba. Cuba isn\'t likely to\xa0be a big revenue driver for any industry\xa0immediately, aside for travel catering to tourists. The Cuban economy is the world\'s 67th largest, slightly smaller than Sri Lanka\'s but still bigger than Belarus\'s.\xa0The American contingent seems to be\xa0planting the seeds of a capitalist culture that has been absent throughout Cuba\'s\xa0revolutionary period. In 2016, that means tech startups. Sheel\xa0Tyle, a\xa0principal\xa0investor at venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates who focuses on consumer technology in\xa0emerging markets, is also traveling\xa0with the Obama\xa0administration.\xa0The Treasury Department also recently lifted its ban on imports of software from Cuba, adding to an exemption\xa0that allowed Cuban apps into the U.S.\xa0 There are still major barriers to the emergence of a Cuban tech startup industry. Broadband penetration on the island is lower than most places on the planet, leaving\xa0locals\xa0to rely mostly on\xa0accessing the Internet in public places. Try coding the next Facebook from the sidewalk outside of a hotel. Obama said Google will try to help offset that by setting up more Wi-Fi and broadband in Cuba. "We\u2019re also exploring additional possibilities around increasing and improving Internet access, but they\u2019re at early stages," Brett Perlmutter, the Cuba lead for Google\u2019s Access project, wrote in a blog post. Even setting the technical task aside, companies like Google will likely have to decide how to navigate the differing approaches that Cuba and the U.S. have to issues like dissent and freedom of expression.\xa0 Obama\'s trip isn\u2019t the first sign of the tech\xa0industry\'s enthusiasm for Cuba. Netflix said just over a year ago that it would offer service on the island, raising eyebrows from those who didn\u2019t think the\xa0infrastructure was in place to do so in any meaningful way. Airbnb has also been operating in the country for\xa0almost a year, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the home-rental site from using Obama\u2019s trip as an opportunity to call attention to its business there. The company\u2019s founders are traveling with the White House, and it said in a statement\xa0that\xa013,000 guests from the U.S.\xa0have booked a Cuban Airbnb, spending an average of $250 per booking.

QuickTake Cyber Currencies That initial foray by the governor into re-imagining the U.K.\u2019s currency will take shape later this year with the introduction of its first polymer banknotes. But his institution is also at the vanguard of a more radical thought exercise on cash itself. With the enthusiastic support of the British government, a key research focus of the central bank is now on digital money and the blockchain technology underpinning it. Britain\u2019s willingness to question such a visible economic manifestation of the state contrasts with a slower approach to other innovations: the country is adopting plastic banknotes long after nations such as Australia, for example. The speed with which the digital-currency agenda has captured the imagination of U.K. officials hints at its potential strategic value for both central banking and the economy. \u201cThe U.K. has the most to gain by embracing the technology and the most to lose by not doing so,\u201d said Robert Sams, chief executive officer of London-based Clearmatics Technologies Ltd., a company working with UBS AG on digital-coin technology. \u201cIf you want to maintain the vision of being one of the premium financial centers of the world, then you have to stay on top of this.\u201d A year ago, the Treasury released a paper noting the \u201cconsiderable promise\u201d of digital-currency technology, and increased research funding. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Mark Walport, weighed in earlier this year, saying it might \u201credefine the relationship between government and the citizen in terms of data sharing, transparency and trust.\u201d While the 2015 Treasury report already mentioned BOE research efforts, bank Chief Economist Andy Haldane and Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent both declared growing interest in the past month, delivering speeches on the potential benefits to society from the lower settlement costs offered by \u201cdistributed-ledger technology,\u201d the blockchain software behind digital currencies like Bitcoin. Broadbent even wondered whether one day, all citizens might have an account with the central bank. Other countries such as China are also studying digital currencies, and the Bank for International Settlements has a working group looking at the issue. Jens Weidmann, president of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, speculated in a speech last month that digital currencies could soon be used to trade financial products. Yet the U.K.\u2019s zeal on the matter stands out -- and while lower settlement costs might interest the Treasury, there is a simpler motivation too. With Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne likely to\xa0reveal lower economic forecasts on Wednesday, when he presents his budget to Parliament, he has a clear incentive to nurture an area with growth potential and\xa0stake London\u2019s claim in financial technology, or fintech, against rivals such as\xa0San Francisco and New York. Osborne went so far as to meet Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook in November, discussing payment technologies and saying afterward that U.K. policy makers \u201cwill go out of our way\u201d to make Britain a global center for fintech. Officials attribute almost a 10th of the country\u2019s economy to financial services, and say 135,000 people work in financial-services technology. \u201cA lot is at stake here,\u201d said Mike Halsall, a technology entrepreneur who helps advise the U.K. government\u2019s Office for Science on fintech and blockchain issues. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position where we could either lose a lot of jobs or gain a lot of jobs depending on how we manage fintech. It feels a bit to me like a knife-edge situation.\u201d U.K. companies are also looking to get in on the act. Market operator ICAP plc said on Tuesday it has completed a proof of technology test case for a distributed ledger using blockchain. Distributed-ledger technology may also pique the interest of authorities for reasons more associated with privacy concerns, such as clamping down on tax evasion, and offering the central bank greater control and insight on the economy. \u201cEvery unit of digital currency is recorded from the moment it\u2019s issued to the very last transaction,\u201d said Professor Andrei Kirilenko, Director of the Centre for Global Finance and Technology at Imperial College Business School in London. Authorities could see \u201cwhere the money is in close to real time. Knowing this, central banks can be much more surgical in policies. Instead of moving the interest rate for everyone, the central banks can move rates for some participants.\u201d The result for now is that Britain\u2019s officials are pursuing their own research and giving private-sector pioneers room to experiment. While the Treasury\u2019s 2015 paper expressed concern over how private digital currencies such as Bitcoin might help criminals, authorities are keen to harness the underlying technologies. \u201cThe regulatory environment in the U.K. is far easier to deal with than in the U.S.,\u201d said Sams of Clearmatics. \u201cThe message from the government has been very pro-fintech,\u201d and \u201cthe regulators have been very engaged from the very early days, particularly the Bank of England.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/UKeconews', 'name': u'Scott Hamilton', 'twitterhandle': u'UKeconews'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-16/britain-rethinks-cash-in-race-osborne-can-t-afford-to-lose', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 16, 0, 1, 1, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Britain Rethinks Cash in Race Osborne Can't Afford to Lose"}, {'articleText': u' It could have taken months for the systems administrators at a large bank in Rome to figure out that one of their servers was talking to Facebook, a red flag given that networks in banks don\u2019t need to know how many \u201clikes\u201d they\u2019ve received. And they might not have noticed the streams of data the server then sent to an array of unknown computers. This kind of threat\u2014coming from inside the network, not from outside its firewall\u2014is difficult to detect. According to IT researcher Gartner, it can take an average 229 days for a business to figure out it\u2019s been compromised this way. What tipped off the bank\u2019s IT department was a little black box containing software from Darktrace, a U.K. startup founded in 2013 by a group of former British spooks and Cambridge University Ph.D.s. After two minutes, the software issued a preliminary alert, color-coded amber. After three minutes, as it became more confident something was seriously amiss, it switched to red. Guarding a network\u2019s perimeter or scanning for known varieties of malware\u2014the two buckets into which almost all cybersecurity programs can be lumped\u2014doesn\u2019t cut it anymore, says Nicole Eagan, Darktrace\u2019s chief executive officer. Hackers have become increasingly sophisticated, changing just enough of an attack\u2019s code to elude established defenses. Cybercriminals are also increasingly using \u201cspear phishing\u201d\u2014e-mails that seem to come from trusted sources but contain malicious links\u2014to worm into networks. Says Eagan, \u201cNo matter how good you think your firewall is, attackers are still getting in.\u201d Dave Palmer, Darktrace\u2019s director of technology, says his company\u2019s approach to cybersecurity was inspired by the way spies conduct surveillance. He should know: Palmer once guarded the networks of MI5, the U.K.\u2019s domestic spying agency, and General Communications Headquarters, the equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency. Darktrace\u2019s software employs more than a dozen machine-learning techniques to study a network\u2019s so-called pattern of life\u2014everything from the devices that usually talk to one another to what sort of data they normally transmit to whom and when. Once a baseline has been established, the program alerts systems administrators to irregularities, color-coding each alert depending on how serious a threat it might pose. Amber means the company\u2019s IT chief should probably be informed, Palmer says. Red means it\u2019s time to wake up the CEO. Martin Whitworth, a security analyst at Forrester Research, says the behavioral analytics honed by Darktrace and rivals such as Anomali and Deep Instinct are necessary because IT executives are drowning in data, with lots of potential for false alarms. That was the case at Drax Power, a U.K. utility that installed Darktrace\u2019s software in 2013. \u201cIt very quickly got rid of that noise and helped us understand what exactly was happening\u2014what was getting through our firewall, how it was getting through, how it was defeating our antivirus,\u201d says Martin Sloan, Drax\u2019s security chief. Darktrace has more than 200 customers, about a quarter of them in financial services and the rest in sectors including energy, retail, and travel. The monthly subscription starts at $10,000. The startup is backed by more than $50\xa0million in venture capital. Among its biggest supporters is Invoke Capital, a $1\xa0billion venture fund headed by Mike Lynch, the onetime CEO of Autonomy, a U.K. software firm bought in 2011 by HP for $11\xa0billion. Lynch and HP are embroiled in a legal battle over allegations that Autonomy\u2019s management inflated the company\u2019s revenue, which Lynch has denied. Installing Darktrace takes about an hour, Palmer says. The self-learning system reaches 80\xa0percent of its capabilities within one month and continues to improve gradually. In early March, Darktrace released an add-on called Antigena that automates many of the responses to a breach that once required humans, such as isolating a server from the Internet. That\u2019s in part to address a manpower shortage. In the U.S. alone, there are 260,000 openings for cyberthreat analysts. Says Eagan, \u201cThere are not enough people trained to deal with all the major breaches.\u201d As an investigation found out, the attack on the Italian bank wasn\u2019t particularly sophisticated. A systems administrator had accidentally downloaded the malware that enslaved the bank\u2019s server in a botnet\u2014an army of infected machines controlled by hackers\u2014used to mine bitcoin. The Facebook page was where the botnet\u2019s zombie machines went to get their instructions. In the past year, Darktrace has encountered far more ominous threats\u2014hackers using machine learning to penetrate networks.

Dropping valuations often kick-start a fresh round of dealmaking, but anemic initial public offerings and billion-dollar markdowns for the likes of Snapchat and Dropbox are causing venture capitalists to sit on their hands -- leaving some startups to starve. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t really know what things are worth,\u201d says Mike Volpi, a partner at Index Ventures, a firm that\u2019s holding on to $1.3 billion tagged for startups. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t know what something\u2019s worth, you don\u2019t know whether you are getting a good deal or a bad deal, so the obvious thing to do is, not much.\u201d The pullback in startup investing began late last year. Venture firms invested 30 percent less money in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2015 than in the previous quarter, and there were 15 percent fewer deals, estimates researcher CB Insights. The company says its preliminary data from the first quarter of this year show investors remain reluctant to pursue deals. For most of the venture capitalists, this is a pause, a reset\u2014not a meltdown, says Dan Townsend, managing director of Top Tier Capital Partners, a fund of funds that seeds thousands of startups through its investments in more than two dozen venture firms. \u201cThere are some very high private valuations that may come off and some business models that will be questioned,\u201d he says. "We\'re very cautious." Venture firms typically invest on a timetable of 7 to 10 years, so taking a quarter or two off isn\'t a big deal. But startups are often trying to launch products or reach growth goals every few weeks and rely heavily on momentum. For them, waiting an extra three to six months for money can mean death. Bitcoin company Bonafide and news site Pixable are among the startups that have shut down due to lack of funds in the last few months. A few years ago, investors might have put in more money so they\xa0could pivot into another market or try a new business model. Instead, the companies were left to founder. "Firms are having conversations now about which companies to support," said Greg Becker, the chief executive officer of Silicon Valley Bank. SVB counts among its customers 65 percent of U.S. VC firms and half of all VC-backed companies. Companies such as Foursquare and Jawbone have been able to woo new investors-- but \xa0only by accepting harsh terms. Both raised down rounds, meaning they took fresh money at lower terms than in the past. Among other things, this diminished the value of shares owned by employees and earlier investors. Foursquare and Jawbone declined to comment.\xa0 Even growing startups are scaling back their ambitions. In September jobs-listings site Thumbtack settled for a $125 million round of financing, valuing it at $1.3 billion, a roughly 40 percent discount off the original asking price. In November online retailer Jet.com closed new funding at a valuation of $1.4 billion, down from a $3 billion summer sales pitch. Ale Resnick, the CEO of the used car marketplace Beepi, claimed nine months ago that he was in the final stages of raising a "monster round\' of $300 million at a valuation of at least $2 billion. The startup enables people to buy pre-vetted cars with just a few taps on their smartphone. His audacious growth plan at the time: To increase his team from 150 to 500 employees and establish a presence in every major U.S. city by the end of December. By fall, though, Beepi was struggling. In January, it raised a $70 million round, valuing the company\xa0at about $500 million. "What happened to us, happened to a lot of companies as they were trying to raise in the latter part of 2015," Resnik told Bloomberg TV in February. Of course, there are always exceptions. Last month, Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Kuaidi closed on an oversubscribed round of at least $1 billion, raising its valuation above $20 billion. Messaging startup Slack is expected to close a significant funding round at much better terms than the $2.8 billion valuation it commanded last year. And Uber continues to raise funding at better and better terms. \u201cWhen you have a fund, there\u2019s a real pressure to put the money to work,\u201d says Steve Kaplan, a professor at the Chicago Booth School of Business who specializes in VC and entrepreneurship. For smaller companies, though, VCs are preaching caution and to tack toward building revenue models sooner rather than later. \u201cThere is no making up on volume when you lose money on every transaction,\u201d says Ben Narasin, a partner at Canvas Ventures. \u201cGrowth at any cost is not a valid model.

An estimated 6,500 Macs were infected with malicious software designed to make files inaccessible to owners of desktops and laptops, according to the Transmission Project, a file-sharing software provider. The decision to target Apple\u2019s OS X software, which is both harder to hack and less widespread than Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Windows, underscores how attractive the practice has become, according to Clifford Neuman, who teaches cybersecurity at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a larger incidence of this ransomware, which is the new way that hackers are monetizing their attacks,\u201d Neuman said. \u201cMost of it has targeted Windows machines in the past because it is the dominant architecture out there.\u201d Researchers at Palo Alto Networks Inc. discovered the ransomware, which they dubbed KeRanger, on March 4. Once downloaded and installed, the bug demanded that users pay one bitcoin to decrypt the data, or about $411 at Friday\u2019s prices. The researchers informed Apple, which revoked a certificate that allowed Macs to download the software, and Transmission updated its program to eliminate the infection, according to Ryan Olson, intelligence director at Palo Alto Networks. The number of known ransomware attacks doubled to more than 5 million by the third quarter of 2015 from a year earlier, according to Intel Corp.\u2019s McAfee security unit. One bug alone caused more than $325 million in damages last year, according to the Cyber Threat Alliance, a group of Web-security companies. The use of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin also makes it easier for attackers to conceal their identities, as opposed to asking victims to transfer funds to a traceable account. \u201cThe business model is working so well on Windows that, when they had an opportunity to do so on Mac, they did it,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt\u2019s been effective to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\u201d The new attack targeting Macs follows Apple\u2019s recent tussle with the U.S. government, which is seeking help from the company to decrypt information on a terrorist\u2019s iPhone.

As the BOE intensifies its research into digital money, officials have \u201ca lot more thinking to do\u201d on the topic, he said. The comments, part of a speech at the London School of Economics on Wednesday, echo those of Chief Economist Andy Haldane, who said in a Bloomberg interview on Monday that the future of cash raises \u201cexistential\u201d questions for central bankers. \u201cSome suggest that central banks will have to issue their own digital currency -- i.e. to supply central bank money more widely, via some generalized distributed ledger -- to meet a \u2018competitive threat\u2019 from private-sector rivals,\u201d Broadbent said. \u201cI suspect a more important issue for central banks considering such a move will be what it might mean for the funding of banks and the supply of credit.\u201d The topic has grown in importance as the rise of peer-to-peer lending and digital money threatens to overhaul finance. That\u2019s left central bankers -- usually tasked with steering the economy and regulating the financial system -- facing some difficult questions. BOE Deputy Governor for Financial Stability Jon Cunliffe said that one issue is the transmission of finance and how people\u2019s savings could be used to fund investment and growth. While clearing payments using a distributed ledger rather than a central bank probably won\u2019t have significant macroeconomic effects, how the technology is used to widen access to the central bank\u2019s balance sheet will be key, Broadbent said.\xa0A distributive ledger that replaced the current system of clearing and settling securities could save some of the $54 billion currently spent a year on those services, he said. Still, digital units like Bitcoin won\u2019t replace more established currencies like the pound, dollar or euro, he said. \u201cAlmost always, these currency substitutions occur only once the existing currency has become deeply compromised,\u201d he said. \u201cEven then, the thing people naturally reach for is an existing, trusted currency -- often the US dollar -- rather than some entirely new unit of account.\u201d The effect of central bank digital currencies would depend on their design and the degree to which they competed with the main form of money in the economy: commercial bank deposits, Broadbent said. The closer that central bank currency resembled a commercial bank account, the greater the drain on lenders would probably be, he said. A central bank digital currency \u201cmight threaten\u201d commercial banks lending activity, according to Broadbent. \u201cIf bank lending became scarcer, or more expensive, it\u2019s likely that investment and economic activity would suffer.\u201d \u201cTaking deposits away from banks could impair their ability to make the loans in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cBanks would be more reliant on wholesale markets, a source of funding that didn\u2019t prove particularly stable during the crisis, and could reduce their lending.\u201d However, if it just reduced demand for physical cash, the retail payments system might become more efficient. \u201cIt\u2019s also true that, were a CBDC fully to displace paper currency, that would open the door to the possibility of materially negative interest rates,\u201d Broadbent said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/CharltonEmma', 'name': u'Emma Charlton', 'twitterhandle': u'CharltonEmma'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-02/boe-s-broadbent-says-digital-currency-shift-comes-with-bank-risk', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 2, 10, 0, 0, 869000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"BOE's Broadbent Says Digital-Currency Shift Comes With Bank Risk"}, {'articleText': u' Former Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. executive Sallie Krawcheck has joined the board of Digital Asset Holdings Inc., the startup run by Blythe Masters that hopes to revolutionize how financial transactions are processed. The development brings together two of Wall Street\u2019s highest-profile women.\xa0Krawcheck, who was previously head of wealth management and chief financial officer at Citigroup and later ran wealth management for Bank of America, currently serves as chief executive officer of Ellevest, a yet-to-open service aimed at helping women invest.

Digital Asset just raised more than $60 million from banks and other investors including JPMorgan, CME Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. The company\u2019s mission is to use blockchain, the software ledger that underpins bitcoin, to dramatically speed up and simplify the process of recording trades. While securities trading today relies on a central authority to oversee the transfer of cash for shares, Digital Asset aims to link all the participants in the process on the same database to allow real-time movement of assets -- seconds rather than current settlement times measured in days. \u201cWe are honored to have Sallie join our Board,\u201d Masters said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cShe has achieved extraordinary success in her career as both an industry executive and entrepreneur, and her unique mix of experience will be a tremendous asset as we build and expand our business.\u201d Distributed ledgers face obstacles to success. Fierce competitors will need to collaborate. Regulatory hurdles could kill or significantly slow progress. And although cross-border payment networks based on distributed ledgers could save banks money, it would also drain revenue away from other parts of their business. Another challenge is integrating new technology into existing systems. Digital Asset is among about a dozen startups that are racing to prove that blockchain can be applied to financial markets. R3, a blockchain startup backed by more than 40 banks, in January successfully simulated trades of digital assets on a private network made up of 11 of its members. Overstock.com Inc. is close to unveiling the first securities-trading system using blockchain, while Nasdaq Inc. recently said it used the technology to complete and record a private securities transaction for the first time.

QuickTake Negative Interest Rates This isn\u2019t of course the long-dead leader of al-Qaeda, but rather the 500-euro ($551) note -- as known by its Spanish nickname. Rarely seen by ordinary citizens, and suspected by officialdom of aiding criminality and terrorism, the single currency\u2019s largest physical unit is slated for a potential phase-out by the European Central Bank. Such an event isn\u2019t momentous, but it coincides with efforts by European governments to curb cash in general, striking a nerve and stoking fears among the public that bureaucrats are conspiring to eradicate real money altogether. While the ECB and other central banks may be tempted as they drive interest rates lower, pushing too far risks backfiring if it drives the privacy-conscious\xa0away from policy makers\u2019 control toward unregulated electronic currencies like Bitcoin. \u201cWe sure need a medium of exchange and we sure need a store of value,\u201d\xa0said William White, an adviser to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,\xa0noting that it\u2019s \u201cnot impossible\u201d decentralized currencies will eclipse official money. \u201cIf it turns out that the system we\u2019ve got doesn\u2019t provide that, then something else will.\u201d Given that cash in circulation in the euro area has risen steadily since its introduction in 2002 to reach 1.06 trillion euros as of last month, any suggestion that all that could someday be removed seems fanciful. The 500-euro note represents 29 percent of the value of all banknotes -- or 306 billion euros -- so a change would be a major intervention in money supply. It\u2019s unclear how the value would be replaced. That\u2019s enough for Jens Weidmann, president of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank and a member of the ECB\u2019s Governing Council, to warn against damaging trust in the currency itself. Lingering unease blew up into a national issue after the German finance ministry this month proposed a 5,000-euro ceiling on cash payments to fight terrorism financing and tax evasion. Bild, a German tabloid newspaper, ran a front-page petition decrying all curbs on the freedom that cash provides. \u201cIt would be fatal if the current discussion about the abolition of the 500-euro note or a limit on cash payments were to give rise to the impression with the public that cash is being taken away, step by step,\u201d Weidmann said on Feb. 24. Austrian\xa0Deputy Economy Minister Harald Mahrer even called this month for citizens to have a constitutional right to cash. Switzerland, with its own currency and an even-higher denomination 1,000-franc ($1,010) note,\xa0also has a proclivity for paper money: a 100,000-franc limit on anonymous cash transactions adopted in January was opposed by members of the fiscally-conservative Swiss People\u2019s Party on the grounds that it enabled state snooping and infringed liberties. Elsewhere in Europe, the public is less bothered. After all, what passed for fintech in the 13th century, when paper currency became known in Europe from China, might have a sell-by date. In Sweden, it may be near. The value of bank notes in circulation there has dropped by a quarter in just five years. It\u2019s not a trend everyone in the country welcomes. Jan Bertoft, secretary-general of the Swedish Consumer Association, says banks are reducing cash-handling too quickly, restricting access to people who need it. That includes older and younger people, those without access to smartphones or the Internet, newly arrived migrants and non-governmental organizations. \u201cCash is a legal mode of payment and this is taking away the right to use this payment method,\u201d he said. It\u2019s \u201cdeeply unfortunate. Everyone should be given time to adjust.\u201d There are more than 100,000 people in Sweden today who need to travel more than 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) to the closest ATM, and among them 36,000 are over 65 years old, Haakan Svenneling, a lawmaker for the Left Party, said in Swedish parliament on Friday.  If Sweden is the future though, it also provides a clue as to what central bankers can do in that environment. At\xa0minus 0.5 percent, the Riksbank\u2019s benchmark interest rate is lower than either the ECB\u2019s deposit rate or the Bank of Japan\u2019s new penalty for parked bank funds. The Riksbank opined in September that negative rates do indeed work better in a cashless environment, as did Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane the same month. That gives fuel to skeptics in countries such as Germany who make the slippery-slope argument, suspecting that authorities are eroding freedoms for their own ends. It\u2019s not a huge leap to imagine how citizens weary of years of ultra-low interest rates and suspicious of surveillance by governments and companies might seek to circumvent the established monetary system. All it would take is enough innovation and the right combination of computing power and software to make something resembling Bitcoin a mass-market form of money -- and central banks \u201ctotally redundant,\u201d says Thomas Mayer, a former chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG and founder of the Flossbach von Storch research institute in Cologne. Some economists \u201csee the abolition of cash as an exit out of their textbook problems,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my suspicion that they haven\u2019t thought through the institutional implications of that. It opens the door to private-sector money, and that\u2019s a completely new world.\u201d Faced with such a challenge, it\u2019s little surprise that central banks are responding. The People\u2019s Bank of China said in January that it\u2019s studying how to issue its own digital currency. In Europe, BOE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe hinted this week at his own institution\u2019s research. \u201cDigital money has the possibility of everybody having an account at the Bank of England, and we\u2019ll do all the money creation,\u201d Cunliffe said. \u201cIf we go there, then we\u2019re going to have to find another way to get people\u2019s savings to go into the economy to finance the investment that creates growth.

The technology underpinning bitcoin could be used to move money, trade stocks, or sell houses more efficiently. One problem is that few programmers have\xa0the expertise\xa0to work on blockchain projects. Jeff Garzik, one of about two dozen\xa0core bitcoin developers, is capitalizing on the hype by creating\xa0a coder-for-hire\xa0service specializing in the blockchain. His startup Bloq Inc. charges customers $3,000 to $5,000 a month to develop new features for\xa0blockchain software and have access to 24/7 customer support. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has agreed to sell Bloq\'s services to its clients, Garzik said.\xa0"That opens up a lot of doors for us early in the company\'s lifetime," he said. "Companies know who to call at 3 a.m. if the blockchain is melting down." Garzik modeled his startup\xa0on Red\xa0Hat Inc., which built an $11 billion company\xa0out of helping businesses\xa0develop and implement Linux and other\xa0open-source software. He used to work at Red Hat, and he said his code can be found in every Android phone and in most data centers around the world.\xa0Since then, Garzik has been an important\xa0contributor to\xa0the technical and promotional benefit of bitcoin. He serves on the board of bitcoin advocacy group Coin Center and on the advisory boards of startups that include BitFury Group Ltd and Netki Inc. He has also tried to launch satellites\xa0supporting bitcoin transactions into space. That startup is not off to a good start. As bitcoin remains volatile, with onetime advocates of the digital currency predicting a doomsday\xa0scenario, many businesses have turned their attention to the blockchain.\xa0With Bloq, Garzik must compete with other ventures vying for the few programmers well-versed in working with the blockchain, a decentralized online ledger\xa0for logging\xa0transactions that involve bitcoin or just about anything else. "There are less than 200 people who know the blockchain very well," he\xa0said. International Business Machines Corp.\xa0and Samsung Electronics Co. have\xa0collaborated on blockchain technology. Others, such as Chain, Factom, Digital Asset Holdings, and Overstock.com, are developing new applications that tie into the blockchain.

Bloq has five customers, including bitcoin startups Circle Internet Financial Ltd, ItBit Trust Company LLC, and KnCMiner AB, and\xa0expects to soon add\xa0Foxconn Technology Group, which assembles iPhones and other electronics. Garzik\xa0said Bloq has raised less than $250,000 from his\xa0co-founder Matt Roszak\'s Tally Capital.

While JPX and IBM plan to eventually implement the technology in financial transactions, JPX made clear in a statement that the two companies are in the experimentation phase and will first conduct proof-of-concept tests in markets with low transaction volume. \u201cThere are issues to be resolved in the technology, and it will need to be continually verified and improved before actual application in financial business operations,\u201d JPX said.

As Silicon Valley entrepreneurs dream up ways to disrupt the financial-services business, bankers and Wall Street companies are taking patents very seriously. \u201cThere is so much innovation in finance right now that if you want to stay ahead and maintain an edge, you have to patent it,\u201d says Linda Coven, a banking and payments analyst at research firm Aite Group. The biggest U.S. banks, including Bank of America, and payments networks such as MasterCard are applying for more patents than ever before on everything from mobile wallets to blockchain ledgers similar to those used for the digital currency bitcoin. Banks and payments companies were awarded 1,192\xa0patents over the past three years, 36\xa0percent more than the prior three-year period, according to researcher Envision\xa0IP. They\u2019re also hosting seminars for the U.S. patent office to head off what the industry sees as bad patents that cover age-old banking practices. By showing the examiners how the industry already operates, the banks hope the office won\u2019t grant patents to applicants with similar ideas. Tech companies from Apple to Google have for years fought patent wars over smartphone features, search technology, and computer chips. Banks largely ignored the patent office and gained a reputation for keeping their internal processes to themselves. That secrecy has become a problem. In 2011 the nation\u2019s banks and stock exchanges were sued by an independent patent owner over the way they encode and transmit data related to billions of transactions every day. Banks spent millions of dollars to successfully fight the claim. After a few dozen suits like that, banks decided they needed to intervene before patents were issued. \u201cThere was this frustration of \u2018Why is that patent out there?\u2019\u2009\u201d says Sean Reilly, general counsel of Askeladden, a group set up to address patent issues by the Clearing House, a payments company owned by the biggest U.S. banks. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are among the companies scouring old computer files and boxes of documents to create a database that shows the evolution\xa0of\xa0modern banking practices. A 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling found that automating a concept or practice wasn\u2019t enough to win a patent. But the focus on claiming intellectual property isn\u2019t only about fighting lawsuits over existing processes. Banks also want to beat back competitors as they and tech-driven startups experiment with ways to lend, make trades, and conduct mobile banking. \u201cIt\u2019s all stemming from the fact that banks are no longer your standard brick-and-mortar company that holds your money,\u201d says Binal Patel, a patent lawyer at Banner & Witcoff. \u201cThey\u2019re touching pretty much anything that Silicon Valley seems to be touching.\u201d Banks often team up with tech companies\u2014JPMorgan did a deal with online lender On Deck Capital to offer small-business loans\u2014but they know today\u2019s ally may be tomorrow\u2019s rival. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly the suggestion that, \u2018If we don\u2019t protect our innovations like the Silicon Valley innovations, we\u2019re going to be left behind, and they\u2019re going to take over our industry,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Jeff Berkowitz, a patent lawyer with the firm Finnegan. Bank of America has won the most patents among U.S. banks in recent years, with an active portfolio of more than 3,000. These include patents covering blockchains, a wearable financial indicator such as a watch, and automated teller machines that can be operated by a smartphone. MasterCard applied for 500 last year, 10 times the number in 2010, according to Colm Dobbyn, head of the company\u2019s patent program. The patent office welcomes the attention. The Bank of America seminar was part of the agency\u2019s effort to provide more technical training for examiners. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Google, and Tesla have also held sessions for patent office\xa0workers. Until a 1998 court ruling opened the door to more business-method and software patents, most finance patents weren\u2019t allowed. Once they were, the patent office still didn\u2019t have access to information on how financial companies operated. Sometimes the companies themselves struggled to document the things they had already been doing before a patent applicant came along. Michael Zoppo, a patent lawyer with Fish & Richardson, recalls a case over an automated version of something trading-pit workers had been doing for years. \u201cNobody writes that down,\u201d he says. \u201cThey talk about it over drinks.

That inspired Nolan to create Student.com, a London-based company that lets the increasing number of students studying outside their home country shop for accommodations. On Thursday, Student.com said it has received $60 million in funding from Dubai-based VY Capital and a group of investors that include Horizons Ventures, the technology investment arm of Chinese billionaire Li Ka-Shing\u2019s fund and London-based startup adviser Expa. Also participating in the funding round are Spotify\u2019s co-founders, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, as well as Hugo Barra, a former Google executive who helped run the Android operating system and is now at Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi Corp. In the upcoming academic year, Student.com will boost its listed properties to 426 cities around the world from about 300 now. It will use the funds from the investment to grow in new markets and expand in the U.S., the Middle East and Latin America. The cash infusion will also allow the company to make key hires, Nolan said in an interview, adding to the 200 employees in offices in seven cities, including New York, Shanghai and Hong Kong. In 2014, Nolan brought in Shakil Khan, a London-based entrepreneur who had served as an adviser to Spotify and co-founded popular Bitcoin exchange and wallet CoinDesk, as a co-founder to help direct strategy. Nolan and Khan had met 10 years earlier when they were both studying Mandarin in Shanghai. Student.com currently is free for students to use. It charges landlords who rent properties on the site a commission that varies depending on local market conditions, Nolan said. He said the company carefully vets landlords to make sure they are offering high-quality accommodations. The website also helps landlords present their properties, sending professional photographers to take pictures and aiding in writing profiles for the service. "We want to make sure the property owner has the right standards and the right ethos," Nolan said. He said each property was checked to make sure it was well maintained and clean, that it was safe and that it was not too far from the university it claimed to be serving. Last year, $110 million worth of housing was booked through the Student.com\u2019s platform from students in more than 100 countries, according to the company. Nolan said some of the largest groups of students using the site are from China, India and Nigeria and the most popular study destinations to date are in the U.K., U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Student.com is seeking to capitalize on the growing numbers of people seeking education abroad. Currently some 5 million students are studying outside their native country and that number is growing 6.4 percent annually, according to the company.

The new venture had already raised $52 million from firms including JPMorgan, Accenture Plc, Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. and Citigroup Inc. Last month, it won a contract to radically speed up settlement for Australia\u2019s stock market on behalf of ASX Ltd., another investor. The investments from Goldman and International Business Machines Corp. bring the total sum raised by the company to $60 million, according to a statement released on Tuesday. When the funding deal was initially announced in January, it valued Digital Asset at $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm is among about a dozen startups that are racing to prove that blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin, can be used in financial markets. While securities trading today relies on a central authority to oversee the transfer of cash for shares, Digital Asset aims to link all the participants in the process on the same database to allow real-time movement of assets. While the aim in Australia is to reduce settlement times to minutes, regulators in the U.S. are currently working to cut it to two days from three. IBM and Digital Asset are also members of a group of financial and technology companies that are advocating the development of open-source software. The group, which is working with the Linux Foundation, wants to create a public network that blockchain applications can use to communicate with each other. The deal with ASX, Australia\u2019s main exchange operator, is the boldest attempt yet to prove the worth of a so-called distributed ledger system.

The 39-year-old, a former bodyguard for Israeli political leaders, was commuting between Tel Aviv and New York, where he worked at a security firm. He kept ending up with spare change in his pockets just as he was leaving the country where he could spend it. \u201cEverything you buy in the U.S. costs something and 99 cents,\u201d he said. "I got stuck with thousands of pennies." He figured other international travelers probably had the same problem. So he founded TravelersBox in 2012 to install ATM-like kiosks in airports around the world. The machines take foreign coins or bills and convert them into digital currency that can be donated to charity, put into PayPal accounts or converted into gift cards from companies such as Starbucks Corp. and Sephora. By the end of the year, Zussman plans to have about 300 of his bright orange kiosks in Asia, North America and Europe. The company, based in Gibraltar, is launching a Hong Kong office and making Asia its main focus, particularly to cater to the growing numbers of upwardly mobile Chinese travelers. Zussman\u2019s father was an entrepreneur in Israel and the son tagged along to meetings. He didn\u2019t go into business directly though, spending five years in the Israeli secret service after a mandatory stint in the military. He traveled the world and guarded leaders such Ariel Sharon, an experience he says gave him more confidence and capability to work under pressure. Though his wife and three children live in central Israel, Zussman spends most of his time on planes these days to get his company going. His children use flight tracking software to monitor his movements and post the cities he\u2019s visited on a wall map. He\u2019s on his second startup, after leaving the security firm. The first was a social networking site for football fans called MyStadium. It didn\u2019t last long, but he learned two important lessons: Don\u2019t build a startup solo and make sure your investors can be good mentors too. After his brainstorm about loose change, Zussman started checking into what people do with leftover foreign money. Currency booths at airports are ubiquitous of course, but they typically won\u2019t take change and extract high fees. Charities often try to solicit donations of spare change, but they don\u2019t get much, he said. The opportunity seemed enormous. By his back-of-the-envelope calculation, billions of travelers per year are carrying hundreds of millions of dollars in change. He started the company with Dror Blumenthal and Idan Deshe, roommates who set up and then sold a digital advertising agency. Originally, Zussman and his co-founders thought they could create a service to let people swipe credit cards and deposit spare change right into their accounts. But credit card companies didn\u2019t see the point and processing fees were too high to make it work. \u201cIt turns out, $3 is nothing,\u201d he said. Next, he approached the Israeli office of\xa0digital-wallet company PayPal Holdings Inc. and quickly had a deal. Once they were on board, he signed up another 80 merchants, including American Airlines Group Inc., The Gap Inc. and Skype. One of his earliest backers was Yuval Tal, the founder and president of Payoneer, an Internet-based payment company, and BorderFree, an e-commerce company owned by Pitney Bowes Inc. That opened the door to other investors. TravelersBox last month raised $10 million from investors including the Hong Kong-based venture firm Arbor Ventures and Global Blue Holding BV, a duty free refund and shopping firm. The company is now valued at $30 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. Zussman\u2019s original assessment of the market may not be far off. Travelers lose an average of $285 a year from unused foreign currency after trips abroad, and an additional $80 of lost loose change, according to a Visa Inc. survey. The International Air Transport Association estimates there were 3.5 billion domestic and international air passengers in 2015. \u201cWe think the potential size of the market is in excess of $45 billion globally,\u201d Melissa Guzy, founding partner of Arbor Ventures said in an e-mail. \u201cWe invested in TBX since we believe that the conversion of unused foreign currency to a digital wallet such as Paypal or Tenpay or a Starbucks card is very appealing to international travelers.\u201d Others are skeptical. The business will require substantial investments for an uncertain payoff. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting concept and I think relatively straightforward execution strategy, I just wonder how big the potential market is,\u201d Zennon Kapron, managing director of the Shanghai consultant Kapronasia wrote in an e-mail. \u201cHeavily capital intensive, too, as the machines, space and connectivity can\u2019t be cheap.\u201d\xa0 One similar business is Outerwall Inc., formerly Coinstar Inc. It operates more than 64,000 kiosks for renting movies and cashing in coins, though typically not foreign currency. The Bellevue, Washington-based company has struggled to maintain profits and seen its shares slide in recent months. About $200,000 in cash is deposited in TravelersBox machines each month, with the average transaction rising from $3 to $18 after they started accepting bills, Zussman said. Second time users typically put in $75 at a time, and the maximum limit is $800 to avoid the added regulatory burden of anti-money laundering regulations. The company is experimenting with bitcoin as well. Zussman said the firm takes 7 percent from customers, compared with airport exchanges that can charge more than 10 percent on major currencies. His company also collects a commission from merchants that it partners with. The next move is to integrate his service at duty-free stores or other services outside airports, where customers could opt at the register to have their change go directly to a digital account or gift card. \u201cMy vision is that we be at every place that has physical money that can become digital,\u201d he said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/beijingscribe', 'name': u'Shai Oster', 'twitterhandle': u'beijingscribe'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-02/spare-a-dime-ex-bodyguard-builds-startup-backed-by-loose-change', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 2, 23, 0, 0, 3000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Ex-Bodyguard Turns Spare Change Into Digital Cash Startup'}, {'articleText': u' Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., the organization that processes all trades in the $22 trillion U.S. stock market, said the financial industry should collaborate to modernize its systems with the blockchain software that powers bitcoin. It\u2019s another significant endorsement for the technology, which promises to radically speed up and simplify trade clearing and settlement -- the process of swapping assets between buyers and sellers. Last week, DTCC was among a group of investors that bought stakes in Digital Asset Holdings, which is developing financial applications for blockchain, at the same time the startup won a contract to handle stock settlement in the Australian stock market. Blockchain could help DTCC leapfrog the industry\u2019s current best-case scenario for speeding up U.S. stock and bond trades. The present target is shifting to two days from three. Reducing settlement times frees up capital at brokerages and ensures investors get their money faster after a sale. DTCC said Monday that while the technology has its limitations, Wall Street should its explore its application to markets. \u201cThe industry should seize the emergence of this technology as an opportunity to assess how to modernize and significantly lower risk and cost,\u201d DTCC, which also clears bond transactions in the U.S., said in a research paper. \u201cDTCC strongly believes that the financial services industry has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine and modernize its infrastructure to address long-standing operational challenges.\u201d DTCC got a board seat at Digital Asset as it invested in the startup, which is run by former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker Blythe Masters. Digital Asset\u2019s deal last week with the Australian Stock Exchange is the biggest announcement yet concerning the use of blockchain in financial markets, following more than a year of enthusiastic talk about how distributed ledgers, which are sometimes referred to as blockchains, can transform finance. DTCC is instrumental in the process of exchanging cash for securities such as stocks or bonds. It said it\u2019s identified several areas where distributed ledgers could improve efficiency, including data management, confirming trades, netting and clearing, collateral management and settlement. According to DTCC, current techniques are vulnerable to cyber attack, susceptible to duplicate records and unnecessarily complex. They also aren\u2019t available 24 hours a day. \u201cThe premise of the Bitcoin platform -- a decentralized, trustless, replicated ledger of transactions -- is the virtual opposite of the centralized, trusted, guarded, model of modern securities processing, which has long relied upon DTCC, among others, as a central authority,\u201d DTCC said. Distributed ledgers face obstacles to success. Fierce competitors will need to collaborate. Regulatory hurdles could kill or significantly slow progress. And although cross-border payment networks could save banks money, it would also drain revenue away from other parts of their business. The state of distributed ledger technology needs to improve to be able to handle the scale of modern financial markets, DTCC said. \u201cIt is immature, unproven, has inherent scale limitations in its current form and lacks underlying infrastructure to cleanly integrate it into the existing financial market environment,\u201d the firm said. But the positives appear to outweigh the negatives. \u201cDTCC believes that distributed ledger technologies have the potential to address certain limitations of the current post-trade process by modernizing, streamlining and simplifying the siloed design of the financial industry infrastructure with a shared fabric of common information,\u201d the organization said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mattleising', 'name': u'Matthew Leising', 'twitterhandle': u'mattleising'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-25/wall-street-urged-by-key-utility-to-mull-upgrade-to-blockchain', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 25, 16, 36, 42, 251000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Wall Street Urged by Key Utility to Mull Upgrade to Blockchain'}, {'articleText': u' Last Thursday night, almost 200 entrepreneurs jammed an auditorium in London\u2019s East End where Barclays Plc unveiled the 11 ventures chosen for its latest financial-technology boot camp. The winners described their startups like contestants on a business version of the X Factor, drawing applause from the crowd. There was Cuvva Ltd., a firm that delivers auto insurance through a smartphone app in less than a minute, and DigiSEq Ltd., which lets consumers make payments with wearable devices. Perhaps the biggest surprise was the one led by the guy in the dark pinstripe suit. Lee Braine, a senior manager in Barclays\u2019s investment bank, has been trying to figure out how to harness the blockchain, the software underpinning bitcoin, to handle securities transactions with greater speed and efficiency. This week, he and a few colleagues are leaving the British bank\u2019s glass and steel tower at Canary Wharf and pitching camp with the other startups for 13 weeks in an Edwardian-era building in scruffy Whitechapel, down the street from a kebab shop. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hype out there on this technology and our goal is to cut through that and look for the real business applications in the capital markets," Braine, 48, explained as fellow techies cracked beers and scooped up slices of pizza after the presentations. \u201cTo do that we have to be open. What we have to do is co-creation. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d The stakes are big: Online lending is growing 151 percent annually, payment and cash-transfer apps like Apple Pay and Facebook Messenger are multiplying and some experts predict blockchain technology will rewire the financial industry\u2019s infrastructure. Banks and insurers could lose as much as $150 billion in revenue to startups by 2025, consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimated. This latest challenge comes as the biggest lenders are already reeling from the impact of tougher regulation and record-low interest rates. It wasn\u2019t long ago that banks kept their research and development in-house, and built their systems behind closed doors.\xa0Now Citigroup Inc., UBS Group AG, Wells Fargo & Co., and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA are among some two-dozen financial giants hosting accelerators, hackathons and competitions to bring startups to their doors. \u201cThe story has gone from one of competition to one of collaboration," says Julian Skan, a managing director at Accenture Plc in London. "Many fintech startups will end up being used as widgets by the banks." Yet doubts remain whether the approach will yield rewards. Banks probably spend more than $1 million a year to host accelerator programs, estimates Oliwia Berdak, a senior analyst with Forrester Research Inc. in London. While that\u2019s puny relative to the billions lenders deploy on their annual IT budgets, the boot camps also demand time and energy from banking personnel.\xa0It took months for the Barclays Accelerator\u2019s team to sort through the 684 applicants from 77 nations for the latest session. Dozens of executives will also spend time mentoring the startups. Born in Silicon Valley a decade ago, accelerators have helped launch companies such as Airbnb Inc., Dropbox Inc., and Sphero Inc., the toy company that made the rolling robot in the latest Star Wars film. But these are the exceptions, and whether the concept will pay off for the finance industry is open to question, especially as the programs don\u2019t lend themselves to precise measurements. \u201cExecutives running accelerators will struggle to show a return on investment,\u201d says Berdak. Even if banks unearth breakthroughs, it will be hard to plug them into their operations, says Clayton Christensen, author of The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma. Saddled with aging technology and inflexible management practices, banks will struggle to integrate new platforms and business models, he says.\xa0 \u201cThe processes in a bank are excruciatingly interdependent," says Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School. "When you change one thing you have to get your arms around everything else. It paralyzes you." Most lenders have long left the development of new products and tech programs to individual divisions, according to McKinsey & Co. The heads of innovation hubs located in Citigroup\u2019s businesses didn\u2019t even know each other until 2013, says Deborah Hopkins, the bank\u2019s chief innovation officer and head of Citi Ventures, based in Palo Alto, California. \u201cThere was a huge amount of duplicate and triplicate work across the labs,\u201d she says. Hopkins linked the labs and connected them with Citi Ventures\u2019 investment arm and its accelerator program, which she helped launch in Tel Aviv in 2013. Now she\u2019s established a route for startups through Citi\u2019s vast organization. In 2014, Hopkins helped DocuSign Inc., a San Francisco-based firm that uses digital signatures to eliminate paperwork, find its way to the bank\u2019s consumer-operations team and secure a global contract. \u201cWe\u2019re the sherpas that will take entrepreneurs up the mountain,\u201d Hopkins says. Other banks are intensifying their efforts, sometimes at the highest level.\xa0Last month, UBS Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti and three other members of the executive committee quizzed the founders of startups competing in the bank\u2019s first Future of Finance Challenge in Zurich.\xa0The winner, Aesthetic Integration Ltd., uses artificial intelligence to analyze trading strategies, and is developing a pilot program with UBS. "We\u2019re still in the infancy of this," Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America Corp.,\xa0said in a roundtable discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. "That\u2019s why we partner with people, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing $3 billion in technology development, in coding, every year." Barclays opened its accelerator in 2013 in a partnership with Techstars, a Boulder, Colorado-based company. With programs in London, New York, Tel Aviv and Cape Town, South Africa, Barclays runs the biggest such effort in finance. The accelerator offers startups a $100,000 loan, $20,000 for living expenses, workspace, server space, and a "network catalyst" who helps them connect with other entrepreneurs. Techstars, which runs 23 accelerators worldwide, takes a 6 percent equity stake in the enterprises. Barclays has used the program to fill specific R&D needs. In early 2015, Troels Oerting, the group chief information security officer,\xa0requested a cybersecurity startup.\xa0The accelerator unearthed more than two-dozen candidates and Oerting helped select a company called Post-Quantum for the bank\u2019s second program last fall. The London-based firm specializing in encryption is now developing a business plan that could lead to a contract with Barclays. Companies selected for the Barclays program have run the gamut, from older ones with paying customers to a blockchain startup designed on the back of a beer coaster. Chris Adelsbach, a Techstars managing director who runs the accelerator, says having Braine\u2019s team inside adds a new wrinkle. "They\u2019ll soak up the atmosphere, take advantage of the network, and try to accomplish something big," says Adelsbach.\xa0 That\u2019s the real test for these programs. \u201cAre banks using accelerators as a public relations exercise to show they\u2019re doing something, or are they going to truly rewire their businesses?\u201d says Rhydian Lewis, a former M&A banker at Lazard and co-founder of Ratesetter, a London-based online lender. \u201cThat\u2019s the big question.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/@EddieRob235', 'name': u'Edward Robinson', 'twitterhandle': u'@EddieRob235'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/man-in-pinstripe-suit-has-13-weeks-to-get-tech-magic-to-barclays', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 27, 1, 0, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'The Startups Hiding in UBS, Citigroup and Barclays'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-01-22/china-considers-rival-to-bitcoin', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' The International Monetary Fund extolled the potential benefits of virtual currencies and said they warrant a more nuanced regulatory approach, at a time when the future of bitcoin, the most well-known example, is in doubt. \u201cVirtual currencies and their underlying technologies can provide faster and cheaper financial services, and can become a powerful tool for deepening financial inclusion in the developing world,\u201d IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a statement Wednesday to accompany the report.

The call for more enlightened regulation and increasing mainstream acceptance comes as a split among the core developers of bitcoin\xa0threatens the world\u2019s most popular virtual currency. \u201cI will no longer be taking part in bitcoin development and have sold all my coins,\u201d Mike Hearn, a high-profile developer, wrote in a post on Medium last week. Bitcoin \u201chas failed because the community has failed.\u201d The disagreement revolves around transaction size limits and has divided the community into several camps such as Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic, each representing a different way to structure its decentralized public ledger. The price of bitcoin dropped more than 10 percent after Hearn\u2019s post, according to research from CoinDesk. It traded at about $379 on Jan. 20, about a third of its peak in 2013. Regardless of whether bitcoin survives the crisis, the IMF concluded in its report that virtual currencies are here to stay. They will come in many shapes and flavors, ranging from smartphone coins for in-game purchases tightly controlled by publishers to pseudo-anonymous cryptography-driven currencies with no central authority. The ability to securely carry out transactions without central oversight, known as blockchain technology, could reduce costs of international transfers, shorten wait times and enable smart contracts, according to the report, which was\xa0presenting to a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

The People\u2019s Bank of China set up a research team in 2014 to study digital currencies and application scenarios, according to a statement posted on the regulator\u2019s website. The PBOC said it has consulted with experts from Citigroup Inc. and Deloitte LLP, though it didn\u2019t specify what technology it would be using to issue its digital currency or how it would work in relation to the yuan. Digital currencies have gained prominence with the rise of bitcoin, which is mined with high-powered computers and operates with a distributed ledger that contains the payment history of every circulation. China has become one of the biggest markets for bitcoin and miners, as Chinese regulators have largely taken a hands-off approach with bitcoin exchanges and businesses. \u201cThey\u2019ve recognized the opportunities the digital currencies have,\u201d said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia. \u201cIf they did have something the government could monitor and use, that could fit into their longer-term plans.\u201d An estimated $843 billion of capital flowed out of China in the 11 months through November, according to a Bloomberg estimate, and policy makers are having to add funds to the financial system to prevent interest rates rising amid an economic slowdown. Early bitcoin adopters envisioned the currency as a means to obtain freedom from control from central banks and financial institutions. Bitcoin was created in 2008 under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, a programmer or a group of programmers, and does not operate an administer, like a central bank. Rather a network of volunteers validate transactions via their computers, which require encrypted electronic signatures, and in return earn fees based on market prices. \u201cRight now it\u2019s too early to see what effect PBOC\u2019s move will have on China\u2019s bitcoin community," said Wang Chun, Beijing-based co-founder of the world\u2019s second-largest bitcoin mining pool F2Pool. "They could decide to let bitcoin co-exist with its own digital currency, or chose to crack down on it." The price of bitcoin rose 1.6 percent to $413 as of 4:15 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The digital currency surged 36 percent last year. The Philippines is already trying to use blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin to issue its own digital currency. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. wants to become the first major exchange operator to use blockchain technology. Often when a revolutionary technology first enters the public realm, it emboldens early adopters, said Charles Mok, an IT advocate who serves on the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Still, commercialization of the new technology needed to make it available to the masses fuels property rights and government enforced rules, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a tug of war between the government, the regulators and non-government organizations,\u201d said Mok. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that governments will say they want to come because of the financial market impact, they want to protect consumers.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/luluyilun', 'name': u'Lulu Yilun Chen', 'twitterhandle': u'luluyilun'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-21/chinese-central-bank-studies-prospect-of-own-digital-currency', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 21, 4, 51, 10, 587000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'China Mulls Answer to Bitcoin With Digital Currency Study'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-01-21/blythe-masters-raises-cash-to-reshape-finance-industry', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' Digital Asset Holdings, the blockchain startup run by former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker Blythe Masters, raised $52 million from investors and won a contract to radically speed up settlement in Australia\u2019s stock market. The deal with ASX Ltd., Australia\u2019s main exchange operator, is the boldest attempt yet to prove the worth of a so-called distributed ledger system. ASX agreed to invest A$14.9 million ($10.5 million) into Digital Asset, joining other investors including JPMorgan, CME Group Inc. and ICAP Plc. The funding round was more than two times oversubscribed and values New York-based Digital Asset at $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Digital Asset is among about a dozen startups that are racing to prove that blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin, can be applied to financial markets. While in today\u2019s securities markets a central authority oversees the transfer of cash for shares, DAH aims to link all participants in that process on the same database to allow real-time movement of assets. While the aim in Australia is to reduce settlement times to minutes, regulators in the U.S. are currently working to cut it to two days from three. \u201cWe can now trade equities in 150 microseconds, then it takes two days tosettle. That makes no sense,\u201d Elmer Funke Kupper, chief executive officer of ASX, said in an interview. \u201cA retail investor in Australia should be able to sell their shares, go to the nearest ATM and get their cash out.\u201d ASX said a year ago that it would replace all of its core technology systems. Digital Asset beat out 400 applicants for the contract to remake its clearing and settlement system. The Australian company invested about $10 million in Digital Asset, Funke Kupper said. \u201cThe moment we started to think about it, we realized that this is about muchmore than replacing our back-office systems,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first opportunity in 20 years to re-engineer the way the market operates end-to-end. We should not miss that opportunity.\u201d After more than a year of enthusiastic talk about how the blockchain or distributed ledgers can transform finance, 2016 looks to be the year when those ideas are put to the test. Earlier this week, R3, a blockchain startup backed by 42 banks, said it successfully simulated trades of digital assets on a private network made up of 11 of its members. Overstock.com Inc. is close to unveiling the first securities-trading system using blockchain, while Nasdaq Inc. recently said it used the technology to complete and record a private securities transaction for the first time. \u201cFrom the outside this looks like the first real application of blockchain in a major clearing operation,\u201d said Rich Repetto, an exchange and brokerage analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP in New York. He said that so far it appears Nasdaq and ASX are out front in this new technology. \u201cIt\u2019s still early, but if anyone\u2019s going to get there it\u2019ll be the ones who are aggressive from the start,\u201d he said. The other investors in Digital Asset are Accenture Plc, Deutsche Boerse AG, Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., Citigroup Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Banco Santander SA and ABN AMRO Group NV. The board of directors of Digital Asset will grow to nine members from four, with added representatives from BNP Paribas, Deutsche Boerse, JPMorgan and DTCC and one as yet to be named, Masters said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique cross-section of investors and customers who are investing a material amount of money in a technology that has the potential to transform their businesses,\u201d she said. Regarding the ASX investment and project, Masters said, \u201cIt\u2019s the first real, large-scale commercial project for any distributed ledger business. This is the first instance of something that\u2019s much more than hype.\u201d Distributed ledgers face obstacles to success. Fierce competitors will need to collaborate. Regulatory hurdles could kill or significantly slow progress. And although cross-border payment networks could save banks money, it would also drain revenue away from other parts of their business. Another challenge is integrating new technology into existing systems, Masters said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. On the plus side, she said, distributed ledgers can make markets easier to regulate. \u201cThere\u2019s the opportunity to enhance what regulators see and receive so you actually add to transparency,\u201d she said. Other financial products that could be overhauled using blockchain include fixed income, syndicated loans, foreign exchange settlements, and derivatives, Masters said. ASX was granted the right to purchase warrants to increase its equity stake in Digital Asset and appoint a board member if certain conditions are met, Masters said. Two other types of warrants exist, according to a person familiar with the matter. The first are revenue warrants that would be rewarded to any customer or investor who brings in sales for Digital Asset, the person said. The second type of warrant was issued to JPMorgan and can be exercised only if the bank works exclusively with Digital Asset on two different products that result in their widespread adoption, the person said. They were issued at the same cost of the other investments and all early investors had the chance to receive the warrants if they agreed to the terms, the person said. JPMorgan invested about $7.5 million in the round, according to a person familiar with the matter. Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment. ASX is introducing blockchain to the world\u2019s 12th-biggest stock market, as measured by the $917 billion value of companies listed in Australia. Funke Kupper said he knew how difficult it will be to implement such a large change to his exchange. \u201cWe will need the support from investors, our clients, regulators and the government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start a journey of discovery. We don\u2019t know where it will end, but we know where it begins.

The company, best known as a discount retailer, will issue a digital version of its own stock that can then be traded on Pro Securities LLC, an alternative trading system Overstock invested in in 2014,\xa0Chief Executive Officer Patrick Byrne said in an interview. Because it\u2019s bypassing traditional exchanges like the Nasdaq Stock Market and New York Stock Exchange, the trades will clear nearly instantaneously instead of taking several days. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to start a crypto Wall Street,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cLike Jonas Salk injecting himself with polio, our first client is going to be ourselves.\u201d The firm is completing its regulatory approval process with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Byrne said. At first, only the new type of Overstock equity will be available to trade via blockchain, but Byrne is hoping other companies follow suit. Pro Securities will also be available to list the shares of private companies and bonds, he said. Nasdaq Inc. is swimming in similar waters. At the end of December, the exchange operator said it used blockchain technology to complete and record a private securities transaction for the first time. Chain.com became the first user of Nasdaq\u2019s Linq blockchain when it issued shares to a private investor. After more than a year of enthusiastic talk about how the blockchain, or distributed ledgers, can transform how Wall Street trades and settles financial products, 2016 looks to be the year where those ideas are put to the test. Firms such as ItBit and Symbiont are seeking to release applications this year that use digital ledger technology to improve how a range of assets are traded and settled. Wall Street firms see the technology as a way to reduce costs and increase efficiency as they face stricter regulatory requirements following the 2008 financial crisis. Other firms such as Ripple are already allowing customers to move money internationally in minutes rather than days by utilizing a distributed ledger system. A distributed ledger allows transactions to be processed so quickly because all the users are connected through its network. As long as banks or exchanges, all of whom are known to each other, verify that one company has the funds or assets to transact with another company, the settlement and clearing time is reduced to seconds. That contrasts with the current banking system with firms that are walled off from each other and connected through decades-old payment services, causing rather simple processes to take several days to complete.

When the virtual currency\'s popularity was surging just a few years ago, almost anyone could set up a computer in their basement to mine bitcoins, a process needed to record transactions and ensure the propagation of the digital money, which exists as software. Miners who put their machines to work solving complex computational problems (and paying for the hardware and a higher electric bill) were rewarded with new bitcoins for their efforts. Some became paper millionaires as bitcoin\'s price jumped to a peak of $1,137 in 2013 from $13 in less than two years. Then, bitcoin\'s price plummeted to a low of $183 last year, leaving only major miners with significant resources in the game. Many found it more profitable to join mining pools, or groups of miners that share computing power to harvest new bitcoins faster and more efficiently. Now, there are signs that broader mining efforts are making a comeback, thanks to bitcoin\'s price doubling since\xa0September. While that isn\'t the only factor that determines whether mining is profitable, it\'s an important one. "When the price goes up, there\'s more confidence in mining, and [mining equipment makers] go and design the next-generation chips," said Bobby Lee, chief executive officer of BTCC, a bitcoin exchange based in Shanghai. "For people who already bought equipment, their ROI will increase." BTCC also operates the world\'s second-largest bitcoin-mining pool. Genesis Mining, which has more than 130,000 people buying computing power on its mining hardware to participate the mining process, is seeing higher returns. An investment of $419 yielded a return of about $2.42 a day in November, up from $1.14 in September. At higher bitcoin prices, a speculator would be able to recoup his or her money in\xa0about six months, instead of more than a year. "In a price-rising scenario, you can see demand that\'s tripling," says CEO Marco Streng. "And sometimes even higher." It\'s a risky endeavor. Bitcoin prices are notoriously volatile. Also, this year bitcoin\'s software is scheduled to reduce by a half the number of coins that get rewarded for mining activities (part of a built-in supply regulating systems). At the same time, more powerful, and therefore expensive, equipment will be needed to keep up with the processing power required to mine bitcoins. For now though, the mining party is going strong.\xa0BTCC has seen the amount of computing power hooked onto its pool double in the past\xa0six months. "Everyone in our pool is making money, because people who aren\'t making money would not have their machines turned on," BTCC\'s Lee said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/olgakharif', 'name': u'Olga Kharif', 'twitterhandle': u'olgakharif'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-07/the-return-of-bitcoin-mining', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 7, 20, 43, 41, 272000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'The Return of Bitcoin Mining'}, {'articleText': u"  Taking Stock with Michael McKee and Kathleen Hays.

In two years, the foundation had seen\xa0at least $7 million evaporate.\xa0As of Nov. 30, its total assets stood at\xa0$12,553.06. To sustain the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s operations, which have included lobbying, putting on conferences, and providing technical support for the digital currency, Fenton urged the group to find ways to raise money quickly. They considered cold-calling ex-members, and Fenton\xa0said he\u2019s working on\xa0marketing materials\xa0for\xa0prospective donors to\xa0explain the organization\u2019s purpose.\xa0\u201cThere is no material saying what the foundation does,\u201d he said. Eventually, Jim Harper, a board member and senior fellow at Cato Institute, a think tank, interjected. He questioned whether the foundation was offering its members enough value to warrant its existence, according to minutes released\xa0on Dec. 21 from the meeting.\xa0\u201cAsking for money is just throwing money away,\u201d Harper said.\xa0Olivier Janssens, another director, suggested that the organization may not be \u201cfixable.\u201d The Bitcoin Foundation has become a symbol of the challenges\xa0facing the digital asset it was designed to steward. While advocates have promoted bitcoin as a global, decentralized currency for the Internet age, it\u2019s proved to be more volatile than many penny stocks. Its role in money laundering and other illegal\xa0activity is a constant source of questions, and the price fluctuates with each regulatory clampdown or criminal investigation. In November\xa02013, it reached a high\xa0of $1,137 before falling to $183 in January\xa02015 following\xa0a slew of problems, including the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest\xa0bitcoin exchange. Beyond financial trouble, two former Bitcoin Foundation board members have been charged with crimes. Mark Karpel\xe8s, former\xa0chief executive officer\xa0of Mt. Gox, was arrested in Tokyo and charged with embezzlement in September. Charlie Shrem, former vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, resigned before pleading guilty to helping launder money for transactions through\xa0the illicit online marketplace Silk Road. He\u2019s currently serving two years\xa0in a federal prison. Several people still involved with the Bitcoin Foundation said the wounds may never heal.\xa0\u201cI don't know if the foundation has a future,\u201d Gavin Andresen, a former board member who now holds the title of chief scientist, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cIt is very difficult to regain trust once trust has been lost, and the illegal behavior of two of the foundation's former board members destroyed a lot of trust.\u201d When the Bitcoin Foundation was formed in 2012, the group was intended to give legitimacy to a relatively unknown technology. By the end of that year, bitcoin traded at about $13. The organization grew almost in lockstep with the popularity of bitcoin. Comprising pioneering coders and entrepreneurs behind the digital currency, the Bitcoin Foundation would soon become a familiar face in Washington, spreading the gospel of bitcoin around the world. U.S. lawmakers and congressional committees appreciated having a central figure to represent bitcoin, but foundation members have sometimes become punching bags for politicians. At an event\xa0in 2013 attended by Andresen, who was appointed to lead bitcoin development by the anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto,\xa0a Justice Department prosecutor compared bitcoin with child pornography, according to a report in the\xa0Washington Post. Techies bought into the promises of bitcoin and were eager to donate to further its\xa0cause.\xa0At the end of 2013, the Bitcoin Foundation reported $7 million in assets, according to meeting minutes. As demand for bitcoins rose, so did the value of the foundation\u2019s funds, much of which were held in the digital currency. In 2014, its ambitions began expanding with the addition of a lobbying operation in Europe. Then things changed. By mid-2014, funds were down to $4.6 million, and the burst of the bitcoin bubble that year\xa0took a toll on the foundation almost immediately. \u201cI hired lobbying in Brussels in 2014, and then we scaled it right back because the money was gone,\u201d Harper said in an interview after the contentious Dec. 15 board meeting.\xa0According to the minutes from that meeting, the organization has cut its budget by 95 percent from previous years. Its conference business now faces stiff competition from other events, such as\xa0Inside Bitcoins and Money20/20. About a year ago, when bitcoin\u2019s price had fallen to about $374, the foundation said it would discontinue public policy efforts and concentrate on providing technical development to bitcoin. The reason was simple: It didn\u2019t have the money to do both.\xa0\u201cIt thrived while the bitcoin price was rising, so it never put a plan in place to sustain it,\u201d Harper\xa0said. \u201cWhen the price dropped, the foundation ran out of money. The last year has just been cutting costs, shrinking budgets, bringing things under control.\u201d The pressure revealed the foundation\u2019s underlying weaknesses. Supporters were inexperienced at\xa0raising money, and until recently, few paid attention to expenses, Harper said. \u201cThey were spending thousands of dollars per month on Web services that would have cost a couple hundred,\u201d he said. Bobby Lee, a Bitcoin Foundation board member, acknowledged \u201cbudget and leadership problems in the past\u201d and referred questions about expenses to Fenton, who said he\u2019s made the organization more transparent since he joined in April. \u201cThere were a lot of bad decisions and a lot of lost money,\u201d Fenton said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a very different organization. It\u2019s a new organization, other than the name.\u201d Bitcoin has weathered hard times better than the foundation has. The price is back up to $426. Venture capital firms have invested more than $1 billion in bitcoin-related startups, according to research from CoinDesk. Finance and tech companies, including IBM, Overstock, Nasdaq, and the biggest banks, are experimenting with the technology for use in everything from money transfers and contracts to issuing stock. Coin Center, a year-old organization with backers such as BitPay, has staff in Washington developing bitcoin policy. There\u2019s also the Digital Chamber of Commerce, a trade association. Those two organizations recently formed the Blockchain Alliance to help law enforcement investigate criminal activity involving bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology. Roger Ver, whose evangelism for the digital currency earned him the name Bitcoin Jesus, provided the Bitcoin Foundation with funds early on. An ex-convict who had been sentenced to 10 months in federal prison after selling about 14 pounds of explosives without a license on EBay, Ver said the foundation\u2019s demise, if it were to happen, wouldn\u2019t affect bitcoin. \u201cThere are lots of different bitcoin foundations, so the name may change, but the mission will carry on,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters at all if the Bitcoin Foundation were to close. The Bitcoin Foundation laid the groundwork for the ecosystem that we have today.\u201d But Lee is determined to\xa0resuscitate his organization. \u201cDespite the recent negativity about the Bitcoin Foundation, there are still many people who believe in the need for a global non-profit platform that advocates for bitcoin,\u201d Lee wrote in an e-mail. \u201cThe past 18 months were tough for bitcoin and its entire ecosystem; I did not give up on bitcoin then, and I will not give up on Bitcoin Foundation today.\u201d At the December board meeting, Lee suggested that dissenters should resign. \u201cIf someone does not want to be on that ship, they should step off the board,\u201d Lee said. After much debate, Janssens and Harper elected to dissolve the organization, but they were outvoted by Lee and the two other directors. By the end of the meeting, Harper agreed to step down, and Janssens was removed from the board. \u201cNone of this is personal,\u201d said Chairman Brock Pierce.

Plunging oil prices, the Federal Reserve\u2019s first rate increase since before the financial crisis and the collapse in junk-rated debt are creating opportunities for some bankers and traders, spurring hiring and raises. Analysts, recruiters and executives deem these the best jobs to have in 2016: Investment bankers advised a record $4.2 trillion of announced mergers and acquisitions in 2015, led by blockbuster deals in pharmaceuticals, telecom and technology companies. Which industry is ripe for the next wave of consolidation? Battered by oil\u2019s plunge, energy companies will need to lean on bankers in 2016 to shore up equity or sell themselves to stronger rivals. \u201cWhen an industry blows up, you usually get a couple of really good years,\u201d said Brian Foran, a partner at Autonomous Research LLP. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to banks in 2008 and 2009, when you had some of the biggest acquisitions ever and it was phenomenal for financial institutions bankers.\u201d Rising defaults, widening spreads on high-yield debt and climbing U.S. interest rates mean restructuring desks have a big year ahead, according to Vincent Hung of Autonomous Research. Those bankers advise debtors or creditors when companies need restructuring through asset-sales or in bankruptcy. Boutiques including Houlihan Lokey Inc. and Lazard Ltd. dominate the field (megabanks are more often conflicted as creditors or underwriters), and the firms could see a 24 percent jump in restructuring revenue next year, Hung said in a Dec. 18 note. Rates traders already are poised for some of this year\u2019s biggest raises, with those handling options due for a 15 percent increase on average, according to recruiting firm Options Group Inc. Trading government bonds and related instruments should remain strong in 2016 as the Fed tightens monetary policy while the European Central Bank loosens it, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said this month. \u201cYou finally have an outlook where major central banks are going in different directions,\u201d Foran said. \u201cThat just creates a lot of activity.\u201d Banks need traders and quants to improve platforms that help clients make and manage bets across multiple assets and markets, said Jessica Lee, an Options Group director. \u201cA lot of hedge funds have done a better job than banks at integrating electronic platforms to trade cross-asset,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou have people at high-frequency trading platforms who\u2019ve never worked at a bank who are actually going to banks now.\u201d Those who jump from hedge funds can typically expect a 25 percent pay raise when joining a bank, she said. Bank executives talked a lot in 2015 about the need to learn from other industries that got decimated by Silicon Valley disruptors. Next year, more banks will unveil pilot programs that automate investment management and make use of technology based on bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, the software ledger that can speed up financial transactions. \u201cBanks are really aggressively hiring IT and data-management to do anything around blockchain\u201d and other financial-technology areas, said Robert Dicks, who runs the human capital practice for financials at Deloitte Consulting LLP. \u201cThey look at this as part of their infrastructure, part of the capabilities they need.\u201d Customer-data analysts, compliance analysts and cyber-security personnel also are in demand, he said. While investors have shown heightened skittishness this month about holding risky corporate debt such as leveraged loans, some areas of corporate financing are expected to flourish next year. Continued merger activity will drive investment-grade debt issuance, even with rates rising, Jim Amine, head of Credit Suisse Group AG\u2019s investment bank, said in October. He and others have predicted a pickup in private placements, and banks are increasing their efforts to market derivatives to corporations as they raise capital. Unless you\u2019re the star of the desk, it\u2019s good to be junior, according to recruiters. In the wake of the financial crisis, many departments slowed hiring and shrank, and workers who survived the cuts then stuck around longer to make up for lost earnings. That\u2019s left many desks with a dearth of employees with five to seven years of experience, warping the typical shape of organizations\u2019 ladders so that they\u2019re thin in the middle, said Paul Sorbera, president of New York-based search firm Alliance Consulting. Demand for analysts, associates and vice presidents \u201cis as strong as I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Sorbera said. By contrast, \u201cthere is an overwhelming amount of senior people in the barbell at the top.\u201d Top-producing financial advisers have never been more in demand.

The company needs time before it starts accepting Bitcoins in order to figure out how to process Bitcoin transactions and to hedge Bitcoin sales (the currency is highly volatile), he said. Introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoins exist as software, which contain the rules governing their supply. New Bitcoins can only be created by solving complex problems embedded in the currency, keeping total growth limited. There are more than 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks activity across various exchanges.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in congressional testimony last month that the central bank has no authority to regulate Bitcoin. Still, there could be room for digital currencies to replace traditional payments processors by offering cheaper alternatives to electronically transferring money, Andolfatto said at a forum hosted at the regional Fed bank. Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, emerged from a 2008 paper written by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin network uses a public ledger to record transactions made under pseudonyms, a technological breakthrough that allows purchases and sales without using a trusted third party, such as Visa Inc. or Western Union Co. While a growing cadre of retailers are beginning to accept Bitcoin, recent events have underscored concerns about the viability of the currency. The governments of India, China and Russia have sought to ban or limit its use, and the Mt. Gox exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in February. Andolfatto said today the Fed has provided a fairly stable currency for 100 years and \u201cpassed the market test.\u201d The value of Bitcoin is prone to swings because a central authority can\u2019t issue more supply in times when demand for money soars, such as in a financial crisis, he said. Other Fed officials have weighed in recently on the rise of digital currencies. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said this month the U.S. approach is to \u201cobserve and understand how this technology if unfolding,\u201d adding that Bitcoin probably won\u2019t become widely used until it receives backing from an entity to help stabilize its value.

It\u2019s nice they are paying attention to it, and don\u2019t have a Bitcoin-is-evil view.\u201d Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua, the researchers at Goldman Sachs who wrote the report, said that the ability to pay for goods and services using Bitcoin is growing, saying that \u201cobstacles to Bitcoin being used more broadly in the payments system are arguably not insurmountable.\u201d Roman Leal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs covering information-technology services, said Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cbiggest hurdle\u201d will be maintaining its cost advantage in the face of greater regulation, higher operating costs, and competition from entrenched players. \u201cWhile it is too early to tell how banks and payment processors will react to the threat of Bitcoin, we believe that it is only a matter of time before major incumbents develop a digital currency strategy,\u201d Leal wrote.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-12/goldman-sachs-sees-bitcoin-s-promise-in-payments-over-currency', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 13, 0, 27, 2, 783000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Goldman Sachs Sees Bitcoin Future in Payments Over Money'}, {'articleText': u'  The U.S. government will treat Bitcoin as property for tax purposes, applying rules it uses to govern stocks and barter transactions, the Internal Revenue Service said in its first substantive ruling on the issue. Today\u2019s IRS guidance will provide certainty for Bitcoin investors, along with income-tax liability that wasn\u2019t specified before. Purchasing a $2 cup of coffee with Bitcoins bought for $1 would trigger $1 in capital gains for the coffee drinker and $2 of gross income for the coffee shop. The IRS, faced with a choice of treating Bitcoins like currency or property, chose property. That decision could reduce the volume of transactions conducted with the virtual currency, said Pamir Gelenbe, a venture partner at Hummingbird Ventures, which invests in technology businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging if you have to think about capital gains before you buy a cup of coffee,\u201d he said. Charles Allen, chief executive officer of BitcoinShop Inc., an online marketplace, said he\u2019d like to see the IRS reconsider its decision as virtual currencies develop. \u201cThe implications this decision will have on the Bitcoin ecosystem are far reaching, and will be burdensome for both individual users of Bitcoins, Bitcoin-focused business and for the general adoption of virtual currencies,\u201d he said, adding that Bitcoin users will adapt to the rules. Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, emerged from a 2008 paper written by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin network uses a public ledger to record transactions made under pseudonyms, a technological breakthrough that allows purchases and sales without using a trusted third party, such as Visa Inc. or Western Union Co. Powerful computers that record the transactions and guard against double-spending the same currency generate new Bitcoins, a process referred to as mining. Mining has made some early Bitcoin adopters wealthy in dollar terms. Others bought into the currency in early 2013, before its price rose more than 50-fold to peak at $1,200 in early December. A Bitcoin was worth $584.35 at 4:02 p.m., New York time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. That\u2019s less than 0.3 percent below today\u2019s high. The IRS ruling means Bitcoin investors will be treated like stock investors. Bitcoins held for more than a year and then sold would face the lower tax rates applicable to capital gains -- a maximum of 23.8 percent compared with the 43.4 percent top rate on property sold within a year of purchase. \u201cThe Internal Revenue Service\u2019s guidance today provides clarity for taxpayers who want to ensure that they\u2019re doing the right thing and playing by the rules when utilizing Bitcoin and other digital currencies,\u201d Senator Thomas Carper, a Delaware Democrat, said in a statement. For investors with losses, U.S. tax law allows taxpayers to subtract capital losses from any capital gains. They can also subtract as much as $3,000 of capital losses a year from ordinary income. If Bitcoin were treated as a foreign currency, ordinary -- not capital gains -- tax rates would apply. Losses would be easier to deduct, however. As with stocks, Bitcoin dealers will be subject to different rules that wouldn\u2019t allow for capital gains treatment. Bitcoin miners will have to report their earnings as taxable income with a value equal to the worth on the day it was mined. If they mine as part of a business, they would have to pay payroll taxes as well. The IRS will require information reporting similar to how the tax agency receives notification of stock transactions and payments to independent contractors. \u201cThe danger is the creation of an electronic black market, similar to the cash economy,\u201d Joshua Blank, a tax law professor at New York University, said in a December interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what the IRS wants to avoid.\u201d The ruling takes effect immediately and covers past and future transactions and tax returns. The IRS said in the notice that it may offer relief from penalties to people who engaged in transactions before today and can show \u201creasonable cause\u201d for underpayments or failure to file. The ruling comes fewer than three months after National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said the IRS should issue guidance to taxpayers on digital currency transactions. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s responsibility to inform the public about the rules they are required to follow,\u201d Olson, who runs an independent office within IRS, wrote in her annual report to Congress in January. \u201cThe lack of clear answers to basic questions such as when and how taxpayers should report gains and losses on digital currency transactions probably encourages tax avoidance.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-25/bitcoin-is-property-not-currency-in-tax-system-irs-says', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 25, 20, 25, 6, 712000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Is Property Not Currency in Tax System, IRS Says'}, {'articleText': u'  Mt.

The price of Bitcoin was down more than 6.5 percent to $732.40 at 3:09 p.m. New York time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from exchanges including Mt. Gox. The price had fallen more than 8 percent at 8:23 a.m. SecondMarket Inc., which runs a Bitcoin investment fund for accredited investors, announced it would buy Bitcoins, partly in response to the Mt.

Barry Silbert, the New York-based company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a message on Twitter that its trading team would \u201cmake a market on a pilot basis,\u201d for orders of at least 25 Bitcoins. Silbert, whose company brokered trades of shares in closely held companies such as Facebook Inc. before they were publicly traded, said the trouble at Mt. Gox demonstrates \u201ca clear need for a U.S.-based, regulated, compliant and trustworthy Bitcoin exchange.\u201d \u201cThis could be the first step in that direction,\u201d Silbert said in an e-mail. U.S.-based exchanges have either closed at the behest of law enforcement or had difficulties obtaining business bank accounts because of regulatory uncertainty. State regulators are currently considering how to license digital currency exchanges as money transmitters. Bitcoin prices have generally traded at higher dollar prices on Mt. Gox because customers have had difficulties getting the U.S. currency out of the exchange. U.S. authorities twice seized, most recently in August, Mt. Gox bank accounts in the U.S. worth a total of $5 million after the company failed to register as a money transmitter. In the past few days, Mt. Gox customers have also encountered delays in withdrawing Bitcoins, said Greg Schvey, head of research at the Genesis Block, a New York-based digital-currency analysis firm. As a result, the premium to other exchanges has \u201ccollapsed,\u201d Schvey said in an e-mail. Mt. Gox has fallen to about 25 percent of global Bitcoin-dollar trades from about 80 percent last April, Schvey said, with other exchanges such as London-based Bitstamp picking up the volume.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox in Manhattan yesterday declined to grant bail given the \u201cpowerful evidence\u201d presented by the government. Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer had asked for $1 million bail. Ulbricht, 29, was accused by prosecutors yesterday of spending $730,000 to kill the six people in an effort to protect his business. He was officially charged by a federal grand jury in Maryland for one of the attempted murders. Prosecutors said they found no evidence that any murders took place. Allegations about two of the murder plots were disclosed in court filings last month. The first involved an undercover agent working for the U.S Attorney in Maryland, who agreed to kill a rogue Silk Road employee for $80,000, a sum that Ulbricht allegedly wired to the undercover agent\u2019s account. The second allegation involves a Silk Road user named \u201cFriendly Chemist\u201d who threatened to blackmail Ulbricht by disclosing the identities of some of Silk Road\u2019s vendors and customers, according to the filing. Ulbricht allegedly paid $150,000 to another drug vendor, \u201credandwhite,\u201d to murder Friendly Chemist. In yesterday\u2019s bail hearing, the U.S. said it retrieved e-mails showing that redandwhite told Ulbricht Friendly Chemist had implicated yet another Silk Road dealer, \u201cTony76,\u201d in the blackmail plot. Ulbricht asked redandwhite to learn more about Tony76 and was told that Tony76 lived with three other people, according to prosecutors.

Ulbricht saw himself \u201cas basically the head of an online cartel\u201d where murder is \u201cpart of the job,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner told the judge yesterday in court. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a fantasy,\u201d Turner said.

Joshua Dratel, Ulbricht\u2019s attorney, said his client doesn\u2019t have a criminal history, and he lacks the financial means or ability to flee. Friends and family members sent the court numerous letters attesting to his character, Dratel said. \u201cPeople have stolen billions of dollars and gotten bail in this courthouse,\u201d Dratel said. Throughout yesterday\u2019s hearing, which lasted about an hour, Ulbricht sat at the defense table, remaining composed even as Turner, the prosecutor, compared him to the boss of a Colombian drug cartel. Ulbricht\u2019s mother, Lyn Ulbricht, sat in a row with several relatives. After bail was denied, she let out an audible sigh. As he was escorted from the courtroom, Ulbricht turned toward her and waved. Outside the courtroom, his mother told reporters that her son \u201cis not a danger\u201d and that the case against him \u201cdoesn\u2019t add up.\u201d At the time of Ulbricht\u2019s arrest last month, the government\u2019s complaint cited circumstantial evidence indicating that the Texas native was Dread Pirate Roberts, the mastermind behind the Silk Road website who took the name after a character in the movie \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d In court yesterday, the prosecutor told the judge that when Ulbricht was arrested in a San Francisco public library on Oct. 1, the defendant had just logged on to his computer as Dread Pirate Roberts. As part of the government\u2019s letter opposing bail, prosecutors showed screengrabs taken from Ulbricht\u2019s computer, indicating that Ulbricht was the primary administrator of the site. One Web page, titled \u201cmastermind,\u201d showed an overview of the transactions and money moving through the site. The criminal case is U.S. v.

The company has sought to discuss Bitcoin regulations with officials from agencies including the People\u2019s Bank of China, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, BTC China Chief Executive Officer Bobby Lee said in a Nov. 29 interview in Shanghai. It\u2019s not yet been able to arrange any high-level meetings, he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll ask us \u2018how should you be regulated,\u2019 and I\u2019ll say \u2018Hey, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done proactively and here\u2019s how we think you should regulate us,\u2019\u201d Lee said of the Shanghai-based company\u2019s talks with regulators. Bitcoin is \u201cnot on the black list and it\u2019s not on the white list. It\u2019s in the gray area.\u201d The growth of Chinese investments in Bitcoin has come amid concerns that regulators may ban trading of the electronic currency. That was eased this month when deputy central bank governor Yi Gang was cited by the 21st Century Business Herald as saying that people were free to trade Bitcoin even as China refrains from recognizing it as a currency in the short term. \u201cThis is very different from six months ago when I was very much unsure of Chinese opinion,\u201d Lee said of Yi\u2019s comments on Bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin, which is not regulated by any country or banking authority, soared 80-fold from a year ago and traded at $1,000 apiece at 10:09 a.m. in Shanghai on BitStamp, an Internet-based exchange where Bitcoins are traded for dollars, euros and other currencies. It was quoted at 7,491.03 yuan ($1,230) on BTC China, which was set up in June 2011 as the first trading platform for the digital currency in the nation, according to its website. The closure of some Bitcoin exchanges, resulting in investor losses, has fueled concerns that authorities may ban trading of the digital currency. GBL, an online trading platform that attracted almost 1,000 Chinese investors, was shut down Oct. 26, leaving investors with losses of as much as 25 million yuan ($4.1 million), the Hong Kong Standard reported. The average life span of a Bitcoin exchange is about 380 days, with half of exchanges closing within a year of their opening, BTC China\u2019s Lee said. China will continue to monitor Bitcoin development in the long term, Yi was cited by 21st Century Business Herald as saying. Bitcoin may support China\u2019s financial reforms given the nation\u2019s desire to promote other currencies beyond the U.S. dollar for trade, Zennon Kapron, managing director of financial consultancy Kapronasia, said in a Nov. 28 interview in Shanghai. The U.S. Department of Justice said last month the digital currency can be a \u201clegal means of exchange.\u201d at a U.S. Senate committee hearing. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs arranged the hearing after the Silk Road Hidden Website, a trading platform, was shut down in October, and cut the value of Bitcoin by a third.

The\xa0securities watchdog\xa0has temporarily suspended shares of five companies that claim\xa0to be operating in the cannabis industry over questions about the accuracy of their public statements and potentially illegal sales of securities and market manipulation, according to\xa0an SEC notice published today. One of the companies suspended this morning, Denver-based FusionPharm, sells a line of cultivation containers called PharmPods, touted as a \u201cplug and grow\u201d solution for cannabis. Information that\xa0FusionPharm disclosed on its\xa0assets, revenue, financial statements, business transactions, and current financial condition may be\xa0inadequate or inaccurate, according to the SEC\u2019s suspension order, which lasts until May\xa030.

The SEC highlighted another potential issue for investors in a shaded box on its notice: the legal risk of prosecution that pot-related companies face. While 20 states and the District of Columbia have legalized some marijuana-related activity, there\u2019s the risk of federal criminal prosecution of cannabis businesses under the Controlled Substances Act, according to the notice.

In reality, the material of the SAT is a part of the foundation for lucrative ideas and business professionalism. More often than not, people severely underestimate the usefulness of the content in the SAT and the benefits of the journey to mentally and academically prepare for it. The mathematics sections enforce important topics that can lead to a multibillion dollar system. To demonstrate, consider the following problem: #18. Take three positive integers that have no common factor and where a + b = c (for instance, 5, 8, and 13). Now take the distinct prime factors of these integers\u2014in this case 2, 5, and 13\u2014and multiply them to get a new number, d. What is d in terms of c? This question is written in the familiar structure of an SAT problem, even with the dreaded \u201cin terms of\u201d phrase. It contains such key words as positive, integers, common factor, distinct, and prime numbers. Nearly all math questions on the SAT require students to memorize these fundamental vocabulary terms. The vast majority of high school students do not realize that when used in the correct situations, knowledge of math vocabulary can contribute to creating copious amounts of money. In fact, the above problem is the notorious \u201cabc conjecture,\u201d a problem that allegedly inspired the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto to create the Bitcoin system in 2009. Four years later, Bitcoin had a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Does learning SAT math vocabulary suddenly seem much more worthwhile? The grammar questions in the SAT writing sections are often criticized as obscure and useless. Before we jump on that bandwagon, let us first look at the frequently tested grammar rules: subject-verb agreement, verb tense, pronoun agreement, punctuation, and parallel construction, to name a few. Contrary to popular belief, the grammar rules on the SAT are basic and essential components of the English language. A recent study by Grammarly, an online grammar-checking program, drew correlation between correct grammar usage and monetary success on LinkedIn, a professional networking website. They found that\xa0Coke and\xa0Google made four times fewer writing mistakes than did\xa0Pepsi and Facebook, respectively. Coke and Google control a significantly bigger market share than their competitors. Brad Hoover, chief executive officer of Grammarly, postulates that there is probably highly causality at play. \u201cAccurate writing demonstrates professionalism, and customers are more likely to buy a product or a service from a company they trust.\u201d Inversely, bad grammar can cost corporations large amounts of money. For example in 2006,\xa0Rogers Communications and\xa0Bell Aliant were involved in a $2.6 million contract dispute over a single comma that had created an ambiguous clause. Reviewing grammar rules tested on the SAT would have easily prevented this disaster. Clearly, correct grammar is a necessary and treasured commodity. The subject areas covered in the SAT apply to the real world in significant ways. Moreover, the process of studying for and taking the exam is a great exercise in self-discipline and determination. Standardized tests do not end with the SAT. MCAT for medical school, LSAT for law school, GMAT for business school, GRE for graduate school, and other tests known by acronyms will require the work ethic first instilled in students when they conquer the SAT. The SAT score is not merely a four-digit number to include in your college applications. The topics tested on the SAT\u2014and the journey to get there\u2014are meaningful. They deserve a permanent place on your bookshelf of knowledgePlan on taking the SAT soon?

Regulators across the country puzzled over how to handle Bitcoin and its ilk will likely view\xa0the state\u2019s rules as a template, and so the proposal released on Thursday (PDF)\xa0might end up shaping the national landscape. As written, New York\u2019s rules would legitimize Bitcoin while taking another step toward its rational endpoint: a dull and possibly practical financial instrument devoid of counterculture cred. Licenses\u2014adorably named BitLicenses by the state\u2014would be required to be held by companies that provide financial services; businesses that just accept payments in virtual currencies won\u2019t need a license. Bitcoin transactions of more than $10,000 must be reported to state officials, and businesses would need to keep detailed records of every transaction involving the virtual currency, including the names and physical addresses of all parties involved, the amount of value changing hands, and \u201ca description of the transaction.\u201d Anonymity was one of the initial appeals of Bitcoin, but you hear less and less about this virtue the more it shifts from being a libertarian craze to a financial craze. In this sense, Bitcoin is following the traditional path of the aging radical. As a youngster it set out to smash the system, keep the government out of its business, get a little high, and so on. But over time it starts thinking more practically, decides there are advantages to being co-opted by Wall Street after all, and develops a taste for really expensive shoes. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a Che Guevara poster hanging in the basement. Benjamin Lawsky, New York\u2019s superintendent of financial services, says he wants to set up \u201ccommon sense rules of the road.\u201d But he isn\u2019t forgetting Bitcoin\u2019s roots. In addition to the standard press release, he took to Reddit to explain himself. The response was a mixture of angry suspicion and appreciation that Lawsky was so thoughtful to visit the website.

That was the message delivered by David Cohen, under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, at a speech on Tuesday morning at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. Cohen expressed concern that terrorists and people looking to avoid sanctions could make nefarious use of Bitcoin or additional virtual currencies. Considering that this comes a day after the Obama administration announced sanctions on several Russian officials, his worries seemed particularly timely. For now, however, Cohen sees this as primarily a hypothetical threat\u2014and he seemed hesitant even to describe Bitcoin as a currency: The volatility associated with virtual currency, combined with its low capitalization and liquidity, has limited its appeal to these illicit actors. Terrorists generally need \u201creal\u201d currency, not virtual currency, to pay their expenses\u2014such as salaries, bribes, weapons, travel, and safe houses. The same is true for those seeking to evade sanctions. Bitcoin has a long way to go before it becomes a dominant player in the world of illicit finance. Hundreds of billions of dollars of illicit funds flow through through the international finance system yearly, Cohen said, while the total value of all Bitcoins in circulation is about $7.5 billion. There are plenty of effective ways to move dirty money around, including hawaladars, guys with briefcases of cash handcuffed to their wrists, and, you know, real banks. As of now, the federal government regulates only the transfer between virtual currencies and conventional money. Treasury issued its initial guidance on these activities exactly a year ago and doesn\u2019t feel it needs to go further. As Cohen sees it, Bitcoin transactions are like cash transactions and don\u2019t require intervention. In fact, Bitcoin transactions are\xa0less regulated than cash transactions. Vendors processing more than $10,000 in bills have to report such transactions; there is no such requirement for virtual currencies. The only way this will change is if virtual currencies become so widespread that people can carry on their lives totally in Bitcoin. While that idea makes a fine premise for an article by a San Francisco-based journalist, it doesn\u2019t make much sense for a criminal. This doesn\u2019t mean it will never make sense. Cohen holds open the prospect of regulating Bitcoin transactions, if only to implement the kind of reporting requirements mandated for large cash transactions. Treasury follows technological innovation in the financial system, Cohen said in his remarks, and it will always choose transparency over novelty. He even sought to smooth feathers among Bitcoin enthusiasts with a gesture of inclusion: Treasury\u2019s advisory group for the Bank Secrecy Act will appoint \u201ca member of the virtual currency community,\u201d he said, to join its ranks.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-18/if-bitcoin-remains-impractical-treasury-will-let-it-be', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 18, 16, 46, 31, 804000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'If Bitcoin Remains Impractical, Treasury Will Let It Be'}, {'articleText': u' If you want to bet long on Bitcoin, what better way than to put some in your retirement account? SecondMarket, a finance startup that has helped people invest in private technology companies, has been gathering the virtual currency into the Bitcoin Investment Trust. It has been buying Bitcoin for several months and currently holds about $70 million worth. About 90 people have invested in the trust. While SecondMarket makes direct investment available only for accredited investors or financial institutions, it also has worked out arrangements with several self-directed IRA platforms, including Pensco and Entrust, so that people can use their retirement accounts to invest in Bitcoin in increments as low as $25,000. Fidelity had also been involved but \xa0says it has decided to end its participation with the SecondMarket program. The trust, started in September, is just another example of the money flowing into the Bitcoin world. On Thursday, Coinbase, a Bitcoin wallet with 600,000 users, announced it had\xa0raised $25 million\xa0from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the biggest investment in a Bitcoin startup to date. Regulators in the U.S. have been making increasingly friendly noises about the cybercurrency, and financial types are circling. \u201c2014 will be the year of Wall Street and Bitcoin,\u201d says Barry Silbert, the founder and chief executive of SecondMarket. As that happens, there will be increasing options for people to tie their own financial fortunes to Bitcoin\u2019s value. The Bitcoin Investment Trust isn\u2019t the only way to bet your retirement on the value of Bitcoin. People have already found other ways to do it. Tym Blanchard, who works at a chemical company in Charlottesville, Va., says he set up a Roth IRA to invest in Bitcoin directly, purchasing the currency through Coinbase. While he expressed some wariness that traditional investments tend to move in line with one another, he was also looking for tax benefits. \u201cIf the currency is still thriving by the the time I\u2019m allowed to make distributions, the tax savings will be enormous,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. \u201cI enjoy taking risks.\u201d What SecondMarket offers is a far easier way to do this. Buying Bitcoin is complicated and storing it is fraught with danger from hackers. Basically, this offers investors who want to ride the wave but don\u2019t really understand the nuts and bolts of the currency a way to do so. Of course, people can do all kinds of silly things with money they might actually need later in life. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already expressed a general concern\xa0about the fact that approximately 2 percent of IRAs are held in self-directed accounts, totaling $94 billion.\xa0\u201dThe large amount of money held in self-directed IRAs makes them attractive targets for fraud promoters,\u201d the agency wrote in an alert to investors in 2011. This August, the SEC brought charges against a man who persuaded people to invest their IRAs in his Ponzi scheme, then used the money to invest in a reality show about bounty hunters. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have to be a fraud for people to lose their shirts. It would have the same effect if it was just a farce, as some people think it is. The only sure way that Bitcoin will stabilize is if becomes a widely adopted global currency. That day, if it ever comes, is a while off. Even Silbert says that people shouldn\u2019t be investing money in Bitcoin that they can\u2019t afford to lose. While he\u2019s bullish on its long-term future, he expects volatility to increase over the next year and acknowledges that the value could well hit zero eventually. \u201cI think Bitcoin is an incredibly risky investment,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re either going to lose all your money or you\u2019re going to see meaningful, meaningful returns.

So what can you get by putting one to use for your company, as Lockheed Martin has since it bought the world\u2019s first corporate model from D-Wave Systems in 2011? (A few weeks ago, Google (GOOG) bought the second.) The aerospace and security giant has been operating its device at the University of Southern California\u2019s\xa0Quantum Computation Center for the past 18 months.  Bloomberg Businessweek spoke with Brad Pietras, Lockheed\u2019s vice president in charge of technology, about quantum computing\u2019s value to his business and its future. \nFor those unfamiliar with quantum computing, can you explain how this machine differs from a conventional computer?\n Quantum computing uses the quantum nature of matter, the atoms themselves, as computing devices. Normal computer architecture is based on the bit\u2014represented either as a one or a zero. The quantum computer is programmed so that the input is initially both zero and one. \nWhy is that a big deal?\n Because on the quantum level you\u2019re able to program the atoms to represent all possible input combinations, and to do so simultaneously. That means when you run an algorithm, all possible input combinations are tested at once. With a regular computer you\u2019d have to serially cycle through every possible input combination to arrive at your solution, meaning it would take longer than the age of the universe to complete the most complicated calculations. \nWhat is Lockheed Martin\u2019s interest with quantum computing?\n To solve hugely enormous, complex problems in a reasonable amount of time. That has been intriguing to our scientists at Lockheed Martin since the first inception of quantum computing. \nWhat tasks has your quantum computer already solved?\n We\u2019ve started with smaller tasks at first to better understand the capabilities of the machine. But one area of interest is in complex systems such as software verification and validation. The development of any large computer system integration initiative involves a lot of software. Validating the performance of that software is vital, but it\u2019s a very time-consuming and often very expensive undertaking. We\u2019ve taken the software and cast it as a problem for the quantum computer to address. It scans through the switches and combinations in the software code and makes sure that it\u2019s performing in a way that we expected it to. \nYou haven\u2019t used it to calculate pi or mint Bitcoins, then?\n No, but I do see the quantum computer as a machine that frees up time and money. If you can validate and verify software in a single series of tests, then the money and time saved can be used elsewhere. It becomes an innovation enabler. \nThere are skeptics who say that true quantum computing is still a generation away. Are you sure you spent millions on the real deal?\n I think we are already in the era of quantum computing. For me the academic question of how quantum it is, and how entangled the \u201cqubits\u201d (quantum bits) are, really doesn\u2019t concern me. What I am concerned with is how it can help me reduce costs, make better systems, and accelerate innovation. \nWould you say the quantum computer has practical business implications beyond testing software?\n Yes. Quantum computing is a practical tool for extremely complex predictive analysis, and machine learning where you need to assess many variables and many patterns and test models against it. This is relevant in the area of drug discovery, cybersecurity, business, finance, investment, health care, logistics, and planning. There are a number of business applications\u2014those that involve solving complex optimization problems\u2014that today would be too difficult to address with silicon computing. \nShould we ditch our PCs and smartphones, then?\n Conventional computing is not going to go away. You wouldn\u2019t want to use a quantum computer to balance your checkbook. Quantum computing best addresses those exceedingly complex computational problems\u2014in drug discovery, for example, when you have trillions of combinations of amino acids to cycle through to find that single protein. That\u2019s a job for quantum computing. That\u2019s the power of it, in a nutshell.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': u'Bernhard Warner', 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-30/what-quantum-computing-can-do-for-you', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 5, 30, 16, 26, 37, 203000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'What Quantum Computing Can Do for You'}, {'articleText': u' Mt. Gox, the best-known Bitcoin exchange, is making an effort to go respectable. On Thursday the Tokyo-based exchange announced the introduction of user verification for currency deposits and withdrawals\u2014that excludes deposits and withdrawals of Bitcoin itself, but it does mean those spending dollars or euros or whatever to buy Bitcoin or sell it may now be logged. Is this a bad thing? Some Bitcoin fans would argue it is\u2014much of the attraction of the crypto-currency is its anonymity of use. That hasn\u2019t disappeared in the case of Mt. Gox (the nature of the Bitcoin system precludes such a possibility, anyway), but the anonymity of ownership has now been diminished for many, if not most, users buying into the system or cashing out from this point on. For those planning to build a legitimate, profitable ecosystem around Bitcoin, this is a completely necessary development. Look at it from Mt. Gox\u2019s perspective. This last week saw the Liberty Reserve shut down because it was a money-laundering hub. Of course, that operation was allegedly set up for that very purpose and was definitely used as such by criminals, while nobody has leveled such accusations at Mt. Gox (as far as I\u2019m aware), but it would certainly have given the Mt. Gox proprietors pause for thought. And then there was Homeland Security\u2019s seizure of some Mt. Gox funds earlier this month. This wasn\u2019t an anti-Bitcoin move, as it had to do with Mt. Gox owner Mark Karpeles\u2019s alleged misrepresentation when opening a bank account (he apparently promised he wasn\u2019t going to engage in a currency business), but again the reasonable reaction would be to stress how legit the operation is trying to be. As the U.S. financial crimes authority Fincen has recently clarified, it\u2019s the exchanges that need regulation, not digital currencies themselves. That stands to reason: Bitcoin transactions simply can\u2019t be monitored due to the inherent anonymity in the system, but the exchanges are businesses that will benefit from not getting raided\u2014it\u2019s ultimately in their interests to play by the rules. Bitcoin enthusiasts may view these developments with suspicion\u2014many approach Bitcoin with a libertarian zeal that involves massive mistrust of official currency control\u2014but really, they should welcome it. Anyone who thought Bitcoin\u2019s use could remain entirely free of regulation either was kidding themselves or would rather have seen the currency stay small and out of the limelight. In any case, as security expert Brian Krebs points out, money launderers and other criminals looking for a stealthy transaction system have plenty of other digital currencies to use\u2014ones that aren\u2019t trying to go legit and also don\u2019t fluctuate wildly in value. Here\u2019s a salient quote from a \u201cmember of an exclusive crime forum\u201d that Krebs says he saw: \u201cSay I pay you $1k today for a project, and it\u2019s late, and you decide to withdraw tomorrow. You wake up and the $1k I just sent you in Bitcoins is now worth just $600. It\u2019s not yet stable to be used in such a way.\u201d If I were a criminal looking to use a virtual currency, I think I\u2019d opt for one that might not lead to my legs getting broken. People will always be able to do dodgy things with Bitcoin, much as they can always do dodgy things with fiat currency. But if the Bitcoin ecosystem is to grow, it will need to play by at least some of the rules that apply to dollars and euros. That\u2019s nothing to fear, and if anyone in the community thinks it is, perhaps they should apply their minds to creating an innovative self-regulatory system around the currency. Sometimes it\u2019s useful to pull back a little, and this is one of those cases. Bitcoin and its exchanges should be viewed in the wider context of interesting new financial service operations that can take the friction and unnecessary cost out of payments, particularly international money transfers. It\u2019s still possible to stick it to the man (well, the banks at least) without inviting criminal use. Disruptive potential can coexist with legitimacy.

Check out this post from Errata Security\u2019s Robert Graham, who notes that the Bitcoin block chain mechanism\u2014usually used to negate the possibility of double-spending\u2014could also be employed as a public ledger for other information.

Microsoft Points will join Facebook Credits in the dustbin of virtual currencies; the social-networking giant recently announced the end of an ambitious effort once seen as having a chance to be bigger than PayPal. Not everyone is killing off their currencies: Last month Amazon launched Coins, a way for people to buy apps, e-books, and other digital goods in its online store. So why are consumer tech companies trying so hard\u2014and often failing\u2014when it comes to minting their own cash? It\u2019s important to understand that Points, Credits, and Coins are much more like airline-loyalty systems than\xa0Bitcoin or Ripple, which have aspirations of becoming new global currencies. The idea is to drive users to spend more by making transactions easy and abstract. Routing small transactions away from credit cards also avoids a steady stream of fees, and companies that do a portion of their business in play money have more flexibility for creative accounting. Microsoft showed what can go wrong. The company irritated customers by forcing them to buy Points in chunks that didn\u2019t correspond to common purchase prices, guaranteeing that most users would have Points left over on their account. Many people felt its exchange rate of 80 points per dollar was intentionally deceptive because it made purchases appear cheaper than they were. Microsoft also didn\u2019t adjust the value of Points to changes in their value of international currencies over time, so they became more expensive in different countries as real-world currencies fluctuated. The company eventually gave in to complaints. \u201cThe ability to buy and rent content using local currency is something that the Xbox Live community has told us they want,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement. Facebook said the initial inspiration for Credits was to try to simplify a situation in which many developers building games on its platform were setting up their own currencies. \u201cPreviously, developers were building all of their own currencies and it was a confusing user experience to have a virtual currency to buy a virtual currency. Credits simplified this,\u201d wrote Tera Randall, a Facebook spokeswoman, in an e-mail. Except that it didn\u2019t get any simpler. Developers kept using their own currencies, muddling things for customers, even as Facebook had to deal with the hassles of keeping up with foreign currency exchanges. One of the key appeals of airline loyalty points has been lock-in: You\u2019ll fly with, say, Delta\u2014even if you grow frustrated with the airline\u2014because of all those travel miles you\u2019ve racked up. But technology companies could get that benefit only if people like using virtual currencies, argues Dennis Armbruster, a managing partner at Loyalty One Consulting, which advises large companies on loyalty programs.\xa0\u201dIt\u2019s really about the data,\u201d he says.  \u201cThe currency itself won\u2019t drive lock-in, although it might encourage the kind of engagement that could lead to lock-in.\u201d\xa0In addition, says Armbruster, technology companies are reevaluating the value of virtual currencies because of tax and regulatory issues, being driven in part by the government\u2019s increasing interest in the disruptive potential of projects such as Bitcoin. Amazon, however, still thinks it can make this work. The company is seeding customers accounts with Coins, essentially footing the bill for them to spend money on products the company sells. If customers don\u2019t find the process as annoying as they did on Facebook and Xbox, they could well appreciate the free money. Amazon is also offering discounts to those who buy Coins in bulk, encouraging them to build up reserves that can be used only in Amazon\u2019s store. \u201cIf we\u2019ve learned anything from Amazon, it\u2019s that they can innovate with the best of them and that they can build incredible user loyalty and adoption,\u201d said Chris Larsen, the founder of Ripple. \u201cSo there is certainly a path to success here.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-11/no-fun-money-enough-already-with-tech-companies-currencies', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 6, 11, 16, 4, 11, 757000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"No-Fun Money: Enough Already With Tech Companies' Currencies"}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-10-29/sec-to-fix-edgar-filing-system-exchairman-levitt-says-video', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-11-18/why-tim-draper-is-betting-big-on-bitcoin', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' The people who dislike cybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs aren\u2019t subtle. In early January, Krebs got a bag of poop in the mail. That was better than the time last summer when he received 13 packets of heroin. Both were way, way better than the day last March when a SWAT team descended on his doorstep, lured by a fake report of a hostage situation. \u201cHaving multiple automatic weapons pointed at your head is not my idea of a great time,\u201d Krebs deadpans. \u201cThe kind of work I do, I paint a big target on my head.\u201d Krebs\u2019s talent for exposing the weaknesses in online security has earned him respect in the IT business and loathing among cybercriminals. His track record of scoops, including the Dec. 18 revelation that hackers stole tens of millions of customers\u2019 financial data from Target, has helped him become the rare blogger who supports himself on the strength of his reputation for hard-nosed reporting. (Target didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.) Krebs often posts step-by-step details\u2014without outing his sources\u2014of how he\u2019s uncovered which hackers breached whose corporate defenses. \u201cThat\u2019s something people really want,\u201d says Andy Ellis, chief security officer at Akamai Technologies. \u201cEverything he writes is some of our best open-source intelligence.\u201d Krebs, 41, started covering cybersecurity as a reporter for the Washington Post, where he\u2019d worked his way up from the circulation department after college. In 2005 he launched the Post\u2019s Security Fix blog and began to infiltrate the online forums and chat rooms where criminals often operate. \u201cSome of these communities, you don\u2019t just say, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s up, guys?\u2019\u200a\u201d Krebs says. He learned hacker slang, listened to hundreds of hours of Russian language lessons, and persuaded industry sources to share their tricks. In 2009, when the Post merged its online and print newsrooms, Krebs lost his job. After the initial shock wore off, he started his own blog, krebsonsecurity.com. \u201cI really wanted to continue doing what I was doing and didn\u2019t see any reason to stop,\u201d he says. He was the first to report on the existence of the Stuxnet virus, broke the news of a hack at Adobe Systems, and uncovered how the credit bureau Experian was tricked into selling consumer data to identity thieves. In a statement on Adobe\u2019s website, the company\u2019s chief security officer, Brad Arkin, thanked Krebs for his help. On a typical day, Krebs runs on his treadmill, downs a smoothie, then by 9 a.m. heads to what he half-jokingly calls his command center, the U-shaped desk that fills most of a guest bedroom. On his desk sits a laptop and four monitors. One streams images from home security cameras, which he upgraded after the SWAT incident. A 12-gauge shotgun, another recent addition, leans in the corner. \u201cNo intelligence agency could get as much as Brian Krebs does,\u201d says Lance James, the head of intelligence at Deloitte. \u201cEverybody wants to share with him.\u201d When two Russian spammers who processed payments for fraudulent online pharmacies hacked each other, each sent the other\u2019s accounting files to Krebs. (He\u2019s turning that story into a book due out later this year from Sourcebooks.) Hackers also plant Krebs\u2019s name in code on their malware. One hosted a malware network at f**kbriankrebs.com. In mid-December, Krebs started to hear talk of a big data breach. A source at a large bank pointed him to websites selling stolen information from credit cards it had issued, all of which had been recently used at Target. He corroborated the tip and broke news of the attack, then identified a Ukrainian man he\u2019d determined was selling the stolen data. In an online chat that Krebs later posted, the man offered him $10,000 to back off. Krebs declined and ran the story. Although he misses the perks of tech support, the blogger says he now makes more money than he did at the Post. Security businesses such as Authentify and IBM\u2019s Trusteer division advertise on his site, which attracted about 800,000 unique visitors in December. Since he broke the Target story, about 100 readers have donated anywhere from a few dollars to several hundred via PayPal or Bitcoin. Krebs also gives a dozen paid speeches per year and takes the occasional data-mining project, usually for financial companies, though he wouldn\u2019t say for which or how much.  One recent afternoon, Krebs said that even though stories about the National Security Agency have dominated coverage lately, he wants to stay focused on fraud. Midsentence, his computer jingled with an incoming call. \u201cI\u2019ve got to take this,\u201d he said, throwing on a set of headphones. \u201cOh, that is a higher-end clientele,\u201d he told the caller as he typed.

The week before, Charlie Shrem, co-founder and chief executive officer of BitInstant, was arrested in New York getting off a plane from Amsterdam. Shrem was charged by federal prosecutors with conspiracy to commit money laundering linked to alleged sales of more than $1 million in Bitcoins to people who wanted to buy drugs on Silk Road, a now defunct online marketplace. The arrests underlined growing concerns among U.S. law enforcement officials that Bitcoin has become the preferred currency of the criminal underworld and that currency exchanges such as Shrem\u2019s have become the enablers of drug trafficking and other nefarious enterprises. But you know who else has a history of enabling nefarious criminal enterprises? Banks. HSBC in December 2012 agreed to a $1.9 billion settlement with the U.S. government over charges it failed to monitor $670 billion in wire transfers and $9.4 billion in purchases of U.S. currency. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Mexican cartels deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars a day at HSBC M\xe9xico branches, placing the cash in boxes specially designed to fit the dimensions of the teller windows. Wachovia, now part of Wells Fargo, also admitted its failure to report suspected cartel money going through the bank as part of a $160 million settlement it reached in 2010. ING and Standard Chartered, among others, have settled similar cases. The banks got deferred prosecution agreements. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, in announcing the HSBC settlement, argued that a criminal indictment would have posed too great a risk to the financial system and potentially cost thousands of jobs. In other words, HSBC was too big to prosecute. No bank employees were charged. Shrem, on the other hand, faces a potential prison sentence of 30 years in a case in which the amounts are a rounding error next to those HSBC and Wachovia handled. \u201cI think there\u2019s a double standard of justice that\u2019s being administered by the [Eric] Holder Department of Justice,\u201d says Jimmy Gurul\xe9, a former federal prosecutor and Treasury Department enforcement official who is now a professor at Notre Dame Law School. \u201cOne standard for large global banks and their officials, and another standard for everyone else.\u201d Shrem\u2019s attorney, Marc Agnifilo, says his client \u201cdenies that he laundered money and we anticipate that we\u2019ll contest these charges in court.\u201d Reid has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Ronald Lowy, accuses the state government of scapegoating his client \u201cin an effort to make media waves to discourage the use and transfer of Bitcoins.\u201d Espinoza\u2019s lawyer could not be reached. Some Bitcoin proponents have seized on this disparity to make an argument against money-laundering laws. Libertarians see the statutes as one more way the government, under the guise of protecting us from criminals, exerts control over our lives. A piece last May in American Banker by e-money researcher Jon Matonis was titled \u201cMoney Laundering Is Financial Thoughtcrime.\u201d Seen one way, the decision to prosecute Bitcoin entrepreneurs is evidence that the government is at least taking the currency seriously.

The trouble is, crunching those numbers takes a tremendous amount of energy. Fred Trotter, a co-founder of data journal and software company Not Only Dev, estimates that in the five years Bitcoins have existed, machines dedicated to mining them have consumed 150,000 megawatt-hours of electricity\u2014enough to keep the Eiffel Tower lit for more than two and a half centuries.  Years the Eiffel Tower could stay lit with the energy used to mine Bitcoins since \u201909  To ensure they can turn a profit, Bitcoin miners are scouring the globe for the cheapest power, from sleepy rural towns in America\u2019s Pacific Northwest to the shadows of volcanoes in Iceland, where a few enthusiasts have built one of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining collectives using low-cost geothermal energy. When power costs are high, it becomes a lot tougher to justify mining Bitcoins, says Alex Wilhelm, a miner and software engineer living in Tokyo. \u201cIf the electricity price goes up, the math stops working,\u201d he says. Wilhelm doesn\u2019t keep his modest 30-server mining operation, which he estimates will earn $12,500 this year, in Japan. Instead it\u2019s sitting halfway around the world in the tiny Austrian village of Tattendorf, where Wilhelm grew up. He gets electricity there free from his father\u2019s power plant, a water-driven turbine housed in a two-century-old brick building that has been in the family for at least six generations and once powered the entire village. From Tokyo, Wilhelm manages his Austrian server farm over the Internet, with video cameras that give him a look at the rows of circuit boards hanging like bats from metal racks inside the cavernous stone room where he used to play. In his Tokyo apartment, Wilhelm pulls up the Bitcoin calculator on the website CoinWarz to show why his server farm isn\u2019t located at home. The setup burns 10 kilowatts, and electricity in Tokyo costs about 25\xa2 per kilowatt-hour, among the most expensive rates in the world. He estimates that he\u2019d lose about $13 per day on Bitcoin mining there, after the $70 in daily power charges. It\u2019s also nice not to have to deal with the noise: The fans that cool his Bitcoin servers run so loudly that when he switches on his audio feed, the noise from the speakers is a little like standing under a waterfall. \u201cYou can imagine if you have something like this at home, your wife won\u2019t be very happy,\u201d Wilhelm says. \u201cIt\u2019s just loud, and it\u2019s hot, and it\u2019s expensive.\u201d   Not everyone has a power plant in the family. Robert Van Kirk, who co-founded a company called MyRigSpace.com that hosts other people\u2019s mining gear in an old Portland (Ore.) server farm, is comparison shopping. He and partner Damir Kalinkin aren\u2019t satisfied with paying 5 cents per kilowatt-hour there, even though it\u2019s about half the U.S. average. Van Kirk says they\u2019re planning to move to Moses Lake, Wash., a quiet town with more cows than people and the second-lowest electricity rates in the U.S., after Minot, N.D. Each kilowatt-hour there costs 1.7\xa2, making Moses Lake a destination for Bitcoin miners. \u201cI called a real estate agent, and I told them we need a location with a lot of electricity,\u201d Van Kirk says. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Oh, are you guys involved in Bitcoin?\u2019\u2009\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s biggest problem lately has been stability. The February disappearance of more than $500 million worth of Bitcoins from Tokyo-based Mount Gox, one of the biggest exchanges, has given the virtual currency a black eye. But power consumption has always been a primary issue, says cryptographer Philipp G\xfchring, who co-authored a 2011 paper on energy\u2019s role in virtual mining. \u201cYes, you need the hardware, and you need the software, but electricity is the core thing that drives Bitcoin,\u201d he says. Even some of the technology\u2019s supporters say the focus on bigger, better, power-hungrier mining equipment has become a wasteful arms race. \u201cThe network would operate just fine with only 1 percent of the current computing muscle devoted to it,\u201d Trotter says. \u201cIt\u2019s consuming resources that should be allocated differently.\u201d Wilhelm is betting his low-cost mining will pay off. He says he and his father worry they\u2019ll have to close the Tattendorf power plant when energy subsidies run out in 2016. They may be able to keep it open, he says, with a successful Bitcoin operation\u2014if the virtual currency repeats its performance from last year, when it shot from $13 apiece to around $1,100. (As of April 23, the price was hovering around $487.) \u201cIt all depends on the value of Bitcoin,\u201d Wilhelm says. \u201cIf you\u2019re mining at this stage\u2009\u2026\u2009you\u2019re doing it because you believe it will go up.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/pashakun', 'name': u'Jason Clenfield', 'twitterhandle': u'pashakun'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-24/bitcoin-miners-seek-cheap-electricity-to-eke-out-a-profit', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 4, 25, 3, 31, 54, 978000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'The Other Bitcoin Power Struggle'}, {'articleText': u'   You\u2019ve been thinking about changes in the workplace\u2014in fact, you\u2019ve got a new book out on the subject called The Alliance. What\u2019s different?Most people haven\u2019t looked square in the face the notion that lifetime employment is gone. That\u2019s not the way the world works anymore. But implicitly underlying HR programs, underlying recruiting, is still this presumption of a lifetime employment program, and that leads to a dishonest conversation. Both the employee and the company know there\u2019s a real chance the employee is going to go work somewhere else, and that omission leads to distrust. Our head of engineering and operations at LinkedIn actually does something that didn\u2019t occur to me but now I\u2019ve started to do. In his very first interview with an employee coming to LinkedIn, he asks them what job they want after LinkedIn. American entrepreneurship is alive and well, but can it be strengthened?I\u2019ve been thinking about getting more involved in the civic dimensions of entrepreneurship, because what happens\u2014with big companies or government\u2014is that they tend to harden the system against challengers. The incumbents tend to make it more difficult for challengers to come in. And yet the nature of entrepreneurship is the people who challenge the system, the people who say, \u201cI\u2019ve got a new product, a new service, a new idea.\u201d So where has that thinking led you?Not surprisingly, to you and other folks who know me, to the magic of the Silicon Valley network, right? You need a network by which you can quickly find other people who go, \u201cI know an expert in this. I know a customer for this. I know employees. I know financing.\u201d A startup has a set of resources that all need to be there in order to make it successful. The speed at which you can assemble that is the strength of the network. How can we, as a society, strengthen networks in various areas? Is there something we can do in Detroit? Is there something we can do in New Orleans to create a much more robust network, to enable entrepreneurship, to create economic prosperity and jobs? Is social media experiencing growing pains? And how much growth still lies ahead, with Facebook now past a billion users?They have 1.3\xa0billion, I think. So there\u2019s a bunch of technological changes. For example, a lot of the globe is still coming onto the Internet with the expansion of smartphones all over the world. That gives you a natural rising tide for all of [the social media networks]. I think there are growing pains, but I think that a lot more of the world is still coming online than is already there. So there\u2019s a massive amount of growth possible. What kind of progress is there at LinkedIn? Are people making good use of the service in your opinion?If you ask most people, \u201cDo you understand what it is to live and work in a networked world?\u201d they\u2019ll say, \u201cSure, I have a cell phone.\u201d Actually, in a networked world, there are millions of people who are searching, and what are you doing to be found? Being found on social media is the point?People say, \u201cI\u2019m overloaded. I don\u2019t want new connections.\u201d Well, you want new signal, not new noise. So you have to have the right filtering mechanism. But being found is critical. For example, my LinkedIn profile is primarily targeted at people who want to come to work at LinkedIn and people who want investment. And that\u2019s how I did the Airbnb investment. They came and found me. They knew we would be receptive. Obviously crazy people can find you, too.

Farkash was elated by the news. Raised in Egypt by Libyan parents, he was eager to participate in rebuilding his country, which he had never seen. \u201cI really had no reason whatsoever to leave London and my high-status job,\u201d he recalls recently over dinner at a restaurant in Cairo. \u201cMy life was wonderful.\u201d In the weeks that followed Qaddafi\u2019s death, Farkash was seized by a vision of how rebuilding the country might also be a pathway to personal riches. The more he studied Libya, the more convinced he became that it was a gold mine\u2014a strip of coastal desert in North Africa, next to Egypt, with a relatively well-educated population of 6 million in need of seemingly every kind of consumer product and service, for which the country would easily be able to pay by continuing to pump its usual 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels of oil per day. The Central Bank of Libya, according to Reuters, had more than $100 billion in foreign reserves, mostly money collected from oil sales under Qaddafi. The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), the overseas investment arm of the Qaddafi government, had about $70 billion invested with blue-chip Western companies such as Soci\xe9t\xe9 G\xe9n\xe9rale and Goldman Sachs, and an additional $50 billion or more invested throughout Africa. And in Libya, every asset you could imagine was dirt-cheap. \u201cIt was a clean page,\u201d he remembers. \u201cYou could start from scratch.\u201d Farkash returned to Libya that very month, along with two friends from London. Together, they started a Libyan investment bank with offices in Tripoli and Benghazi, with the aim of encouraging direct foreign investment in Libya. \u201cYou could smell that there were deals everywhere. Attractive deals,\u201d he recalls. \u201cDeals about to be done, and deals waiting to be done.\u201d Land was inexpensive and increasing by the day in value, he says. You could fill your gas tank for $5. His first inkling that something was rotten came several months after he arrived when the National Transitional Council, then Libya\u2019s chief governing body, decided to give every family a cash payout of $2,400 from the national treasury. That implied an outlay of billions. \u201cI thought that money would have been better spent collecting all the weapons in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, \u2018We\u2019re not going in the right direction.\u2019\u2009\u201d As months passed, the system of cash giveaways by the central government became institutionalized, with payments\u2014easily exceeding $20 billion in total\u2014being distributed to the general populace of Libya but also additionally to anyone who claimed to have fought or been injured in the revolution. While many of the so-called revolutionaries had only a distant connection to overthrowing Qaddafi, they formed the core of the militias, which set themselves up as permanent fixtures in Libya\u2019s cities in place of the army and the police, whose members had been sent home or jailed for collaboration with Qaddafi, regardless of whether they had actually done anything wrong. \u201cAnyone could stop you on the street and ask you for identification,\u201d Farkash says. Out of fear, he usually complied. The militias began fighting each other for territory and for the cash payouts from a central state authority that was effectively held hostage as billions of dollars per month were drained from its treasury. \n  In June 2012, Farkash learned that people were being tortured in underground prisons in Benghazi. What made the discovery particularly upsetting was that the largest of these torture chambers was located in the 17th of February revolutionary camp, right down the street from the apartment where he was living. Farkash had always thought of the 17th of February crew as the good guys. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep that night,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first thing that ran through my mind was, \u2018If that\u2019s happening now, what difference does it make that there was also injustice in the time of Qaddafi?\u2019\u2009\u201d The person who had told him about the torture chambers was a member of the Libyan state security apparatus, and Farkash was afraid to act. \u201cI realized it was too dangerous to say anything,\u201d Farkash says, still looking horrified. \u201cThis was not why I came back over. I don\u2019t want to be part of a new nation that is being built on torture and injustice.\u201d Farkash left Libya two days later\u2014then changed his mind and went back. He decided to close up shop in Benghazi, where his family is from, and join his partners in Tripoli. The capital city felt safer because of the presence of foreign embassies, which employed their own security forces. He shared an apartment with a friend who worked as a reporter for the New York Times and CNN. Night after night after work he watched footage of the street battles fought by militias who had little training in warfare, but all the equipment of a modern army. In the homes of friends and business associates, he saw heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, and shoulder-held antitank missiles. He left soon after, for good. \u201cThese are rockets used in war,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have them stored in their houses. So if these people get pissed, what will they do with it?\u201d In the last few months, the Libyans have been finding out. Warring militias have destroyed large sections of Tripoli\u2019s international airport with mortars, shoulder-launched missiles, rockets, and tanks. The fighting made the news again in July when a rocket or shell set a large oil depot on fire, sending clouds of choking black smoke over Tripoli. Shortly thereafter, 27,000 Libyans fled the fighting on foot in a single day, arriving as refugees in neighboring African countries. In just one week in July, according to a brief issued by the Soufan Group, a consultancy specializing in the Middle East, more than 60 people were killed in Benghazi, and the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, and Canada have evacuated their diplomatic personnel. Libyan oil production has declined to about 300,000 barrels a day, and a half-dozen prominent figures on the Libyan political scene, whose names had appeared in optimistic Western newspaper articles about the brave Libyans who opposed Qaddafi and fought for a more equal and democratic future, have been murdered. Their deaths have passed without any demonstrations or other significant forms of public notice inside Libya, a measure of how irrelevant the causes for which Libyans fought three years ago have become. Libya\u2019s economic future, once touted as the brightest in Africa, looks equally bleak. Western news sources around the time of Qaddafi\u2019s death reported that the dictator had stashed tens of billions of dollars away in overseas accounts that the country desperately needed to pay its bills. After the dictator was toppled, the search began for his hidden personal fortune\u2014an El Dorado of imagined gold that was built in part on the confusion between Qaddafi\u2019s personal assets and state-controlled assets such as the LIA. This fortune was estimated in various publications to be from $70 billion to $100 billion and quickly gave rise to a cottage industry in which fortune hunters struck deals with representatives of Libya\u2019s National Transitional Council to locate missing assets in return for 10 percent of the take. \n\n Not all these efforts were in vain. In London, a \xa310 million ($17 million) townhouse belonging to Qaddafi\u2019s son Saadi was shown to have been purchased with diverted Libyan state funds through a company called Capitana Seas and deemed to be the property of the Libyan state. A chunk of a London real estate agency, Chesterton Humberts, was shown to have been purchased in 2011 by the family of Ali Dabaiba, a longtime member of the dictator\u2019s inner circle. Perhaps the biggest finds were two bank accounts containing almost \u20ac100 million ($134 million) belonging to Qaddafi\u2019s son Mutassim, who was killed during the uprising. The accounts were located in Malta, a common offshore home for hidden bank accounts and shell companies. So far the Libyan government has failed to get Malta to release the funds, and the transcripts of the trials are a hilarious primer in the art of not asking inconvenient questions when large amounts of money are wired from strange locations to accounts held by the son of a notorious dictator. When the accounts were discovered, the person nominally in charge of Libya\u2019s stolen asset recovery program was Abdalla Kablan, a 27-year-old mathematician whose experience in international finance was with a company called Exante. Based in Malta, it is a broker for, among other currencies, Bitcoin, the virtual currency favored by drug dealers and money launderers. Kablan also happened to be a Maltese citizen, which made him either a very clever or a highly unlikely choice to represent Libya in adversarial proceedings with that country: His appointment was apparently helped by his being the son-in-law of Libya\u2019s current minister of foreign affairs, Mohammed Abdelaziz. While the amounts involved in these cases are large by normal standards, they barely add up to $1 billion\u2014pocket change for the oil-rich dictator and his petro state. \u201cA lot of the smokescreens you are seeing are masking the biggest robbery in the history of humanity,\u201d says Libyan-born Hafed al-Ghwell, a member of the World Bank\u2019s Development Research Group. (Al-Ghwell adds that he doesn\u2019t speak on behalf of the World Bank.) He is talking about the disbursal of state assets under the new country\u2019s leadership, if it could be called that. \u201cI can tell you financially that, in terms of foreign reserves, Libya had close to $125 billion to $130 billion until the end of last year. These numbers are verifiable.\u201d In addition to the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves, the economist estimates that the LIA has from $55 billion to $60 billion in various portfolios. \u201cThey do not know what assets they have,\u201d he says. Tens of billions of dollars, he adds, were invested in hotels, telecommunications companies, and other assets in Africa that may not be traceable. Still, a close reading of the LIA ledgers, which were leaked to a nongovernmental organization and are now available online, reveals that if tales of Qaddafi\u2019s hidden fortune proved to be a myth, the rumors that tens of billions of dollars were looted from Libyan accounts are entirely real. And it didn\u2019t begin with the collapse of the country.\xa0\xa0Late one Sunday afternoon in March 2003, three officers of the Secret Intelligence Service, Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence service (commonly known as MI6), arrived at a hotel in London\u2019s Mayfair district for a meeting with Seif al-Islam Qaddafi, another of the dictator\u2019s sons. Educated in the West and promoted as a moderate reformer, Seif was a familiar face in London, where he had helped broker a deal that lifted Western sanctions in exchange for Libya turning over two men suspected of facilitating the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Now, on the eve of the American invasion of Iraq, Seif offered the British spies a new deal: In exchange for taking steps to further open to the West, his father would be willing to come clean about Libya\u2019s weapons of mass destruction\u2014which, unlike Saddam Hussein\u2019s programs in Iraq, turned out to be far more advanced than the West imagined. In addition to secret WMD facilities hidden in the Sahara, Qaddafi had something else of interest: billions of dollars in oil wealth that the regime was desperate to invest in banks, stocks, hedge funds, property markets, infrastructure projects, advanced fighter planes, and almost anything else that Western governments and corporations had to offer. The resulting gold rush was so wildly lucrative, and obscenely unprincipled, that it continues to reverberate at the highest levels of global finance and politics a decade later. After British Prime Minister Tony Blair left office in 2007, he joined JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment banking unit in London and became a frequent visitor to Libya. According to documents made available by the muckraking nonprofit Global Witness, Blair, accompanied by British police, would fly into Tripoli on a Bombardier Challenger 300 jet hired by the elder Qaddafi, where he\u2019d be transported from the airport to the British Embassy and treated like a visiting head of state. He\u2019d stay at the British ambassador\u2019s residence and meet regularly with Seif, who oversaw the activities of the $70 billion LIA, as well as with Seif\u2019s close friend, Mustafa Zarti, the deputy head of the LIA. While Blair has said that his trips to Tripoli didn\u2019t involve doing deals with the LIA, the careful wording of his denials doesn\u2019t contradict the assessment of a senior British diplomat quoted in a Sept. 17, 2011, article in the Sunday Telegraph who described Blair\u2019s visits as devoted to lobbying for J.P. Morgan, the investment banking unit of JPMorgan Chase. \n  Internal e-mails from J.P. Morgan obtained by Global Witness add some texture and color to the diplomat\u2019s assessment. One e-mail, sent on Dec. 28, 2008, from J.P. Morgan Vice Chairman Lord Renwick to Zarti, then vice chairman of the LIA, said: \u201cOn behalf of J.P. Morgan, we would like to invite you to London in the week beginning 12 January to finalise the terms of the mandate concerning Rusal before Mr. Blair\u2019s visit to Tripoli which is scheduled to take place on around 22 January.\u201d Rusal is an aluminum company owned by Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire who was close to Blair adviser and cabinet minister Peter Mandelson; J.P. Morgan was in the running to float Rusal\u2019s shares on the London Stock Exchange, according to the Daily Telegraph\u2019s detailed reporting. Blair made six visits to Libya, none of which is listed on his official website, which regularly publishes the details of his foreign travels. On April 7, 2009, Blair\u2019s private office wrote to the British Embassy in Tripoli outlining a visit in which he hoped to meet with Qaddafi and Zarti: Rusal would eventually take its initial public offering to Hong Kong, with the LIA buying $300 million of the company shares. J.P. Morgan and the office of Tony Blair did not respond to requests for comment. In France, a growing scandal led magistrates in April 2013 to open an investigation into the allegation that former President Nicolas Sarkozy accepted tens of millions of euros in Libyan state funds to finance his successful campaign in 2007. It became headline news on June 30, 2014, when police took Sarkozy\u2019s lawyer into custody and held him for 48 hours. Criminal charges have thus far been filed against 10 people, including Sarkozy\u2019s former campaign manager. \n Goldman Sachs charged $350 million in fees for trades that lost the Libyans 98 percent of their $1.3 billion investment  Blair\u2019s, Sarkozy\u2019s, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s efforts to profit from association with the Qaddafis may have been unseemly, but they don\u2019t appear to have violated U.S. law. Other financial institutions may have crossed a legal line: The LIA is suing Goldman Sachs and Soci\xe9t\xe9 G\xe9n\xe9rale in London, while the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating several U.S. companies, including hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management and the asset advisory firm Blackstone Group, for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Publicly traded Och-Ziff has warned shareholders that its future results may be affected by the Justice Department\u2019s probe. Goldman Sachs, Och-Ziff, Soci\xe9t\xe9 G\xe9n\xe9rale, and Blackstone declined to comment. Of the nine companies to which the LIA entrusted its $70 billion bankroll, almost all appear to have lost incredible amounts of money while charging sky-high fees. According to an audit conducted by KPMG, Soci\xe9t\xe9 G\xe9n\xe9rale managed to lose more than half of a $1.8 billion investment, while charging the Libyans tens of millions for its financial expertise. London-based investment management firm Permal Group, which received $300 million from LIA, lost 40 percent of it while earning $27 million in fees. BNP Paribas lost 23 percent: \u201cHigh fees have been directly responsible for the poor results,\u201d the auditor noted. Credit Suisse lost 29 percent of the funds that it managed. Millennium Global Investments, based in London, apparently lost all of a $100 million investment in its emerging credit fund, while a $300 million investment in Lehman Brothers vanished from the books after Lehman collapsed in 2008. Credit Suisse and Permal did not respond to a request for comment. Millennium could not be reached. But the outstanding single offender was Goldman Sachs, which charged $350 million in fees for a series of trades that lost the Libyans 98 percent of their $1.3 billion investment. The Goldman fleece, as it might be known, was masterminded by Youssef Kabbaj, an executive in charge of North Africa, and Driss Ben-Brahim, the firm\u2019s emerging-markets chief. Ben-Brahim, a good-humored trader educated in France, had made headlines in England in 2004 when Goldman awarded him a bonus of \xa330 million; in 2006, British newspapers reported he received a \xa350 million bonus. \u201cWe were in awe of Driss,\u201d a former LIA executive later told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cHe was like a rock star.\u201d According to court documents filed by the LIA in London, Kabbaj and Ben-Brahim, who are both native Arabic speakers, courted the star-struck Libyans. Kabbaj took them on a trip to Morocco, where Ben-Brahim\u2019s father was born, and offered them gifts such as after-shave lotions and chocolates. From January to June 2008, Goldman set up a $1.3 billion investment in options contracts on Citigroup, UniCredit, Banco Santander, Allianz, Electricit\xe9 de France, Eni, and a basket of currencies, based on the thesis that the assets would rise in value. They went down. By February 2010, the value of the Libyan investment was $25.1 million. Kabbaj and another Goldman employee traveled to Tripoli to explain the losses to Zarti, who cursed at and physically threatened the two men. The Goldman Sachs executives were terrified enough to request the protection of bodyguards until they could flee the country. \n  In an apparent attempt to fix its relationship with Libya\u2014which, after all, had proven to be supremely profitable\u2014Goldman Sachs then offered to pay a $50 million fee to a Dutch fund called Palladyne International Asset Management, through which the LIA had already invested $300 million. Goldman could hardly have been interested in Palladyne because of the fund\u2019s financial acumen: According to an audit conducted on behalf of the LIA, 45 percent of the funds, virtually all from Libya, invested in Palladyne were held in cash, while the rest of the investments didn\u2019t do particularly well: \u201cTo date we have paid in excess of $18m in fees, for losing us $30 million,\u201d an LIA investigator noted in a report. What made Palladyne notable was that it was owned by Ismael Abudher, whose father-in-law Shukri Ghanem was the longtime head of Libya\u2019s National Oil and a trusted member of Qaddafi\u2019s inner circle. In April 2012, shortly after Qaddafi\u2019s death, Ghanem was found floating face-down in the Danube River in Vienna. Palladyne did not immediately respond to comment. According to a detailed lawsuit filed in March in U.S. District Court in Connecticut by a trader named Dan Friedman, who was hired by Palladyne in 2011, the company \u201clacked both the management competence and the infrastructure to manage money.\u201d Friedman, who\u2019s suing the recruiter who hooked him up with the firm, alleges in the complaint that, \u201cPalladyne was the asset management company equivalent of a Potemkin village, fronting for a kickback and money-laundering scheme.\u201d The complaint offers an unusually intimate account of a corporate mirror world in which recruitment meetings, trading strategies, and the company\u2019s vaunted \u201cman-and-machine\u201d trading model were used as props to disguise good, old-fashioned theft. Palladyne\u2019s true purpose, Friedman alleges, was to serve as the investment bank version of the fake betting joint in the film The Sting, while laundering \u201cmoney defalcated from Libyan government oil revenues by the family and friends of Muammar Ghaddafi\u201d and serving as the \u201crecipient and guardian of bribes and kickbacks from companies doing business with the Ghaddafi regime (or hoping to do business with them) or the state oil company run by Abudher\u2019s father-in-law.\u201d According to reports published in the financial press, the SEC is investigating whether Goldman violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \u201cPeople were making crazy amounts of money for introductions to the Libyans,\u201d says Mohammed Rashid, an Iraqi-born Kurd based in London, who arranged the meetings between Blair and Seif. Rashid is now a financial adviser to wealthy individuals and entities from the Middle East and to Europeans and Americans who wish to do business with them. According to him and others who have direct knowledge of those transactions, paying money to fixers, matchmakers, advisers, and consultants was a common practice, and such connections were eagerly sought. One London banker says consulting fees for such transactions could range anywhere from 2 percent to 5 percent of the initial investment. None of which would have mattered as much if the performance of the investments wasn\u2019t so dismal. \n \u201cThey have no idea what they have, and what they have, they steal\u201d  And if the West relieved Libya of a decent-size share of its national wealth in the years immediately before NATO toppled the dictator, the situation today is even worse. In April 2012, Mohsen Derregia, a research fellow at the University of Nottingham Business School, was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the LIA following what he describes as \u201ctotally a freak accident\u201d\u2014an accident that left him in charge of what, at an estimated $66 billion, was still one of the most valuable investment portfolios on the planet. (That the portfolio remains somewhere near its original value is no triumph in a market that has almost tripled from its low five years ago.) Derregia\u2019s area of academic specialization was accounting, and he knew nothing about finance. On the other hand, he was honest. He was soon forced out of the job and replaced by Ali Mohamed Salem Hibri, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Libya, which took effective control of the LIA in April 2013. \u201cLibya is a monkey box,\u201d says Rashid when asked if the Libyan government is capable of managing what remains of its wealth. \u201cYou see the chairman of the National Council or whatever it\u2019s called appearing on television wearing slippers and holding a Kalashnikov. They have no idea what they have, and what they have, they steal.\u201d The game of wildly overstating the personal wealth of Middle Eastern dictators, and then stealing national assets under cover of civil conflict and social chaos, Rashid suggests, is one that Western governments and financial institutions and their co-conspirators in Arab countries play hand-in-glove. \u201cThey said Hosni Mubarak and his family were worth over $20 billion,\u201d Rashid says. \u201cThe real number turned out to be a few tens of millions. Meanwhile, when Mubarak was removed from office, the foreign currency reserves and national investments of Egypt were $54 billion. Now they are below zero. You tell me where that money went.\u201d In a way, it might be lucky for Libyans that 95 percent of the country\u2019s assets in the West\u2014including the money being managed by some of the same big-name companies who lost so much the last time around\u2014has been frozen. Abdulmagid Breish, the latest head of the LIA, recently announced plans to hire companies to manage billions of dollars of assets, which from one perspective might help the Libyans get a handle on fees\u2014or open up further opportunities for catastrophic losses. As for history, so many people have now left the LIA that it may be impossible for anyone to figure out what those assets were and where they went.\xa0\xa0Sitting in a modest hotel in Qawra, a district in Tripoli favored by visitors from the Middle East, Fatima Hamroush provides a firsthand account of watching money disappear while working for Libya\u2019s nominal government. After spending most of her adult life as a physician in Ireland, Hamroush returned to her native country after Qaddafi\u2019s fall to become health minister. The experience appears to have done little to squelch the sparkle in her eyes or the laughter with which she punctuates her stories about the armed fighters who came to her office demanding money that was intended to heal the sick. Tales of Qaddafi\u2019s secret fortune also make her laugh. \u201cThe man was the state,\u201d she says in her Arabic-accented brogue. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to hide money from himself.\u201d What makes her angry, she says, are the treasure hunters who sign contracts with Libyan officials to locate Qaddafi\u2019s assets, such as the accounts in Malta. \u201cThey are a plague,\u201d she pronounces. \u201cI hear them on TV, in the newspaper, some are getting letters signed by government ministers, or the GNC [General National Congress, Libya\u2019s Parliament], and it\u2019s all illegal. It\u2019s part of a scam.\u201d When asked to provide an example of how this scam works, Hamroush says Ireland has $2 billion in Libyan assets. She knows the exact sum, she says, because Irish officials made a point of telling her how much money they had and where it was located. She took the information to Mustafa Jalil, head of the National Transitional Council, at which point at least one group of asset hunters applied to receive 10 percent of the total, she says. \u201cSomebody in the NTC is either a complete idiot or an evil genius,\u201d she concludes. \u201cMoney is being squandered everywhere like mad.\u201d Giveaways to individuals and militias from Libyan state coffers during her time in office from November 2011 to August 2012 amounted to $20 billion, according to her own estimate. In addition, the government, to buy loyalty, pays 40 percent of the adult population a salary at a cost of about $6 billion a month. While that figure could have easily been covered by oil revenue during Qaddafi\u2019s time, the country\u2019s production is now less than a quarter of what it was. Today, the practice of loading up the budget with public salaries in order to buy public loyalty has continued\u2014but with a difference. \u201cNow there are two or three times as many salaries as before,\u201d Hamroush says, and they are being paid out of the state\u2019s foreign reserves. At the rate that they are being used, the reserves will be entirely depleted in two years. \n  As with the army and the police, many qualified civil servants and administrators are banned from doing their jobs because they held the posts under the Qaddafi regime, even though they aren\u2019t accused of any crime. So they stay home and cash checks for jobs that they hold only in name. Plenty of Libyans receive checks for more than one state job. In disbanding the army and the police, the Libyan government has had to create new jobs, which are filled by militia members, many of whom had been incarcerated under Qaddafi for political offenses and also for ordinary crimes. The result, as Hamroush describes it, is a topsy-turvy world in which the state is defenseless against bands of criminals that it funds and arms. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t follow what they say,\u201d she adds, \u201cthey threaten you or come to kill you.\u201d Running a government ministry under such conditions was a challenge, Hamroush says. \u201cI was receiving every day a huge number of people without appointments. Even if you wanted to finish your work, they would bang on the doors, screaming, shouting. It\u2019s like that from 8 in the morning until 1 a.m.\u201d When automatic weapons and grenade launchers failed to make enough of an impression, she adds, militias surrounded her ministry with heavy artillery and antiaircraft missiles to emphasize their demands for cash benefits, contracts, and control over government resources and funds. The leader of the men who surrounded her ministry with missiles, she says, is now head of Libya\u2019s war wounded committee, which distributes billions of dollars to the militias. Another militant, who held four of Hamroush\u2019s staffers hostage and forced them to sign letters related to the disposal of ministry funds, was recently appointed to a senior diplomatic post in France. \u201cThen there was a kidnap attempt,\u201d she sighs. She was saved by her driver, who knew the kidnapper, a petty criminal from his hometown.\xa0\xa0It\u2019s hard for the West to understand the full scope of the disaster that\u2019s befallen Libya. It\u2019s happened, in part, because no one in or outside Libya bothered to figure out what the country might really look like after the dictator was gone. \u201cEven after Afghanistan and Iraq, no one seems to have thought seriously about what would happen afterward,\u201d says al-Ghwell, the World Bank economist. Al-Ghwell, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on the development of North African economies, says Libya is well along the road to becoming something new: the world\u2019s first failed petro state. \u201cYou can imagine Somali rebels and pirates with money to burn,\u201d he says, when asked why the collapse of Libya should bother anyone besides the Libyans. Unlike many political leaders, Ali Zeidan, Libya\u2019s former prime minister, is willing to discuss on the record his fear of radical Islamist cells that are often referred to by Libyans as Al Qaeda. While some of those cells do have direct links to Al Qaeda, others are linked to Ansar al-Sharia and to other salafist factions that share a willingness to die for their radical Islamist ideology. Some of these cells function as the spearhead for larger Islamist militias. \u201cYou can\u2019t come to a compromise with them,\u201d Zeidan says over coffee in a hotel in a small town outside Munich, where he now makes his home. \u201cThey don\u2019t accept the civil state, the state of law, in principle. They want Islamic government. Or fanatic government.\u201d In the vacuum left by the collapse of the state, the fanatics are extending their grip. \u201cThe problem is that there is nobody against them, no intelligence service, no army, no nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo 300 fanatics can have a lot of power.\u201d A balding man in a cheap brown suit, Zeidan hardly looks the part of either a revolutionary leader, which some say he was, or, as others argue, a monster of corruption who fled Tripoli with bars of stolen gold, which are nowhere in evidence during our meeting. In April, Zeidan\u2019s successor, Abdullah al-Thinni, the fourth prime minister since Qaddafi was deposed in 2011, abruptly resigned after gunmen threatened his family. In May, Ahmed Matiq was elected prime minister after another group of gunmen attacked Parliament. When Zeidan left Libya on March 11, his plane was detained on the (then-intact) tarmac at Tripoli International Airport for more than two hours by an Islamist militia that sentenced him to death on live television for corruption and treason. He was allowed to leave only after his personal bodyguard, who had fought against Qaddafi, convinced the Islamists that seizing the prime minister at the airport would start a war. \n The result is a topsy-turvy world in which the state is defenseless against criminals that it funds and arms  One thing entirely clear from the raging chaos that has engulfed Libya is that Qaddafi lives on after his death. He bequeathed to his country a fortune and a uniquely destructive sense of how the political game is played. \u201cIf you are a politician in the U.S. or Great Britain, you have to play within the rules of the game. There is a limit,\u201d Zeidan says. \u201cWith us, there is no limit.\u201d When asked for an example of what he means, Zeidan shrugs. \u201cFor example, when they come and kidnap me and put five guns to my head, trying to play with me, should we pull the trigger,\u201d he says, alluding to one incident, widely reported in the Libyan and international press, in which he was kidnapped from his bedroom at 3 a.m., \u201cI told them, \u2018It is just one moment. Life will go on.\u2019\u2009\u201d Most threats on his life weren\u2019t reported, he says, in part because they were a normal part of his workday. \u201cThey also put a grenade in my office,\u201d he adds. \u201cI told them, \u2018Let us all together go to heaven.\u2019\u2009\u201d It was routine for people to enter his office armed with pistols, rifles, grenades, and even grenade launchers, he says, because the militias were much stronger and better armed than the government\u2019s own security personnel. To say that Libya is currently governed by anyone, he says, is a joke. What Libya needs is security, he says. Without security, Somali-style chaos, fueled by the country\u2019s vast oil wealth, is likely to define the future. Security means boots on the ground, of course. But it wouldn\u2019t take that many soldiers\u2014from Muslim countries, under the auspices of the United Nations or the Arab League\u2014to drive the militias off the streets, he argues, and make Libya secure. Western countries wouldn\u2019t have to send troops but merely provide air support to target the bands of armed tribesmen, raiders, and salafist fanatics who regularly slip in and out of the country. Pressed to suggest foreign countries that might be willing to send troops into Libya, Zeidan can\u2019t name a single one. Criminalizing service to the Libyan state under Qaddafi, he says, has left the state unable to function. \u201cIf you tell all the qualified administrators to stay home and you try to manage the state without them, you are not going to succeed,\u201d he says. While Libya\u2019s democratic experiment might have pleased outside observers from the U.S. and France, Zeidan continues, the country\u2019s elected Parliament was a reflection of the backward and traumatized society produced by Qaddafi. \u201cThey are just people from the market and the fields,\u201d Zeidan says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any idea of what should be done for the state. And some of them are fanatics. They don\u2019t think about country, targets, aims\u2014everybody thinks of what he wants for himself. And some of them, when you say, \u2018This is our country, our nation, our people,\u2019 they laugh.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-07/libya-waste-fraud-erase-billions-in-national-wealth', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 8, 7, 10, 0, 57, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'How Libya Blew Billions and Its Best Chance at Democracy'}, {'articleText': u" Gold gets all the glory, but silver's no slouch. The price of silver has risen 10 percent since the end of May, more than double the gains in gold, bonds and stocks. This comes after a three-year slump when silver was down 50 percent, trailing gold by 30 percent and the S&P 500 Index by 100 percent. Until recently, it had a dubious distinction as one of the few things left in the investment universe that hadn\u2019t rallied in recent years.  Silver suffered a 2.2 percent price drop on July 14 -- gold fell as well -- on fears that the Fed may raise interest rates sooner than expected. Both metals have since rebounded. And the fundamentals look solid: Silver is benefiting from a drop in total supply, a pickup in manufacturing and increased demand from China.  Only about 10 percent of gold is used for industrial purposes, and its price gets whipsawed by sentiment as investors often rush into it as a safe haven. With silver, about half of the demand comes from industrial uses -- it's in everything from cellphones to solar panels. The other half, as with gold, is used for jewelry and as a store of value. So silver's versatility as a sort of dual-purpose metal compared to gold may put it in the sweet spot now, as a portfolio diversifier for investors weary of stocks, and one that's sensitive to improvements in the global economy. Buying an ETF backed by physical silver is the most popular and conservative way to play gold's less glittery cousin. The ETFS Physical Silver Shares (SIVR\n) holds bars of silver in vaults in London and Switzerland. It's up 6.4 percent so far in 2014. It isn't as big or well-known as the $6.7 billion iShares Silver Trust (SLV\n), but does the same thing for nearly half the cost. SIVR charges 0.30 percent a year in fees versus 0.50 percent for SLV. That gap may not seem like much, but it adds up over time. SIVR outperformed SLV by 1.5 percent over the past five years; the difference is due to to SLV\u2019s higher cost. SIVR has $400 million in assets and trades just under 100,000 shares a day. That's a healthy amount of trading and puts SIVR in the top quartile of the most liquid commodity ETFs.  Investors can also consider ETFs that focus on silver mining stocks. The PureFunds ISE Junior Silver Small Cap Miners/Explorers ETF (SILJ\n) tracks small-cap silver miners and explorers. It's up 48 percent, making it one of the top five performers so far this year, and one of the top five most volatile. It's about four times as jumpy as the S&P 500. The ETF is tiny, with $10 million in assets, and charges a high expense ratio of 0.69 percent. Investors comfortable with the credit risk that comes with exchange-traded notes (ETNs) can buy a silver exchange-traded note\n. ETNs are unsecured debt obligations backed by the credit of their issuer, which adds a risk that wouldn't exist with, say, SILJ. The Credit Suisse Silver Shares Covered Call ETN (SLVO\n) has a yield of 16.2 percent, the highest of all exchange-traded products, meaning exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded notes. SLVO essentially makes a bet that silver will rise by buying SLV. Then it turns around and hedges its bet. It does that by selling monthly call options\n on SLV. The call options are agreements that give buyers the right to buy shares of SLV from the ETF over a set period at a set price -- which right now is about 6 percent above the current price. In exchange for that right, the buyer pays the ETF a premium, which is passed along to investors as income.  If SLV doesn't rise 6 percent over the life of the option, then the ETF pockets the income and keeps the SLV shares. If SLV spiked over 6 percent, the buyer of that call option could exercise it and get those SLV shares for less than they're currently worth. So, somewhat perversely, while investors in SLVO are betting that silver will rise, they'll do better if it doesn't rise too much too fast.

Ulbricht\'s defense was also noticeably quick, consisting of less than two full days of testimony, even though\xa0his lawyers initially\xa0indicated their case would take one or two weeks to present. For its part, the prosecution spent over two\xa0weeks piling up evidence that Ulbricht was the mastermind behind the site.  He now faces the possibility of life in prison and is scheduled to\xa0be sentenced in May.\xa0Joshua Dratel, Ulbricht\'s lead attorney, says he will appeal.\xa0"We believe there were significant errors at trial, including the limiting of defense cross-examination, the preclusion of defense experts, and the exclusion of certain defense evidence in the form of documents and other exhibits," he says.\xa0\xa0"The extraordinarily short time the jury spent deliberating for a trial of this length and density demonstrates that these elements had a devastating effect at trial."\xa0 Prosecutors had plenty to work with. Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a Department of Homeland Security Agent, testified about how he had infiltrated\xa0Silk\xa0Road, getting a job working for the Dread Pirate Roberts, the\xa0pseudonymous\xa0leader of the operation. The agent eventually set Ulbricht up to be caught in a public library, logged on to his laptop as the Dread Pirate. The two\xa0men were chatting online at the very moment Ulbricht was arrested. A college friend of Ulbricht\u2019s testified that Ulbricht told him he had made the website,\xa0a notorious online bazaar used mostly to buy and sell drugs but also to traffic in fake IDs, tools for computer hacking, and other contraband. The prosecutors were able to link Bitcoins\xa0that\xa0Ulbricht possessed to Silk Road accounts. The laptop he was using at the time of his arrest contained a diary full of damning confessions.\xa0 The\xa0defense\u2019s strategy to counter all of this\xa0was to admit two basic facts: Ulbricht had founded the site in 2011, and he had been running it in late 2013. But in between, Dratel argued, Ulbricht fled the site and was lured back to it only when the real Dread Pirate Roberts realized the jig was up. Dratel said in his opening statement\xa0that he planned to show how\xa0things that seemed obvious were actually false. His plans were repeatedly undermined by the judge\u2019s decision to side with the prosecutor on key points. Even before\xa0the\xa0case started, in mid-January, Dratel lost his first major battle. He tried to get the bulk of the evidence thrown out, saying the Federal Bureau\xa0of Investigation hadn\u2019t shown that its probe was legal.\xa0Many computer experts suspected the FBI wasn\u2019t telling the whole truth when it described how it found the\xa0Silk\xa0Road\u2019s servers. For outside observers of the case, this was perhaps the most important issue, given its significance for how law enforcement officials conduct digital surveillance in the\xa0future.\xa0 But Judge Katherine Forrest said Ulbricht\xa0couldn\u2019t claim any privacy rights\xa0related\xa0to the servers,\xa0which\xa0were located in Iceland, without admitting he had access to them. He\xa0wouldn\u2019t do so,\xa0and\xa0Forrest barred the defense from discussing any\xa0concerns\xa0about illegal search and seizure.\xa0Before the trial, the\xa0Electronic Frontier Foundation\'s Hanni Fakhoury said that\xa0the\xa0use of this evidence was\xa0potential grounds for appeal.\xa0 The defense was also precluded from capitalizing on one of the most\xa0dramatic\xa0moments of the trial: the revelation that investigators at one time suspected that the Dread Pirate Roberts was actually Mark Karpeles, the disgraced founder of Mt. Gox, once\xa0the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange.\xa0If you\'re looking for gossip from the digital underworld, it doesn\u2019t get much better than this.\xa0Prosecutors objected to much of the discussion about Karpeles, though, and Forrest sided with them\xa0on almost all points.\xa0The juiciest stuff was stricken from the record. Dratel complained that the revelations came from documents that the prosecution itself had\xa0introduced. and claimed that suddenly removing this entire line of\xa0argument from his repertoire in the middle of a trial was unfair. His case, he said, was eviscerated. Forrest was unmoved.\xa0 The reason the defense\u2019s case seemed abridged was that the prosecution also objected to Dratel\u2019s plan to use two expert witnesses: Andreas Antonopoulos, a Bitcoin expert, and Steven Bellovin, a computer science professor at Columbia\xa0University focused on network security. Forrest sided with the\xa0prosecutors, saying\xa0Dratel hadn\u2019t given them enough information about the\xa0nature of the\xa0testimony or enough time to\xa0prepare for\xa0cross-examination. In a scathing\xa0opinion, she admonished the defense for not playing by the rules, saying there were consequences for doing so.\xa0 \u201cWhy did the defense choose to proceed as it has?\u201d she wrote.\xa0\u201cThis court cannot know.\xa0Perhaps a tactical choice not to show the defense\u2019s hand; perhaps to try and accumulate appeal points; perhaps something else.\u201d\xa0 A second trial might turn out\xa0different if Ulbricht\u2019s\xa0lawyers are allowed to pursue the\xa0arguments they had planned on and call the witnesses they wanted to. Maybe not, given the weight of\xa0the evidence presented against him.\xa0 But the lawyers who ran Ulbricht\u2019s case and the judge who oversaw it seem to agree: The jury didn\u2019t hear the best defense that could have been mounted. \xa0', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-05/the-silk-road-defendant-didn-t-stand-a-chance-would-he-on-appeal-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 5, 0, 42, 34, 705000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"The Silk Road Defendant Didn't Stand a Chance.

Even German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said that Greece may need a parallel currency if talks with creditors fail, people familiar with his views told Bloomberg. One version of the idea calls the second currency a TAN, for tax anticipation note. Another calls it a grec, for government reimbursement exchange credit. There\'s also the TCC, for tax credit certificate. In 2014, before becoming Greece\'s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis pitched European governments on the FT-coin, where FT stands for future taxes and coin refers to bitcoin.\xa0 Details differ quite a bit, but the big idea is to free up euros to pay foreign debts and to juice economic growth by spreading more money around domestically. The money would be an IOU issued by\xa0the Greek government that could be passed from one person to another. The government\xa0could print a bunch of the new currency (or create electronic ledger entries if the currency is\xa0virtual) and spend it on whatever governments buy, including civil servants\' salaries.\xa0People would in theory\xa0be willing to accept the\xa0money\xa0because it\xa0could be used to pay taxes.\xa0 Greece doesn\'t have the option of monetary stimulus, because it doesn\'t control its own money\u2014the European Central Bank does. And it can\'t run bigger deficits, because creditors won\'t stand for it. But is this idea anything more than an intellectual exercise? Unfortunately for Greece, probably not.\xa0 "No, it\'s not a good idea, and no, it has no chance of happening," said Jacob Funk Kierkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Introducing it, he said, "would surely aggravate the other Europeans\xa0as well as the ECB. It would politically aggravate the situation that Greece is in." He called it "very primitive and naive, knee-jerk Keynesianism."\xa0 People would naturally be suspicious that the new currency would be funny money, and wouldn\'t accept it on the same terms as euros, Kierkegaard said. Given Greece\'s track record, they would tend to fear that the government would print too much of it, creating an oversupply that would degrade\xa0the currency\'s value. And because the initial allotment would produce a smaller economic spurt than the government was counting on, the government would indeed be tempted to print more, Kierkegaard said. In February, Huw Pill and Themistoklis Fiotakis of Goldman\xa0Sachs International described\xa0the idea of a parallel currency as belonging to a "gray area" between fully staying in the euro zone and completely exiting.\xa0 Backers of parallel-currency concepts say the idea can work. "The grec is emphatically not \'funny money.\' It has a real, tangible value from day one," Alan Harvey, senior economist at the Institute for Dynamic Economic Analysis (IDEA)\xa0in Seattle, wrote in a\xa0paper. It\'s the ability to use the government-created alternative currency to pay taxes that guarantees its value, Harvey said in an interview. Ordinarily money is created through bank lending. "This is a different way of creating money," he said. Parallel currencies are sometimes found in countries that impose controls on the inflow and outflow of money. Cuba has had a nonconvertible peso alongside a convertible CUC, although\xa0it\'s phasing out the latter. Another twist is a local currency like Ithaca Hours, which is used to buy goods and services in the area of Ithaca, N.Y. But even enthusiasts acknowledge problems.\xa0Robert Parenteau, who along with Trond Andresen has written about the\xa0TAN as an electronic parallel currency, said he pitched the Greeks on the concept with the assistance of University of Texas economist Jamie Galbraith, who has worked closely with Varoufakis. He hasn\'t heard back, and now time is running out on the government, he said. "These are academics who are trying to be policymakers," said Parenteau, sole proprietor of\xa0MacroStrategy Edge, an\xa0investment and economic consultancy in Berkeley, Calif. Co-author Andresen is at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. All is not lost,\xa0though, Parenteau said: "Maybe the idea will\xa0take root in Spain or Italy."\xa0', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/petercoy', 'name': u'Peter Coy', 'twitterhandle': u'petercoy'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-01/could-a-parallel-currency-help-save-greece-from-drowning-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 6, 1, 7, 0, 3, 525000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Could a Parallel Currency Help Save Greece From Drowning?'}, {'articleText': u' In December, using bitcoin to pay for a cold Corona at New York City\'s Old Man Hustle bar was a smart move. With the digital currency up 64-fold for the year, patrons got lots of bitcoin bang for their beer. Bitcoin-priced goods were experiencing "massive deflation," Bloomberg Businessweek\'s Peter Coy wrote\n      , as the price of real things in terms of bitcoin plummeted. Coy measured that by creating a Bitcoin Consumer Price Index that was the exact equivalent of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\' Consumer Price Index but measured the prices of goods and services in terms of bitcoins instead of dollars. Here\'s what that looked like for 2013:   And now? The price of a bitcoin is around $442 on CoinDesk, down more than 40 percent from the start of 2014. Bitcoin brew-buying isn\'t nearly as attractive, as massive inflation takes root with items priced in the digital currency. For example, in December one bitcoin bought about 128 Coronas at the Lower East Side bar, not counting tax. It would buy about 74 beers today. The bar has been letting people pay with bitcoin since November and gets about six to 12 transactions a week, says principal owner and crypto-currency disciple Mike Jarmuz. Prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index, meanwhile, rose 0.3 percent in April, after gaining 0.2 percent in March. The Bitcoin Consumer Price Index for 2014 would have those who like to pay for their beer in bitcoin crying in their suds -- or, at the very least, using paper dollars -- as bitcoin inflation soars. The number of bitcoin transactions falls when bitcoin prices rise, says Jarmuz of Old Man Hustle.   The bar owner counts himself among those who aren\'t about to part with their bitcoin at current prices. Jarmuz, who bought bitcoin when it was at $5, is stockpiling the currency. Whenever a patron uses it, he pays for their tab out of his pocket with dollars and takes the bitcoin. He expects the virtual currency to hit $10,000 easily, perhaps within the next 18 to 24 months.

But when it comes to\xa0the volatility of the exchange-traded funds tracking those two markets, it's a (scary) toss-up. The Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF (GREK) and the Deutsche X-Trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) appear to be vying for riskiest ETF1. Both have seen their volatility more than triple in the past 10 days, to levels that surpass even the most hard-core leveraged funds. The two countries' crises are entirely\xa0different. One is a stock market supernova, the other a black hole of debt. But in one sense they're a pair:\xa0GREK and ASHR are both showing\xa0more volatility than the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3x Shares (JNUG). This is basically the most volatile ETF, if not security, on the planet, making bitcoin look like a short-term Treasury note. It\u2019s extremely rare for\xa0an unleveraged ETF, let alone two of them, to beat JNUG at its own game. The Greek ETF has been a roller coaster in the two weeks Greece's\xa0stock market has been closed because of the nation's debt crisis, as\xa0GREK continues to trade in the U.S. On June 29, GREK was down 19 percent; the next day, it was up 6 percent, and it gained another 6 percent the day after. Last week held more sharp ups and downs. Now that a deal has been struck, GREK\u2019s volatility and daily trading volume should begin to subside. And while GREK was the first to see volatility spike, China is now giving Greece a run for its money.\xa0 Here we chart GREK (the orange line) against\xa0ASHR (the white one), which tracks the shares of the 300 largest companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges by volatility.\xa0They are both at 150% or so, about 10 times the number for the S&P 500 Index: ASHR, the most popular and relevant ETF tracking those China shares, was down 7 percent on Tuesday and 11 percent on Wednesday, only to shoot up 20 percent on Thursday and 6 percent on Friday. In addition, 96 of the 300 stocks in ASHR have halted trading.\xa0Despite the short-term pain, ASHR is up 90 percent in the past year, compared with 7 percent for the S&P 500 Index. (The\xa0S&P 500 lost a lot of juice, after a 146 percent run, when the U.S. Federal Reserve ended its bond-buying program last October. Since then, U.S. stocks have been pretty flat as investors anticipate an interest rate hike at some point as well.)\xa0GREK was down 53 percent. Both GREK and ASHR\xa0show how\xa0single-country ETFs can turn incredibly volatile in a flash, often because a government fails or falls or trading is suspended.\xa0That's why most long-term investors gravitate toward broader, more diverse funds for overseas exposure, such as the\xa0Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE).

Until last year, U.S. investors had no direct access to the universe of 2,500 stocks that trade solely in mainland China. The stocks, called China A-shares, have generally been available only to Chinese citizens. They represent $4 trillion in market capitalization and make up two-thirds of China\u2019s stock market. Only 100 of them are also listed on the Hong Kong exchange, which makes them somewhat easier for foreign investors to buy.  ETF issuers are starting to help open up this market to more institutional and retail investors. They're teaming up with Hong Kong companies that China allows to trade a limited amount of A-shares. It's the start of a long effort by the Chinese government to attract foreign investors, which now make up 1 to 2 percent of holders.  In October China will allow Hong Kong brokers to take buy and sell orders for 568 A-share companies, but only from Hong Kong investors and only up to $210 million a day. It's a small but positive step. The hope is that more such steps will eventually lead the big global index providers to integrate A-shares into their indexes, which would increase demand. For example, A-shares could eventually be a 10 percent weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, according to MSCI. The index has $1.4 trillion of assets that use it as a benchmark. That means over $100 billion worth of demand could come from being included in that one index, albeit incrementally. It won't start soon: MSCI and Standard & Poor's recently said they wouldn't include the shares in the index because of the restrictions on trading shares.  On a valuation basis, the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300, which tracks the 300 largest and most liquid A-shares, looks cheap. The average price-earnings ratio is about 10. That's well below the price-earnings ratios of the S&P 500 Index and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which are 18 and 17, respectively. On top of the CSI 300's lower price-earnings ratios, its shares are trading, on average, at the lowest discount in eight years when compared to mainland China shares traded on the Hong Kong exchange, called H-shares. One advantage of China A-shares is that they don't move in line with the U.S. market. In investor-speak, there's no correlation with U.S. stocks. In comparison, over the past 10 years the correlation of the U.S. market with the H-shares in the MSCI China Index was 0.70, and 0.35 for the MSCI Frontier Markets Index. Lack of correlation has become increasingly difficult to find in this connected world.  There are obvious risks to A-shares. There are the overall worries about the Chinese government's unpredictability. Some investors shy away from investing directly in China because of concerns over corporate governance and accounting. There's also the fear that China's economy will suffer a sharp slowdown after a period of rapid growth. And some of the hottest Chinese tech plays, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s coming initial public offering, are not A-shares but U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. The first China A-share ETF to physically hold the shares came out last November. There are now four, and 15 in registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to ETF.com. The products have been slow to attract money, as investors don\u2019t know much about this new area, and because China A-shares are down 7 percent so far this year. Here's a look at the available options:db X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares Fund (ASHR\n)  This was the first A-share ETF to market when it came out in November. The $210 million ETF tracks the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300. The financial sector is that index's heaviest allocation, at 38 percent. ASHR, which is down 8 percent so far in 2014, charges investors 0.82 percent of assets annually. DB recently launched a small-cap sequel to ASHR, the db X-trackers Harvest CSI 500 China-A Shares Small Cap Fund (ASHS\n). Market Vectors ChinaAMC A-Share (PEK\n) PEK does the same thing as ASHR and has the same return for the year to date. It's significantly smaller, at $24 million, and slightly cheaper; it charges investors 0.72 percent of assets annually. Market Vectors is coming out with a mid- and small-cap A-share ETF called the Market Vectors ChinaAMC-ChiNext ETF (CNXT). It starts trading July 24. KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A Shares (KBA\n) KBA differentiates itself by offering broader exposure to A-shares. It holds 442 stocks, including more mid- and small-caps. The fund, with just $3 million in assets, charges investors 0.85 percent of assets annually. It launched in March and its performance is flat for the year.  Investors can also buy an all-China ETF that tracks A-shares along with all the other types of shares. There's only one on the market -- the db X-trackers Harvest MSCI All China Equity ETF (CN\n), which launched on April 30.More stories from Eric Balchunas: Follow Bitcoin by Bitcoin, the Winklevoss ETF Inches Closer to Reality\n on twitter Eric Balchunas is an exchange-traded-fund analyst at Bloomberg.

Charlie Shrem, 24, was arrested as he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Jan. 26 after giving a speech in Amsterdam. In addition to his role with the foundation, an industry representative to regulators formed to oversee the currency\u2019s software protocol, he was also chief executive officer of BitInstant, a Bitcoin exchange company. By charging Shrem, a prominent evangelist for the currency who prosecutors called a \u201cBitcoin millionaire\u201d at his bail hearing yesterday, the government has reached into the circle of people responsible for the promotion and standardization of the currency. Shrem denied the charges through his lawyer. \u201cBitcoin is in the process of getting institutionalized,\u201d said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. \u201cEarly on it was exploited by bad guys because it was still very raw and accessible,\u201d he said. \u201cAs more investors and businesses get involved, it\u2019s going to get harder and harder to use it for illicit purposes.\u201d Shrem, of New York, was freed on $1 million bond, subject to his remaining under house arrest, after prosecutors said he was a flight risk because of his frequent international travels, his claim to have a net worth of $6 million and to own a plane. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions. It has gained traction with merchants selling everything from Sacramento Kings basketball tickets to kitchen mixers on Overstock.com. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are seeking regulatory approval for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, invested more than $1 million in BitInstant. The Winklevoss brothers aren\u2019t under investigation in the case, a person familiar with the matter said. In a statement yesterday, the Winklevoss brothers said BitInstant \u201cmade a commitment to us that they would abide\xa0by all applicable laws,\u201d and that they were passive investors in the company. The brothers are scheduled to participate today in a panel as the New York Department of Financial Services begins an inquiry to determine how to regulate virtual currencies. \u201cTruly innovative business models don\u2019t need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act,\u201d Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said yesterday in a statement. Bitcoin had dropped by 6.4 percent at 5:36 p.m. yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Shrem discovered Bitcoins on a website in early 2011, when he was a senior at Brooklyn College, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in April. While there, he started BitInstant, which allowed its customers to purchase the digital currency via more than 700,000 stores, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Walgreen Co.\u2019s Duane Reade. Another of BitInstant\u2019s investors was Roger Ver, who ran for California State Assembly in 2000 as a Libertarian. Shrem called Ver \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d for the way he promoted the currency by giving away coins to anyone who would take them. Federal prosecutors first charged Ross William Ulbricht, the alleged operator of Silk Road who used the name \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d last October for running the online marketplace from January 2011 to last September. In December, Bharara\u2019s office charged three more former Silk Road employees with helping run the website. All of the defendants have pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court. Also charged yesterday was Robert Faiella, accused of being an underground Bitcoin exchanger tied to Silk Road. The two men are accused of engaging in a scheme to sell Bitcoins to Silk Road users, allowing them to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously and beyond the reach of law enforcement authorities. They are charged with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Shrem is also charged with willfully failing to file suspicious activity reports about Faiella\u2019s transactions through his company, in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. Prosecutors said the men could face more than a decade in prison if convicted. \u201cWorking together, Shrem and Faiella exchanged over $1 million in cash for Bitcoins for the benefit of Silk Road users, so that the users could, in turn, make illegal purchases on Silk Road,\u201d Bharara said, adding that the probe is \u201congoing.\u201d Shrem was aware Silk Road was being used to buy and sell illegal drugs and said in one e-mail that such sales funded \u201ca decent percentage of the overall Bitcoin economy,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cWow, Silk Road actually works,\u201d he said in another e-mail, explaining that he had received a shipment of marijuana brownies, prosecutors said. Shrem, whose company ceased operations in about July, made his initial court appearance yesterday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman in Manhattan. The judge said he may be freed on bail and remain at his parents\u2019 Brooklyn home under electronic monitoring. Shrem didn\u2019t enter a plea. With close-cropped hair and a beard, Shrem wore a charcoal gray hooded sweatshirt, jeans and loafers at his bail hearing, with his parents and other relatives in the courtroom. \u201cThese are mere allegations,\u201d Shrem\u2019s lawyer, Keith Miller, said yesterday in court. \u201cWe ask the court for the opportunity for Mr. Shrem to go home with his family,\u201d Miller said. \u201cMr. Shrem has no prior criminal background. He\u2019s 24 years old. His parents are here and willing to put up their life savings and their homes\u201d as part of his bail package. Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner argued that Shrem shouldn\u2019t be freed on bond, calling him a \u201cBitcoin millionaire\u201d who has \u201ca strong incentive to flee.\u201d Turner said Shrem had bragged he owned his own plane and told court officials in an interview after his arrest that he had a net worth of more than $6 million. Miller told the judge that the government had miscalculated his client\u2019s wealth. \u201cNot only does he face a strong incentive to flee, Mr. Shrem has voiced a strong intent to flee,\u201d Serrin told Pitman, and played an October 2012 YouTube.com video in which Shrem discusses the government\u2019s probe of Bitcoin operators. \u201cThe thing is, what the government can also do is try to arrest or take down companies that help push Bitcoin ahead. So our company, which acts as a bridge between Bitcoin and dollars, were it taken out, it\u2019ll be, you know, Bitcoin would take a hit,\u201d Shrem said. \u201cBut we have contingency plans,\u201d Shrem tells the interviewer. \u201cI have a plane ticket ready to take me to Singapore. There\u2019s another corporation already set up.\u201d Turner said Shrem has taken at least 16 international trips since 2007, and has traveled to at least nine countries since 2012, including Turkey, Panama, Aruba, Mexico, the Netherlands, Bahamas and Iceland. The judge ordered Shrem to surrender his passport and other travel documents. Faiella, who was arrested yesterday at his Florida home, was ordered held in custody until a hearing tomorrow in Fort Myers. Russell Rosenthal, a federal defender who represented Faiella yesterday, declined to comment about his client\u2019s case. Faiella, 52, is accused of running his illegal exchange on the Silk Road website. Using the name \u201cBTCKing\u201d he sold the currency to users seeking to buy illegal drugs on the site, the U.S. said. Shrem bought drugs on Silk Road, and was \u201cfully aware that Silk Road was a drug-trafficking website,\u201d the government said. \u201cShrem knowingly facilitated Faiella\u2019s business with the company in order to maintain Faiella\u2019s business as a lucrative source of company revenue,\u201d Bharara said. Shrem was accused of knowingly allowing Faiella to use his company\u2019s services to buy Bitcoins for Silk Road customers, and also of personally processing Faiella\u2019s orders, giving him discounts on his high-volume transactions and failing to file suspicious activity reports. Shrem and Faiella parted ways after the company stopped accepting cash payments for Bitcoins in late 2012, the U.S. alleged. Faiella temporarily shut his service as a result and later resumed operating on Silk Road in April 2013 without assistance from Shrem\u2019s company, exchanging tens of thousands of dollars a week until Silk Road\u2019s website was shut down by law enforcement authorities in October, prosecutors alleged. This month, about 29,600 Bitcoins worth $28 million were seized from Silk Road. The forfeiture order, signed Jan. 15 by U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken, was the largest forfeiture of Bitcoins, according to the government. Jinyoung Englund, a spokeswoman for the Bitcoin Foundation, said in an e-mailed statement that the group was \u201csurprised and shocked\u201d by the charges. \u201cWe take these allegations seriously and do not condone illegal activity,\u201d she said. U.S. Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, said in a statement that the arrests underscore how digital currencies can be used for illegal purposes. \u201cThere are many who believe that digital currencies are an important and valuable new technology, and who want the opportunity to play by the rules in bringing potentially valuable products to the marketplace,\u201d Carper said, calling for the federal government to look at the potential promises and risks. In a speech yesterday to the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists in New York, Bharara said the \u201cmessage\u201d of the case was a simple one. \u201cIf you want to develop a virtual currency or a virtual currency exchange business, knock yourself out,\u201d Bharara said. \u201cBut you have to follow the rules. All of them. And if you want to invest in such a business, you better kick the tires and make sure compliance there is not a joke.\u201d The case is U.S. v.

Just a fraction of the files have been made public, but they outline the National Security Agency\u2019s massive information-collection system. They\u2019ve thrown light onto the methods of an arm of the government used to working in the shadows and started an intense debate over national security and personal liberty. One of the earliest and most explosive revelations was the existence of Prism, a top-secret program giving the NSA direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, and other U.S. Internet companies. Snowden himself remains something of a mystery even as the U.S. government attempts to obtain his return from Russia, where he\u2019s in hiding, and very possibly jail him for the rest of his life. As an infrastructure analyst for the NSA, he came to understand at a high level how information moves around the Internet. Snowden almost certainly relied on one very specific and powerful tool to cover his tracks. In photographs he\u2019s often with his laptop, and on the cover of his computer, a sticker shows a purple and white onion: the \u201co\u201d in the word \u201cTor.\u201d Tor, an acronym for \u201cthe onion router,\u201d is software that provides the closest thing to anonymity on the Internet. Engineered by the Tor Project, a nonprofit group, and offered free of charge, Tor has been adopted by both agitators for liberty and criminals. It sends chat messages, Google searches, purchase orders, or e-mails on a winding path through multiple computers, concealing activities as the layers of an onion cover its core, encrypting the source at each step to hide where one is and where one wants to go. Some 5,000 computers around the world, volunteered by their owners, serve as potential hop points in the path, obscuring requests for a new page or chat. Tor Project calls these points relays. Its users are global, from Iranian activists who eluded government censors to transmit images and news during the 2009 protests following that year\u2019s presidential election, to Chinese citizens who regularly use it to get around the country\u2019s Great Firewall and its blocks on everything from Facebook to the New York Times. In addition to facilitating anonymous communication online, Tor is an access point to the \u201cdark Web,\u201d vast reaches of the Internet that are intentionally kept hidden and don\u2019t show up in Google or other search engines, often because they harbor the illicit, from child porn to stolen credit card information. It\u2019s perhaps the most effective means of defeating the online surveillance efforts of intelligence agencies around the world, including the most sophisticated agency of them all, the NSA. That\u2019s ironic, because Tor started as a project of the U.S. government. More than half of the Tor Project\u2019s revenue in 2012, or $1.24 million, came from government grants, including an $876,099 award from the Department of Defense, according to financial statements available on the project\u2019s website. Yet because of Snowden, we now know that the NSA has been working to unpeel the protective layers built by the Tor system. Along with evidence of the NSA\u2019s mass data collection, Snowden leaked an agency presentation that demonstrated just how surveillance-proof the software is. It was titled \u201cTor Stinks.\u201d The spooks, according to the slide deck, were thwarted by the software at every turn. Gaining access to some Tor relays, for example, didn\u2019t work, because they had to control all three computers in a circuit to defeat the encryption. \u201cWe will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time. With manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users,\u201d one slide reads. NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said in an e-mailed statement: \u201cIt should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies seek ways to counteract targets\u2019 use of technologies to hide their communications. Throughout history, nations have used various methods to protect their secrets, and today terrorists, cybercriminals, human traffickers, and others use technology to hide their activities. Our intelligence community would not be doing its job if we did not try to counter that.\u201d Countering Tor is clearly frustrating for the NSA, and Internet users have taken note. Hits to Tor\u2019s download page almost quadrupled last year, to 139 million. \u201cEncryption works,\u201d Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert who helped the Guardian analyze the Snowden documents, said at a talk in New York in January. \u201cThat\u2019s the lesson of Tor. The NSA can\u2019t break Tor, and it pisses them off.\u201d\xa0\xa0Tor\u2019s world headquarters occupies one room of a YWCA in Cambridge, Mass. Its neighbor is Transition House, which helps survivors of domestic abuse. Of 33 \u201ccore people\u201d listed on Tor\u2019s website, nine are full-time employees, and the majority work remotely. For the most part, the project is crowdsourced: Hundreds of volunteers around the world work on improving Tor\u2019s software and solving technical challenges like staying ahead of censors in China, which has devoted enormous resources to shutting down anti-censorship tools, including Tor. A request to visit the office in person provoked some mild skepticism from Kelley Misata, who handles press for the group. \u201cThe Tor team is primarily virtual (and spread around the world),\u201d she e-mailed, \u201cso our office is made up of only a few members of the team working there on a regular basis.\u201d On a Friday in December, Executive Director Andrew Lewman, Misata, and a researcher named Sarah Cortes showed up to talk at the office, which has the air of a temporary camp, with little d\xe9cor other than an enlarged Tor logo stuck between two windows and one Ikea run\u2019s worth of furniture. We sat at a tall table surrounded by stools that required an awkward perch. \n  Lewman, 43, has longish dark hair threaded with gray and pulled back by a headband, accentuating heavy eyebrows and large dark eyes. He swallows audibly and speaks quickly. He says he first came across Tor in 2003, when he was working for a large international company with employees in China\u2014he won\u2019t say which one\u2014who needed to get around Beijing\u2019s increasing Internet controls. Tor was an effective and inexpensive solution, and he began volunteering as a code developer, eventually designing the software\u2019s user interface. He\u2019s been executive director since 2009. \u201cPeople now know about Tor. They\u2019ve heard the name,\u201d he says.\u2009\u201cWhat most of the world takes away is this privacy stuff exists, there\u2019s this thing called Tor, and the NSA doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d Lewman seems, if not tired of talking about the NSA, at least eager to shift discussion to the many uses of Tor that are totally unrelated to three-letter agencies. When the Chinese government clamped down on the Internet in 2009 to ensure a triumphant 60th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, Tor saw a spike in use in the country. Teenagers in the Boston exurb of Natick installed it on school-issued laptops so they could get on Facebook, to the school district\u2019s displeasure. Lewman also works with victims of domestic violence, teaching them to get online without revealing to abusers their location and activities. Tor and Transition House are developing guidelines for women at the shelter regarding technology use and online safety. For Lewman\u2014as with other people behind Tor\u2014the cause has a personal side. When he worked for an Internet marketing firm in the mid 2000s, a consumer, irritated by marketing e-mails, found Lewman\u2019s name on the website and began to threaten him, and then his family, online. The stalker eventually showed up at the office, requiring intervention by the police. \n  Misata has also had her privacy invaded online. A former colleague cyberstalked her for five years, she says, including posting nasty allegations that topped Google results, complicating job applications. She became an advocate and motivational speaker against cyber harassment. When she heard Lewman speak in 2012, she decided Tor was the safest place for her to work. \u201cA lot of the conversations that I have in D.C., when they stand on their soapbox and say, \u2018Tor is only used by bad guys,\u2019 it\u2019s very easy for me to step back and say, \u2018Here\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to keep the network open for those who need it,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Misata, who is pursuing a Ph.D. at Purdue University and researching the use of technology in human trafficking. Lewman\u2019s message is the same, whether he\u2019s talking to teenagers, Fortune 500 companies, or the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, whose agents must maintain deep cover as they infiltrate smuggling and production networks: Everything on the Internet is tracked and recorded, and you might not want that. \u201cA simple question I ask companies is, \u2018What do you Google for?\u2019\u2009\u201d Lewman says. \u201cA number of firms are starting to realize, when we are doing sensitive things, we shouldn\u2019t be doing it \u2018naked\u2019 on the Internet.\u201d Companies routinely use Internet traffic analysis to track what\u2019s coming from competitors\u2019 IP addresses. Searches for patents on specific technologies can lead to hints about what another company is planning. What if a company wants to research a competitor\u2019s pricing? Chances are, Lewman says, if they\u2019re doing it without cloaking their identity, they\u2019ll get answers tailored for them, not the answers a real customer would get. Living up to its credo of anonymity online, Tor doesn\u2019t have detailed data on its users. They\u2019re clearly not all noble political dissidents, though. Tor had a cameo in October in the FBI takedown of the online drug market, Silk Road, an operation that took years for the Feds to crack because it operated exclusively on the network. Tor estimates that users currently number about 300,000 a day, down from a peak of more than half a million a day over the summer. \u201cTor\u2019s biggest problem is press. No one hears about that time someone wasn\u2019t stalked by their abuser. They hear how somebody got away with downloading child porn,\u201d says Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties advocacy group in San Francisco. \u201cThe reason bad guys use Tor is because it works better than anything else. But at the same time, if there was no Tor, bad guys would still find a way of maintaining their anonymity and everyone else would be left out in the cold.\u201d\xa0\xa0Paul Syverson at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington is one of the world\u2019s foremost researchers on encrypting and routing data and one of Tor\u2019s creators. He works in the lab\u2019s Center for High Assurance Computer Systems, where a joke nameplate outside his office reads \u201ccryptologicist.\u201d I meet him in December in an all-purpose room stuffed with detritus, including a vacuum cleaner, half-dead plants, some battered cardboard boxes, and shelves crammed with old journals. White dust from a chalkboard scrawled over with formulas covers the floor and chairs. Syverson, 55, has a Ph.D. in philosophy and looks distinctly unmilitary in an oversize flannel shirt and cargo pants. \u201cThe thing we had in mind when we started working on it was to protect government workers going on the public Internet,\u201d he says, specifically analysts doing open-source intelligence gathering. That was in 1995, the Internet\u2019s infancy. By 1996 the research lab had a publicly accessible onion routing system in place, hosted on a Navy server with virtual relays, to demonstrate the concept. In 2000, Syverson met Roger Dingledine, whose graduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had focused on the creation of an anonymous online publishing system. Syverson persuaded Dingledine, and eventually another MIT graduate named Nick Mathewson, to help him develop an onion router that could be deployed on the wider Internet. (Dingledine is now project leader of the Tor Project and a researcher and advocate for privacy-enhancing technologies; Mathewson, a director and researcher, continues to help develop the software.) \u201cThe basic notion of onion routing is that you have a distributed collection of computers that are scattered around, and you build a cryptographic circuit,\u201d Syverson says. \u201cWe wanted it to work with parts of the Internet that don\u2019t know anything about onion routing.\u201d \n  The group developed the system as it works today, creating a routing process in which the cryptographic keys for each leg of the path are separate and ephemeral, so that no one can go back and decrypt old traffic. It\u2019s one of the elements that has frustrated the NSA\u2014in the original design, a single hostile node could record traffic and compromise the rest of the system. For the onion router to work properly, the Navy needed to step back from running it. A cloaking system is not useful if all the cloaks say \u201cNavy\u201d on them. \u201cIf you have a system that\u2019s only a Navy system, anything popping out of it is obviously from the Navy,\u201d Syverson says. \u201cYou need to have a network that carries traffic for other people as well.\u201d Tor Project was incorporated as a nonprofit in 2006 to manage operations. In technical terms, Tor provides privacy by separating identity from routing online. In a normal session online, you\u2019re browsing from your computer or a router that\u2019s assigned its own IP address. Every request you send out carries that address, and information is returned there. When you use Tor, instead of your chat message, or the URL you type going directly to its destination, it\u2019s routed through Tor\u2019s network of volunteer nodes, moving through at least three of them, before exiting the network and proceeding to the endpoint. The website that receives it doesn\u2019t know what your IP address is, nor does any point in the Tor circuit except for the entry relay. For most users, a Tor session does not feel different from going on the Web with the Firefox browser. But all the winding through relays does slow things down, and the default settings disable some functions for security reasons\u2014including plugins that allow videos\u2014but they can be turned back on. Despite being designed to enable secrecy, Tor\u2019s methods are almost totally transparent. From the start, Tor has been built on open-source code, meaning the software\u2019s building blocks are freely available. Anyone with the skill to read code can look at how it\u2019s built and how it works\u2014and help improve it. \n  Such transparency is one of the organization\u2019s key tenets. The Snowden documents have revealed the NSA\u2019s effort to undermine encryption techniques and insert \u201cback doors,\u201d or deliberate vulnerabilities, into hardware and software that the NSA can then use to get into and spy on systems. In December, the German magazine Der Spiegel revealed the existence of vulnerabilities for commercially developed systems from the likes of Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems. (When contacted by Der Spiegel, both companies denied having knowledge of such back doors or collaborating with the government; Juniper reiterated this to Bloomberg Businessweek.) With Tor\u2019s code open for all to see and examine, flaws can\u2019t remain hidden\u2014or as easy to exploit. Syverson and other researchers have written voluminously about Tor\u2019s weaknesses. The network operates within the wider Web, and the way users behave and configure their computers outside Tor is one of the biggest sources of insecurity. One way the NSA found to get around Tor\u2019s software and spy on users was an attack called \u201cEgotisticalGiraffe,\u201d exploiting a vulnerability in the Firefox browser. Another approach was to try to reconstruct the encrypted path to find the identity of a Tor user by monitoring relays, according to the \u201cTor Stinks\u201d presentation. Success with this approach was \u201cnegligible,\u201d because all three hops in the circuit had to be part of the set NSA could monitor, and the agency had access to few of them. Tor exerts little control over who volunteers to host traffic, and researchers have found evidence of abuse, such as cases where an operator is snooping on traffic. The group has worked on solving that problem by ranking some relay points as more trusted than others, and giving users the ability to choose a set of trusted computers for the first relay. Tor has evolved in other ways to stay ahead of what are sometimes referred to on its website as adversaries. Because Tor keeps a public list of all its relays\u2014the IP addresses that volunteer to route Tor users\u2019 requests\u2014the Chinese government has tried blocking all of those IP addresses. To get around that, Tor in 2009 invented \u201cbridges,\u201d relays provided upon request to users who are blocked from regular Tor relays. Bridges aren\u2019t listed in a public directory, making them more difficult to block. There is a deeper layer of Tor, where information is hosted, called hidden services. These sites are tagged with the extension \u201c.onion\u201d and can only be accessed using Tor. A regular Internet user\u2019s traffic goes through at least three hops; hidden services traffic goes through at least six. Iranian activists during the Green Movement protests in 2009 maintained blogs and websites using hidden services, according to Lewman. The drug bazaar Silk Road operated as a hidden service. You couldn\u2019t find and use Silk Road with a Google search\u2014its IP address was hidden from users. Those who wanted to buy drugs on the site had to use Tor as their browser, type in Silk Road\u2019s .onion address, and use Bitcoins to pay for their purchases. There is naturally suspicion that the NSA has in fact cracked Tor. In September a security researcher, Robert Graham of Errata Security, analyzed almost 23,000 connections to a relay he\u2019d set up, and concluded that the majority were vulnerable to NSA decryption. Three-quarters of the traffic he monitored used an older version of Tor based on encryption keys that \u201ceveryone seems to agree\u201d the NSA can break, he wrote. Version 2.4 of Tor\u2019s software uses a different form of encryption keys, based on something called elliptic curves, which are more difficult to decode\u2014but according to Graham\u2019s analysis only a small subset of users have upgraded to that software version. Conspiracy theories abound. On one Reddit discussion about Tor\u2019s links to the government, an anonymous poster asked: \u201cHow can we be sure that TOR isn\u2019t a front for the CIA or FBI? I mean, it\u2019s too easy to just download, install, and be on your merry way browsing in \u2018anonymity.\u2019\u2009\u201d \n  Lewman\u2019s job, as he tries to drum up more funding and more volunteers to host relays, is to counter such thinking, which the Snowden revelations have, ironically, added to. \u201cPeople have such fear of the NSA and the CIA and all these other three-letter organizations,\u201d he says, \u201cthat they\u2019re just like, \u2018Whoa, I don\u2019t want anything to do with that whatsoever.\u2019\u2009\u201d More bandwidth, Lewman says, is what Tor needs most. He says he wants to increase Tor\u2019s capacity by getting universities to run it and work out all the kinks before business puts in real money\u2014citing the example of Facebook, which also started on campus. Major corporations are interested in using Tor, but they expect a ready-made product that\u2019s already incorporated into the big enterprise packages provided by companies such as Cisco. So far, few large corporations have offered to host relays, he says. It\u2019s the kind of thing the Tor developers might discuss at their next meeting. Asked how often the \u201cvirtual team\u201d gets together in person, Misata says she\u2019s in the midst of organizing one of two such annual get-togethers for February. The core group of 30-plus spends the first half of the week discussing current and future initiatives and \u201cbonding\u201d and the second half hosting public meetings to spread the word of Tor. For privacy reasons, some in the developers group refuse to come to the U.S. For the gathering, Misata ended up choosing Iceland.

The magazine published the results of an investigation concluding that Dorian S. Nakamoto, a former defense industry and U.S. government employee, is the mysterious computer coding and cryptography expert who authored the seminal paper on Bitcoin and created the software that serves as the backbone of the currency\u2019s system. The initial Bitcoin paper carried the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Since the author otherwise chose to remain private and anonymous, it had been widely assumed the name was a pseudonym. The Nakamoto living in Temple City used to be named Satoshi, Newsweek said. \u201cFascinating,\u201d Martti Malmi, a Finnish programmer who worked with Nakamoto on the Bitcoin code, wrote on Twitter. \u201cSatoshi seems not much different than how I imagined him.\u201d No one answered the door today at the Nakamoto home, a split-level house in a suburban Temple City neighborhood where journalists gathered to seek his comment. Peter Lam, 53, a real-estate agent who has lived on the street since 2001, said he\u2019d talked to Dorian Nakamoto and his parents a few times. He said Dorian wasn\u2019t especially sociable. Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation who had been one of the few people to communicate with Satoshi Nakamoto, didn\u2019t immediately indicate whether he could identify Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin\u2019s creator. Andresen said in a message on Twitter that he regrets talking to the magazine about Nakamoto. He said he was disappointed that Newsweek decided to \u201cdox,\u201d or document, the Nakamoto family. Until now, Satoshi Nakamoto was thought to be a pseudonym for a programmer or group of programmers who wrote the paper and the initial source code for Bitcoin. The code has since been handed off to a loose group of experts affiliated with the foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group. The paper, first published in 2008, offered a proof of the basic concept of Bitcoin, which uses a public ledger and a network of voluntary computers, known as \u201cminers,\u201d to validate transactions that are signed with encrypted signatures. After the initial source code created the first batches of Bitcoin, it grew from an obsession of specialists into a global phenomenon. Merchants around the world now accept Bitcoin for everything from kitchen appliances on Overstock.com to luxury goods listed on BitPremier, a website. It also trades for traditional currencies, and was priced at $648.27 at 1:57 New York time today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. According to Newsweek reporter Leah McGrath Goodman, when Dorian Nakamoto was confronted at his home before publication and asked about Bitcoin, he responded, \u201cI am no longer involved in that and cannot discuss it. It\u2019s been turned over to other people.\u201d Some Bitcoin enthusiasts said they were skeptical that Newsweek had found the right person. Others said they were furious that the news media would try to violate his privacy. \u201cI would have thought every Satoshi Nakamoto on planet Earth had already been contacted and ruled out,\u201d Stephen Pair, the chief technical officer at Atlanta-based BitPay, a payment processor. \u201cIf this person is the real Satoshi, it would be easy to for him to prove it if he wanted to.\u201d Jeff Garzik, one of the core developers on the Bitcoin software protocol and an employee of BitPay, said \u201cthe \u2018real\u2019 Satoshi\u201d can prove his identity only through cryptography. \u201cWe will know Satoshi by his digital signatures,\u201d Garzik said in an e-mail, adding that the founder could either sign a message using his unique encryption key or make use of the Bitcoins that the creator is known to have kept. Analysts who looked at the Bitcoin ledger have concluded that the creator of the system owns about 1 million coins, worth over $600 million at current prices, said Jered Kenna, a San Francisco Bitcoin investor. If the owner pledged never to sell or trade them, it would help add stability to what has been a volatile market, Kenna said. Adam Draper, the chief executive officer of Boost, a San Mateo, California, company that incubates Bitcoin startups, called the Newsweek article \u201cintrusive\u201d and said he\u2019s unconvinced. \u201cIf Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to be anonymous the whole time, why would he use his real name on the paper?\u201d Draper said. \u201cHe always used non-tracking e-mails and did everything he could to stay anonymous, so it\u2019s difficult for me to understand why he would use his real name.\u201d Newsweek said Dorian Nakamoto, who was born in Japan, attended California State Polytechnic University, worked for defense contractors on classified military projects and eventually the Federal Aviation Administration. He adopted the first name Dorian in 1973, according to court documents cited by Newsweek. Tim Lynch, a spokesman for California Polytechnic, confirmed that a Satoshi Nakamoto earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics from its Pomona campus in 1973. He declined to provide any more information, citing privacy rules. The revelations will not affect the Bitcoin network, said Gregory Maxwell, one of the core developers on the project. The code is now out of Nakamoto\u2019s hands, and can\u2019t be changed except by broad consensus among the users of the network. \u201cThere has been extensive rewriting and reorganization since the time when the creator of the system ended his involvement,\u201d Maxwell said in an e-mail. Jerry Brito, director of technology policy at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University, said that if Satoshi Nakamoto has been found it could be a good thing for the digital currency. \u201cI knew this day would come,\u201d Brito said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for Nakamoto, who seems like an upstanding -- if eccentric -- citizen who just wants to maintain his privacy.

Here are my picks for the 10 that are most likely to change how we live and work: Home 3D printing. With several companies introducing 3D printers for home use, you\u2019ll soon be able to produce toys, belts, cups, spare parts, and other plastic items at home as easily as printing a document. 3D Systems (DDD) is launching CubeJet, a unit about the size of a microwave that prints full-color plastic objects. The company also offers CeraJet for producing ceramics and ChefJet for creating fancy chocolate- and sugar-based confections. Instead of buying small objects, you can simply buy the designs online and print them out at home. Health and fitness monitors. Health care and fitness training are getting better through inexpensive monitoring devices that track everything from blood pressure to oxygen intake, send the results to a cloud website, and allow you and your doctor to analyze the output. IHealth makes a wireless blood pressure monitor and a glucose monitor for diabetics. The Withings Smart Body Analyzer tracks weight, body fat, heart rate, and air quality. Netamo is introducing a broach called June that measures exposure to ultraviolet rays so you know when to get out of the sun. Meanwhile, Fortiori Design is offering the Moxy Muscle Oxygen Monitor for athletes who want to improve their training. Sleep and relaxation. We\u2019re all going to be sleeping better and relaxing more, thanks to some of the latest gadgets that measure sleep and stress. InteraXon is launching the Muse Brain Sensing Headband, a lightweight headband that measures brain waves to help coach users to relax (think more alpha waves). Select Comfort, maker of Sleep Number beds, has a system called Sleep IQ for its higher-end mattresses that measures brain waves, heart rate, respiration rate, and how much you move throughout the night. It adjusts the bed while you doze to improve your sleep quality. Eye and hand tracking. If you\u2019re sick of dirty touchscreens, SoftKinetic has DepthSense, which tracks hand and finger motions, allowing you to select items on the screen without actually touching it. Even more impressive, EyeTech is introducing AEye, a device that tracks eye movements so you can operate touchscreens by simply looking at what you want to select. Drones. While Jeff Bezos\u2019s vision of drones for\xa0Amazon.com deliveries may be many years off, unmanned aerial vehicles are being launched now for a variety of other applications. The new Parrot SenseFly eBee is a small drone with an HD camera that\u2019s programmed to provide automated aerial mapping. It\u2019s being marketed to farmers to check on their crops and developers to assess building sites. Curved-screen TVs. Many higher-end TVs this year are coming with curved screens that provide a more cinematic viewing experience by positioning the outer edges of the screen more optimally for the eye.\xa0LG Electronics is so committed to the new feature that it\u2019s even launching a curved-screen smartphone, which the company claims improves the viewing of movies when the device is held horizontally. Self-driving cars. Both Audi and BMW demonstrated models of driverless cars at the show, which use a host of cameras, sensors, and GPS systems to navigate. While there are several hurdles to overcome, many of these cars\u2019 features\u2013such as sign recognition, lane departure warnings, and pedestrian recognition\u2013may soon be incorporated into existing vehicles. Bitcoin. The virtual currency is making a push to go mainstream this year. BitPay, essentially a bank for Bitcoins, was signing up new business at CES. BitPay will process Bitcoin transactions for merchants, convert the transactions to dollars, and guarantee the transactions against currency fluctuation. It already has 12,000 merchants signed up. Bots. Robots are moving from novelty status into more mainstream applications. The show featured several new bots, such as the Grill Bot, for scrubbing barbecue grills, and the Soloshot Robot Cameraman, a camera that can be programmed to follow a specific individual through daily tasks. Smart homes. Many home appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, can now be controlled via smartphone apps. This year\u2019s show featured an even wider range of appliances, door locks, thermostats, and even lightbulbs. The Tabu Lumen Smart Bulb has a built-in computer chip and Bluetooth, so you can change the brightness or color of it through a smartphone app.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-13/top-10-innovations-from-ces-2014-drones-3d-printing-and-bitcoin', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 13, 21, 11, 39, 289000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Ten Innovations From CES You Should Know About'}, {'articleText': u' Kristen Geil, a writer for an Internet marketing firm in Chicago, heard about Venmo for the first time two summers ago. Her new roommate, who had just arrived in town from New York, was raving about this app that allows users to send and receive payments over their smartphones. There was also a social media component to the app that made the mundane act of splitting bills kind of fun. She assured Geil that it was safe and reliable. Plus, there was no waiting around for checks to clear and no trudging to an ATM for cash. Geil agreed to give it a try. After downloading Venmo onto her iPhone, she hooked it up to her bank account, synced it with her existing network of contacts from Facebook, and got started. The sign-up was easy, the interface clean and intuitive. \u201cI was a little nervous at first,\u201d says Geil, 25. \u201cThe idea of exchanging money via a mobile app seemed kind of sketchy.\u201d Geil now hops on Venmo several times a week. The app allows the user to hang on to a balance in her digital wallet and, at any time, cash it out to her bank account. Geil typically keeps a small amount of money in her Venmo wallet, which she uses to settle debts with friends for restaurant checks, bar tabs, gas station charges, wedding gifts, and all the other money-changing situations she finds herself in, which, as a twentysomething who hangs out with friends whenever possible, is a lot. Venmo doesn\u2019t cost her anything unless she uses a credit card, which she never does. \u201cThe only reason I even have checks now is to pay my rent,\u201d she says. Venmo also doubles, by design, as a social network. Every time a user makes a payment to a friend, he has to fill out a field summarizing what the reimbursement is for. The transaction, stripped of the specific dollar amount, is then shared with both parties\u2019 networks of friends. For example: \u201cJohn\xa0Doe paid Bob\xa0Smith\u201d for \u201cfantasy football domination.\u201d You can adjust the settings so your transactions are private, but most users don\u2019t. Part of the Venmo experience is the continuous scroll of your friends\u2019 microeconomic activity as told through droll synopsis, inside jokes, and emoji. Such is the avant-garde of home economics circa 2014. \n  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t scroll through Venmo just for kicks,\u201d Geil says. \u201cBut when I\u2019m there, making a charge or a pay request, I like to check out what\u2019s going on. People are kind of entertaining. Everyone wants to be creative and sarcastic. It can be pretty funny.\u201d Venmo\u2019s headquarters is in New York and is run by a group of self-described \u201cfun-loving oddballs.\u201d Since starting in 2009, Venmo\u2019s mash-up of personal finance and social media has proven especially compelling to college kids and urban professionals age 30 and younger. The app first took off primarily in large coastal cities such as New York and San Francisco and is now sweeping, smartphone by smartphone, across the rest of the country. Venmo executives decline to disclose how many individuals are using the product, but transaction volume on Venmo is growing fast. In the third quarter of 2014, the company says, it processed $700\xa0million in payments, up from $141\xa0million a year earlier. Along with a select handful of other apps, Venmo has inserted itself into the daily rhythms of millennials. It\u2019s a cycle that might begin with a bunch of buddies summoning a car from Uber to get to a party, cranking up some music from Spotify once they\u2019ve arrived, firing off a few goofy messages on Snapchat to lure other revelers, taking some shots on Instagram to document the mayhem, and finally, the next morning, sending some emoji-riddled payments on Venmo to settle debts and to get in one last punch line about the previous night\u2019s transgressions. The app is highly communicable. If you cover the cost of dinner for your 26-year-old cousin, good luck getting it back without signing up for Venmo. \u201cInstead of someone saying to another person, \u2018Send me some money,\u2019 they\u2019re saying, \u2018Venmo me,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Jordan McKee, a senior analyst at tech consulting firm Yankee Group. \u201cAny time your brand becomes a verb, you\u2019ve made a pretty profound impact.\u201d\xa0\xa0Futurists and currency buffs have been predicting for years that some digital gadget or other would kill off cash, credit cards, and checkbooks. That process is already far along outside the U.S. Scandinavians were using pay-by-text-message vending machines by 2000, long before most Americans had even heard of text messages. In Kenya, the mobile currency system M-Pesa is a ubiquitous tool. But after years of consumer indifference, mobile payments are about to make the leap in the U.S. from foreign-sounding novelty to inescapable fact of daily life. In a study in 2013, Forrester Research estimated that the amount of money spent by Americans via mobile payments will reach $90\xa0billion in 2017, compared with $12.8\xa0billion two years ago. Over the next several years, \u201cmobile payments will move toward the mainstream,\u201d Forrester analysts wrote. \n  Wherever consumers go, merchants are likely to follow\u2014particularly when clear-cut consumer preferences emerge. At the moment, the battle over mobile payments is far from settled, with startups, banks, credit card companies, and tech giants all fighting for a piece of the action. A recent search of AngelList, a site that tracks early-stage investment in companies, reveals that there are now at least 1,475 digital-payments-related startups. Whichever companies lure the most consumers and merchants onto their product stand to reap billions of dollars in transaction fees while also accumulating deep treasure-troves of valuable data about purchase habits. In October, Apple jumped into the arena, rolling out Apple Pay, a system that allows people to make store purchases with a fingertip reader on their iPhones. Facebook is expected to join the fray as well. On Nov.\xa017, Snapchat introduced a tool called Snapcash that allows users to send each other money through the popular ephemeral messaging app. In its current iteration, Venmo is basically a next-generation checking account. Users have the option of depositing a payment directly into their connected bank account, or save a step and just leave a balance on the app. The more people do the latter, the greater the threat Venmo is to traditional retail banking. If Venmo\u2019s expansion into store payments is as successful as it\u2019s been with peer-to-peer, companies like Square that make point-of-sale card readers have reason to worry. Venmo brings a sizable posse to this fight. In 2012, Braintree, a business in Chicago that specializes in mobile and Web payment systems for e-commerce companies, acquired Venmo for $26.2\xa0million. Last year, EBay\u2019s PayPal bought Braintree for $800\xa0million. That has put Venmo, the indie contender, under the same corporate umbrella as PayPal, the aging payments champion of the Web. In September, EBay announced it will spin off its entire payments division, including PayPal, Braintree, and Venmo, into a publicly traded company. The spinoff is expected to take place next year. \n  Company executives declined to share specific information about Venmo\u2019s financial performance. Presumably that\u2019s for the usual reason startups are mum regarding revenue: There\u2019s very little of it to discuss. In a spring earnings call, EBay\u2019s chief executive officer, John Donahoe, revealed that as of April\xa029 Venmo\u2019s peer-to-peer business didn\u2019t have any revenue. The app is free to download. It\u2019s free to receive payments on Venmo. And it\u2019s free to send money, as long as the user is paying from a bank account, debit card, or Venmo wallet. Customers who make payments via credit card accounts have to cover the 3\xa0percent transaction fee. Bill Ready, the CEO of Braintree and Venmo, says Venmo is an easy first step to get consumers accustomed to mobile payments. Much easier, he says, than training people to swipe their phones at cash registers in stores. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to get consumers comfortable with using their phone to pay,\u201d he says. \u201cThen as they become comfortable with that use, they can start to try others. This is the first step to cross the chasm.\u201d\xa0\xa0Venmo was founded by two friends, Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail, both 31. At a time when founders of tech startups are typically bestowed with a reverence once reserved for Apollo astronauts, Kortina and Magdon-Ismail remain largely unknown, and they and their minders at PayPal seem to prefer it that way. Through a spokesperson, both declined to be interviewed for this article. In September, Bank Innovation, an industry trade website, reported that the co-founders had recently stepped down from day-to-day operations at Venmo. A Venmo spokesperson denies the report. When contacted directly for clarification about his role at the company, Magdon-Ismail responded via Facebook that he continues \u201cto work alongside Bill and the team at Venmo to grow and scale the company.\u201d Kortina said via e-mail that Venmo remains his \u201cprimary professional focus, and I\u2019m actively helping develop new product strategy, figuring out how Venmo fits into the broader PayPal landscape, and working on scaling the organization.\u201d Venmo happened because of a forgotten wallet. In the spring of 2009, Magdon-Ismail traveled from Philadelphia where he was working at a startup to New York City to hang out with his college buddy Kortina. According to a history of the company that Kortina would later post on his personal website, when Magdon-Ismail arrived in New York, he realized he\u2019d left his wallet at home. By the end of the weekend, he owed Kortina $200. The process of settling up got the friends talking about how annoying it was to write and deposit checks. It would be a lot easier, they agreed, if they could just send each other money on their phones. \n  Paying for things via mobile devices was hardly a new idea. In 1998 the founders of PayPal originally envisioned the business as a secure way for PalmPilot users to send money to one another. PayPal soon shifted gears, created a system for Web payments, went public, and sold itself to EBay in 2002 for $1.5\xa0billion. Seven years later, the niche of peer-to-peer mobile payments was still largely unconquered. Magdon-Ismail and Kortina had met as freshman roommates at the University of Pennsylvania. They were both good with computers, shared an entrepreneurial streak, and went on to start a series of businesses together, including a college classified site called My Campus Post, an analytics tool (Swooge), and a music-selling platform (Philafunk). All are defunct. After Magdon-Ismail\u2019s walletless weekend in New York, the pair decided to take another shot at a startup. In the weeks that followed they cobbled together a rudimentary system that allowed them to send money back and forth between their BlackBerrys via text message, along with a brief written summary of what the payment was for. In a brainstorming session, they came up with the \u201cven\u201d from vendere, the Latin word for to sell, and \u201cmo\u201d from mobile. By the spring of 2010, they had a working prototype and raised $1\xa0million in venture capital. They quit their day jobs at technology startups and got to work on Venmo full time. The new company\u2019s tag line: \u201cIt\u2019s like your phone and your wallet had a beautiful baby.\u201d One of their key decisions, the co-founders would later explain at tech conferences, was to move the system off text messages and onto mobile apps. Along the way, they also decided to make Venmo more social by steering everybody\u2019s jokey payment summaries into public \u201cnewsfeeds.\u201d The scroll of payments, they found, increased user engagement. \n  In 2011, Venmo raised an additional $5\xa0million\u2014and soon had its first major crisis. From the beginning, all a new Venmo user had to do to get started was download the app onto a smartphone, tap in a valid credit card number, and start sending and receiving payments for free. Every time the user paid a friend, the credit card company charged Venmo a 3\xa0percent transaction fee. At first, the Venmo co-founders rationalized the fees as a loss leader while the service got off the ground. But volume soared, the company hemorrhaged money, and, as Magdon-Ismail would later recount in a 2013 speech at MIT, the situation grew dire in a hurry. For most startups, he explained, a $5\xa0million round should last two or three years. During one six-month stretch, Venmo burned through almost half of its $5\xa0million in processing fees alone. Venmo\u2019s board met and agreed to take emergency action. After some frantic reengineering, Venmo announced that users who linked their Venmo payments to their bank accounts or debit cards could continue making Venmo payments for free. Those who continued to rely on their credit cards, however, would have to cover the transaction fees. \u201cWhen we did that, all our amazing growth plummeted,\u201d Magdon-Ismail said. \u201cWe had meeting after meeting, trying to decide what we were going to do next. It was almost as if, we thought, people were just using Venmo because they wanted to get free credit card points.\u201d With cash running low, the co-founders set out to raise another round of venture capital. This time there were no takers. Toward the end of the summer of 2012, with desperation running high, the co-founders met with Ready, the CEO of Braintree. Prior to joining Braintree, Ready had invested in Venmo while working as a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. He knew the product and said the two companies would be complementary. In August, Braintree acquired Venmo. Although the $26.2\xa0million deal was a fraction of what some other social-network-flavored startups were getting\u2014Instagram got $1\xa0billion from Facebook, Twitch got $970\xa0million from Amazon.com, Tumblr got $1.1\xa0billion from Yahoo!\u2014the co-founders were relieved. \u201cBasically, Braintree saved Venmo\u2019s life,\u201d Magdon-Ismail said at MIT.\xa0\xa0On a recent visit to Venmo\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan, Magdon-Ismail and Kortina are nowhere to be seen. Casually dressed members of Venmo\u2019s growing staff mill about. The space is standard startup chic\u2014communal dining room, clusters of adjustable standing desks, and quirkily named conference rooms. Venmo\u2019s naming shtick: people whose pictures appear on U.S. currency. Sitting in the Lincoln Room, Michael Vaughan, Venmo\u2019s general manager, says full-time head count is up to about 70. For much of its administrative needs\u2014human resources, legal, finance\u2014the operation leans on its parent companies. Vaughan says Venmo\u2019s team is \u201cvery product-focused.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s money, the sensitivity is escalated dramatically vs. posting pictures and comments,\u201d he says. \u201cWe never lose sight of the fact that people are trusting us with their money. That\u2019s got to work every time exactly as expected.\u201d Venmo has mostly relied on word of mouth, peer pressure, and the occasional $5 promotional giveaways to attract users. Last year, after meeting with ad agencies and rejecting their various ideas, the co-founders conjured up an ad campaign. Over a meal at the Breslin, a restaurant popular with New York\u2019s tech community, they persuaded a newly hired software engineer, Lucas Chi, to serve as the public face of the brand. The subsequent ads, which ran in the New York City subway system, featured the engineer\u2019s expressionless, mustachioed face, accompanied by laconic phrases about his activities. \u201cLucas Wears Jeans.\u201d \u201cLucas Crosses the Street.\u201d \u201cLucas Uses Venmo.\u201d The campaign was essentially Dick and Jane reinvented for modern ironists. The subtly conveyed idea: Consumers should feel no more hesitant about making payments over their smartphones than toddlers should feel hesitant about bouncing a ball. Although the campaign was a hit, inspiring much nattering and meme making on social media, Vaughan says the company is done advertising. \u201cWe like the organic way that Venmo is growing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we\u2019re sticking with for\xa0now.\u201d \n  Unlike Snapchat, Instagram, and pretty much every other fast-growing mobile app these days that builds up a huge audience before getting much revenue, Venmo has no plans to introduce ads into its social stream. \u201cPeople ask us about that all the time,\u201d says Ready. \u201cWe have a great avenue to monetization without having to do advertising, which is very different than a lot of other social apps.\u201d The way Venmo will make its money, Ready explains, is not by charging consumers for transactions but by charging merchants. For years, Braintree has been focused on building a system designed to make it easier for new startups to accept and process mobile and Web payments from customers. The company has scooped up as paying clients many of the fast-growing, app-driven startups in the sharing economy, including Airbnb, Uber, and TaskRabbit. Braintree handles transactions in whatever way consumers choose to pay, whether it\u2019s credit cards, Bitcoin, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Wallet, or Venmo. \u201cOur role is to give developers and merchants really easy access to all the payment tools that are going to be relevant and useful to them,\u201d Ready says. \u201cThe mobile checkout is going to have multiple options. There won\u2019t be a hundred of these things. Every tech company is going to want to work with the few that matter.\u201d In theory, the more people who use Venmo, the more incentive merchants will have to accept it at checkout. In August, Braintree rolled out a payment option for merchants called One Touch, which allows people shopping on their smartphones to pay participating merchants directly from a Venmo or PayPal wallet without having to reenter any information. \u201cWallets have existed on the Internet for almost 15\xa0years,\u201d Ready says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve always believed that wallets would be much more important in the mobile world, because people aren\u2019t going to be happy rekeying their information over and over again.\u201d \n  Rytis Vitkauskas is the founder and CEO of YPlan, a startup that allows smartphone users in various cities\u2014including London, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and New York\u2014to peruse a curated list of events going on each evening and to buy tickets at the last minute. YPlan recently added One Touch as a payment option for its customers. Vitkauskas says he likes One Touch because it significantly decreases the amount of effort needed for customers to check out, which, in turn, increases the likelihood that they\u2019ll complete a purchase. It\u2019s also appealing, he says, because among mobile app users, Venmo is already a trusted brand, which can make first-time users feel more at ease in a new mobile environment. \u201cWe launched One Touch two or three weeks ago, so it\u2019s still early days,\u201d Vitkauskas says. \u201cEven so, we\u2019ve seen strong customer uptake.\u201d Merchants such as YPlan pay a transaction fee every time a Venmo user completes a purchase using One Touch. The more money being spent over smartphones, the more Venmo stands to benefit, particularly if it can stick to the consumer as he hops around from app to app on his smartphone. \u201cI don\u2019t think Braintree sees a future of charging for peer-to-peer payments,\u201d says analyst McKee of Yankee Group. The real value, he says, is getting the debit cards on file to have leverage with merchants. Eric Jackson, a former PayPal executive who played a crucial role in the company\u2019s early days, says Venmo\u2019s growing popularity among mobile consumers should be \u201chugely valuable\u201d to PayPal down the road. \u201cIt\u2019s good they fell into PayPal\u2019s lap,\u201d says Jackson, who penned the book The PayPal Wars and is now the co-founder and CEO of CapLinked, a financial tech startup in Southern California. \u201cI don\u2019t think PayPal could have done this. They\u2019ve struggled in terms of innovation. They\u2019re trying to find a way to regain that mojo, which is a big reason for the spinoff.\u201d The key for PayPal, Jackson says, is to avoid doing to Venmo what EBay did to PayPal: impose its culture and effectively chase away talent. \u201cProduct independence is key,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way they\u2019ve been doing it is working. So why change it? I would set the expectation early on during the spinoff process that Venmo is sacrosanct. Keep them squirreled away.\u201d Anuj Nayar, senior director of global initiative at PayPal, says EBay\u2019s acquisition of PayPal was one of the most successful in Silicon Valley history. \u201cWe grew at an incredible rate after that in a way that PayPal as an independent company wouldn\u2019t have been able to,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would we change something that is doing so well and is loved so much by its customers?\u201d \n  In June, during a panel discussion at the Northside Festival, an innovation conference in Brooklyn, N.Y., Venmo\u2019s Magdon-Ismail gave his assessment of how the mobile payments field is shaking out. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two competitors,\u201d he said. \u201cFacebook and\xa0cash.\u201d A few days earlier, Facebook had hired away PayPal\u2019s then president, David Marcus, to run Facebook\u2019s Messenger unit. The move touched off widespread speculation that Facebook will eventually jump into peer-to-peer payments. Ready says he\u2019s not losing sleep over that prospect. \u201cEven in the short life of Venmo, there have already been a few new competitors where people said, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s a Venmo killer,\u2019\u200a\u201d he says. \u201cNot only did we survive, but we\u2019re growing faster than ever.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/felixgillette', 'name': u'Felix Gillette', 'twitterhandle': u'felixgillette'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-20/mobile-payment-startup-venmo-is-killing-cash', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 11, 21, 11, 32, 45, 511000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Cash Is for Losers!'}, {'articleText': u'   An island in Micronesia. A gold mine in Canada\u2019s Yukon Territory. Tickets to the 2014 Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show in London. Those are just a few of the assets on offer at BitPremier, a website targeting bitcoin holders looking to unload some of their digital hoard. The number of listings on BitPremier took off when the price of a single bitcoin -- the controversial currency that exists only in cyberspace -- skyrocketed to $1,137 at the end of November 2013 from $12 at the start of the year. After regulatory crackdowns around the world, the value of bitcoins dropped by more than half. However, even with the price fall, there are those sitting on bundles of bitcoins with very few ways to spend them. Others are finding it hard to obtain large quantities of bitcoins without moving the price in the still-nascent market. Bringing the two groups together is BitPremier, Bloomberg Pursuits will report in its Autumn 2014 issue. The site is the brainchild of 41-year-old Alan Silbert, whose day job is vice president of biotechnology lending at General Electric Capital Corp. in Washington. Silbert started buying bitcoins in February 2013, when the price was about $22, at the urging of his younger brother Barry, chairman of SecondMarket Inc., a New York\u2013based brokerage specializing in hard-to-trade assets. The brothers realized there was nothing in the bitcoin universe dealing in luxury goods and services and so established BitPremier in May 2013. \u201cAt that point, you could only use bitcoins to buy T-shirts, coffee mugs and alpaca socks,\u201d Alan says. \u201cWe saw a big void in the market that we wanted to fill. If you want to diversify into bitcoins, we\u2019re the place to do it.\u201d Indeed, BitPremier helped broker one of the biggest transactions ever conducted in bitcoins: the February sale of a two-bedroom villa with a pool in Seminyak, Bali, for $650,000, or about 950 bitcoins. (Items are listed in dollars or euros and converted into bitcoins every 60 seconds.) The seller, German real estate developer Ronny Tome, knew little about bitcoins until the stepson of his business partner suggested he use BitPremier to market his firm\u2019s collection of properties. The listing was up on BitPremier for just a week before the eventual buyer, based in Texas, approached Tome. While it took four months to finalize the deal, the payment in bitcoins was done in minutes, as opposed to the days it would have taken to transfer money between banks. After BitPremier took its customary 5 percent commission, Tome sold half his bitcoins to finance the construction of other properties and kept the rest for himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a gamble,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it looks like it could be an attractive investment.\u201d One of the challenges confronting Alan Silbert is the tendency of people to hoard bitcoins in the hope the price will spike again. \u201cPeople who hold enough bitcoins to make them a potential buyer have drunk the Kool-Aid, and they\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u201d he says. \u201cThe challenge for me is getting them to part with them.\u201d That has meant some sellers have received nary a nibble. One of the first to use BitPremier was Matthew Mellon, scion of the Mellon banking family, who listed a photo collage titled Orphaned Cheetah Cubs by renowned wildlife photographer Peter Beard for $1.1 million, or 2,319 bitcoins, in the summer of 2013. A year later, he hadn\u2019t received a single inquiry. \u201cI was betting people who got into bitcoins early would say, \u2018I have a lot of bitcoins right now, and I want to spend them,\u2019\u201d Mellon says. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s also possible that your typical bitcoin investor is not an avid art collector. Perhaps they\u2019d rather have a Porsche or a Ferrari or a condo in Hong Kong than a cool photograph.\u201d Meanwhile, some sellers are waiting patiently for bitcoin prices to spike again to spur interest. Ryan Weaver, a software developer and early bitcoin enthusiast based in Indonesia, for example, is eager to part with a private island off Pohnpei in Micronesia for $459,000, or 968 bitcoins. Weaver says he received some interest when bitcoin prices surged above $1,000, only to have inquiries drop off again when the price plummeted. He nevertheless remains hopeful. \u201cSeasoned bitcoiners have learned to hold when prices slip and spend when it\u2019s off like a rocket ship,\u201d he says. Those who think bitcoins are fool\u2019s gold should know that they can be used to buy the real thing. Tim Coles, a 54-year-old Canadian, is currently shopping his Dawson City, Yukon, gold mine on BitPremier for $2 million, or 4,217 bitcoins, in a bid to cash out after 35 years in the business. Coles says he has sent out detailed information on the mine to four potential buyers who have subsequently signed nondisclosure agreements. \u201cI\u2019d just like a new challenge,\u201d Coles says. His next potential venture? \u201cI\u2019m thinking about going into bitcoin mining,\u201d he says, referring to the process of using complicated computer algorithms to mint new bitcoins. \u201cIt seems like it could be quite lucrative.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-18/how-to-buy-islands-gold-mines-and-villas-with-bitcoin', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 18, 4, 0, 1, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'How to Buy Islands, Gold Mines and Villas With Bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u'  Xapo Ltd., a bitcoin startup, said former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc.

Representatives of tech companies, retailers, banks and payment networks gather at the four-day Money20/20 conference. Organizers have predicted it will draw more than 7,000 attendees, including hundreds of chief executive officers.

The threshold now being discussed, which is 50 percent higher than a limit proposed late last year by the European Banking Authority, has yet to be signed off on by all parties, Karsten Beltoft, head of the Mortgage Bankers\u2019 Federation, said by phone yesterday. The European Commission is due to announce its decision by next month. The government of Denmark, home to the world\u2019s largest covered bond market per capita, has signaled it may still push to allow banks to use the securities for more than 60 percent of their liquid buffers. Lenders in the Nordic nation rely on mortgage-backed covered bonds for about 70 percent of their liquidity needs.

China Regulator Warns Lenders Against Misuse of Personal Loans China\u2019s banking regulator asked lenders in the nation\u2019s capital to tighten risk management over personal loans after it found people were using the money to buy homes and stocks. Some Beijing-based lenders have approved large amounts of borrowings with maturities that extend too long for typical personal loans, according to a notice posted yesterday on the website of the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Loans for individuals were being used for stock investments and home purchases, according to the notice dated April 28, which was issued by the CBRC\u2019s Beijing office. Banks should cap personal loans at 1 million yuan ($160,604), with terms of no more than 10 years, the regulator said in the notice. China Bitcoin Exchanges Pull Out of Conference After PBOC Signal Several of China\u2019s largest bitcoin exchanges pulled out of a May 10 global conference in Beijing after China\u2019s central bank signaled further curbs on speculative trading of the virtual currency. BTC China Co. said it and four other bitcoin trading platforms agreed to adopt stricter practices such as halting margin trading and short selling. They also agreed to not participate in bitcoin marketing conferences and gatherings, according to a statement posted yesterday on the website of BTC China, the oldest of the nation\u2019s bitcoin operators. The People\u2019s Bank of China began a crackdown on bitcoin in December. A spokesman for the PBOC\u2019s media relations department declined to comment yesterday. SEC Finds Illegal or Bogus Fees in Majority of Buyout Firms U.S. regulators found illegal collections of fees or severe compliance shortfalls in more than half of the private-equity firms it has examined since 2012, a signal the industry could face tougher oversight or sanctions. \u201cBy far, the most common observation our examiners have made when examining private-equity firms has to do with the adviser\u2019s collection of fees and allocation of expenses,\u201d Drew Bowden, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s office of compliance inspections and examinations, said yesterday in a speech at the Private Fund Compliance Forum in New York. The SEC\u2019s review of the $3.5 trillion private-equity industry started after passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Private-fund managers also were required to file confidential reports. The agency, which created a special unit of examiners to inspect firms with more than $150 million in assets, has reviewed more than 150 private-equity firms since October 2012. The SEC intends to have examined 275 of the firms by year-end, Bowden said. Banks in U.S. Eased Commercial Loan Policies, Fed Says Banks in the U.S. eased policies for loans to businesses including real estate companies during the first quarter amid stronger demand for credit, according to a Federal Reserve survey. For households, banks reported easier standards on consumer credit card and auto loans, the Fed said yesterday in Washington in its quarterly survey of senior loan officers. The central bank surveyed 74 domestic banks and 23 U.S. units of foreign banks from April 1-15. All domestic banks that reported easing standards or terms on commercial and industrial loans cited more competition from other banks and non-bank lenders as \u201can important reason for having done so,\u201d the Fed said. A smaller number of banks attributed easing to a more favorable economic outlook.

The inspector general\u2019s staff is urging the Postal Service to expand into financial services as part of a broader strategy to end seven straight years of losses. That may include turning local post offices into brokers for Bitcoin, a five-year-old anonymous network for issuing and moving money across the Internet. \u201cThe post office might help address two major shortcomings that virtual currencies have today: lack of trust and lack of access,\u201d Paola Piscioneri, a director of international research at the Postal Service\u2019s OIG, said in an interview. \u201cToday, when you transact with a virtual currency you don\u2019t know who is on the other side.\u201d Becoming a Bitcoin intermediary means the Postal Service would have to take a business model that dates back to the 1770s and integrate it with a proto-currency that only exists on spreadsheets on the Internet. Then it would have to determine if enough of its customers would trade in Bitcoins when they\u2019re more accustomed to using post offices to buy money orders and stamps and send packages. \u201cI consider potential revenue to be very limited at the moment as the user base is still rather low\u201d for Bitcoin, Christian Jaag, a managing partner at Zurich-based Swiss Economics, said in an e-mail. \u201cAlso, regulatory risk is probably prohibitive for an agency or firm that is operating in a politically sensitive environment as the Postal Service.\u201d Joseph Corbett, the service\u2019s chief financial officer, said the agency will stay on the sidelines for now and see if the Bitcoin market becomes more stable and transparent. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t have any current plans to accept Bitcoins or to invest or otherwise be involved with the Bitcoin market, primarily due to the volatility,\u201d Corbett said on an conference call today to discuss fiscal first-quarter earnings. \u201cAlso, lack of transparency in that market is something that is bothersome.\u201d Bitcoin was introduced around 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers who have never been positively identified. While Bitcoin.org estimates the currency had a market value of about $10.6 billion in mid-January, there is no central issuing authority, with only a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions. There\u2019s also the question of how to generate sustainable revenue from a volatile currency that has few fees, undetermined legal status and is still a minor presence in a multi-trillion dollar payment industry dominated by companies like Visa Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. While the inspector general\u2019s suggestions on financial services and Bitcoin are interesting ideas, the agency will stick to it\u2019s main business for now, Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe said today. \u201cAs we\u2019ve stated publicly before, we feel from the postal perspective our future lies in our core, and our core is delivery,\u201d he said on the conference call. The Postal Service today said it lost $354 million loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31, citing \u201cthe persistent decline of higher-margin first-class mail, stifling legal mandates, and its inflexible business and governance models.\u201d Since 2006, the Postal Service has reported about $46 billion in total net losses as Internet-based communications replaced mail volume, and United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. grabbed bigger shares of the package-delivery business. Efforts by the Postal Service to close its budget gap have been hamstrung by the U.S. Congress, which must approve any major changes to the business model despite the service getting less than 1 percent of its revenue from taxpayers. The agency can\u2019t increase mailing prices by more than the inflation rate without regulatory blessing and is required to prepay future costs of retirees\u2019 healthcare. Researchers at the inspector general\u2019s office said they believe the Postal Service could move into virtual currency without Congress\u2019s approval because it would be considered \u201cancillary\u201d to the agency\u2019s current financial services authority. Post offices already issue 70 percent of domestic money orders. The service offers prepaid debit cards in the U.S. and an electronic money transfer service to nine Latin American countries called Dinero Seguro, which means secure money. The Postal Service has an opening to expand into non-bank financial products to the underserved, taking a cue from the success of other postal agencies around the world, the inspector general\u2019s office said in a January report. Financial services have been a greater source of new revenue than parcel delivery and logistics, making up 15 percent of revenue for industrialized countries\u2019 postal organizations in 2012, according to the report. The inspector general\u2019s office hosted an online forum Jan. 29 with the Universal Postal Union, which represents 192 member countries, as well as representatives from the World Bank, the Bitcoin Foundation, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The researchers said they plan to explore options such as putting Bitcoin ATMs in some post offices or offering electronic wallets where people could store their Bitcoin. While agency wouldn\u2019t be involved in the technical side of Bitcoin, post offices could be a brick-and-mortar outlet for the authentication or the redemption of virtual currencies. The Postal Service has about 36,000 retail outlets on U.S. territory, 38 percent of them in zip codes that have no bank branches, according to Piscioneri. The Bitcoin Foundation said those could be valuable new customers. \u201cIt could be an on-ramp to innovative financial services for traditionally unbanked populations,\u201d Jinyoung Lee Englund, a spokesman for the Bitcoin Foundation, said in an e-mail.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-07/could-bitcoin-be-answer-for-profit-starved-post-office-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 7, 18, 11, 36, 737000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Could Bitcoin Be Answer for Profit-Starved Post Office?'}, {'articleText': u'  They can\u2019t stop talking about Apple Pay.

The value of such transactions made via mobile devices worldwide could jump by almost 40 percent this year to $507 billion, according to Juniper Research. Mobile devices will account for about 26 percent of Americans\u2019 spending online in 2014, according to the research firm Mercator Advisory Group; by 2025 it\u2019ll be 61 percent. Some banks, carriers and merchants are developing their own payment apps amid concern that Apple will stand between them and their customers. Companies including CVS Health Corp. have made it impossible for customers to use Apple Pay. Google Inc. and Softcard, a joint venture of three wireless carriers, have sunk millions into their efforts over the years.

The mystery may finally have been solved. QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain The person who unleashed the virtual currency anonymously in 2009 is probably a 44-year-old academic living in suburban Sydney, according to Wired magazine. Citing e-mails, deleted blog posts and documents, Wired identified Craig Steven Wright as the\xa0likely developer of the original bitcoin software under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Gizmodo also identified Wright, along with his late friend Dave Kleiman, as being behind the currency. Wright\u2019s social-media profile suggests a man with an enthusiasm for virtual currency and computing. In addition to numerous college degrees and a stint as a chef, his LinkedIn profile lists him as the chief executive officer of DeMorgan Ltd., which has researched bitcoin, proposed a bank for the currency, and offers wallet and exchange services. After years of mystery and failed efforts to unmask Nakamoto, many in the bitcoin community remain skeptical about Wright, who participated in a Las Vegas bitcoin event just weeks ago via videoconference. \u201cIf the real Satoshi does appear, his opinion would be difficult to ignore,\u201d said Yuzo Kano, who quit Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to open bitcoin exchange BitFlyer Inc. in 2014.\xa0\u201cIt\u2019s possible that Mr. Wright was one of the people involved in the original bitcoin and there are in fact multiple Satoshis.\u201d Bitcoin gained an early reputation as a tool for selling drugs and laundering money. The currency\u2019s libertarian roots, with no central issuing authority and a public ledger to verify transactions, has become more mainstream with its adoption by merchants around the world. Its underlying technology has also drawn interest from banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. Wired\u2019s evidence for naming Wright as the currency\u2019s creator includes 2008 blog posts discussing bitcoin, along with e-mails, transcripts and accounting forms that corroborate the link. The real Nakamoto proposed bitcoin that same year before the software was rolled out in early 2009. Wired also cited a 2014 administrator\u2019s report into Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Pty., which indicated the e-payment software firm was backed by A$30 million ($22 million) of bitcoins owned by its managing director Wright. Amid the speculation, bitcoin climbed on Wednesday to hit its highest levels since early November. The reports mentioned a legal arrangement that keeps a very large chunk of 1.1 million bitcoins locked up in a trust until 2020. That would remove the risk of a big supply hitting the market anytime soon and driving down the price. Wired reported that whoever is the real Nakamoto \u201cappears to control a stash of bitcoins easily worth a nine-figure fortune.\u201d If that person is Wright, he doesn\u2019t appear to have been spending it on an opulent lifestyle. His modest home in the Sydney suburb of Gordon lies in a quiet\xa0tree-lined street about 13\xa0kilometers from Sydney\u2019s central business district. Police raided the house on Wednesday as they assisted an investigation by the Australian Taxation Office. The raid was unrelated to media reports about Wright\u2019s possible involvement in bitcoin, the police said. Wright\u2019s LinkedIn profile listed time working for ASX Ltd., operator of Australia\u2019s biggest stock exchange, as well as OzEmail, one of the country\u2019s first Internet service providers. Under education, it shows multiple Master\u2019s degrees, a PhD in computer science and a doctorate in theology. A message sent to the profile wasn\u2019t returned and information from the profile such as work history and education has been removed since Wired\u2019s report. The same person is listed as a lecturer at Charles Sturt University, specializing in encryption, cybercrime and wireless hacking. The university\u2019s media office didn\u2019t provide a phone number for\xa0Wright\u2019s office and e-mails sent to his university address bounced back. A woman who answered the phone at DeMorgan on Thursday said neither Wright nor Ramona Watts, reported by Gizmodo to be his wife, were at the office and the company wasn\u2019t interested in talking to anyone. Then she hung up. Watts didn\u2019t return messages left on a mobile-phone number that was listed as hers on the company website. While the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has occupied some bitcoin fans, others such as Gregory Maxwell said knowing who started the currency doesn\u2019t matter. Maxwell, an early contributor to bitcoin protocol on software collaboration site GitHub, has doubts about some of the evidence cited by the publications in naming Wright. \u201cI\u2019ve reviewed some of the evidence being used, and much of it is clearly fabricated,\u201d Maxwell,\xa0who is also chief technology officer at cryptocurrency innovation firm Blockstream, said by e-mail. \u201cIt is unlikely that the evidence which cannot yet be shown to be true or false has merit.\u201d This is not the first time a publication claimed to have found the elusive inventor. The New York Times and New Yorker magazine have both tried to find whomever is behind the pseudonym. In a cover story last year, Newsweek identified the real Satoshi Nakamoto as a California physicist, who denied the report. Some fans would prefer Nakamoto\u2019s true identity remain an enigma. \u201cThe cloud of mystique surrounding bitcoin\u2019s creation makes it all the more interesting,\u201d Alex Waters, CEO of bitcoin payment processor Coin.co, said by e-mail. \u201cThat being said, I think the technology stands on its own as a product of great\xa0human achievement regardless of who held the pen to the white paper.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/pashakun', 'name': u'Pavel Alpeyev', 'twitterhandle': u'pashakun'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-10/bitcoin-s-creator-reportedly-living-suburban-life-in-australia', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 10, 1, 59, 33, 464000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Bitcoin's Creator Reportedly Living Suburban Life in Australia"}, {'articleText': u'  Singapore prosecuted a record number of money laundering cases and seized more than S$115 million ($92 million) of suspected criminal proceeds in 2013 as more overseas offenders seek out bank accounts in the city. \u201cSingapore\u2019s openness as an international transport hub and financial center exposes it to cross-border money-laundering and terrorist financing risks,\u201d Tan Boon Gin, director of the Commercial Affairs Department, said in the agency\u2019s annual report posted on its website. \u201cWe are seeing a trend of overseas criminals seeking to launder money through Singapore bank accounts.\u201d The city\u2019s white-collar police has tripled its financial investigation resources with an increase in suspicious transaction reports and aid requests from overseas enforcement agencies.

TradeHill Inc., the San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange, plans to open its first Latin American office in Argentina after demand surged the most in the region, founder Jered Kenna said in an interview on April 12. Rodolfo Andragnes, an agent for bitcoin buyers and sellers who organizes bi-monthly meetings for enthusiasts in Buenos Aires, says while local trading of the unregulated currency still equals less than 0.1 percent of the almost $1 billion of the nation\u2019s foreign-exchange transactions on a weekly basis, it has more than doubled since February. Argentines are trying to preserve their savings in everything from bitcoins to cars to skirt President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s restrictions on buying dollars, with the peso forecast to weaken the most of any currency in the world this year and local-currency bonds suffering the worst returns in Latin America. While the price of bitcoins plunged to $79 from a high of $234 in the past week and caused Mt. Gox exchange to halt trading on April 11, the sixfold increase this year is enticing Argentines whose savings have been decimated by inflation rising at 25 percent annually. \u201cSome Argentines are willing to take very risky investments and bet on this thing which feels almost like a Ponzi scheme because they feel their options locally are even more dangerous,\u201d Claudio Loser, a former director at the International Monetary Fund, who now heads the Centennial Group Latin America research company, said in a telephone interview from Washington. \u201cThey don\u2019t see an easier way to save money.\u201d Bitcoin is a virtual currency created four years ago by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto that doesn\u2019t have a central authority in charge of money supply, a central clearing house or financial institutions involved in the transactions because users perform all these tasks themselves. Its supply grows as they\u2019re \u201cmined\u201d by computers that solve difficult cryptographic problems to verify transactions. As more bitcoins are created, the problems\u2019 difficulty increases. There are a little more than 11 million Bitcoins in existence. The software that governs the network will allow no more than 21 million coins to be created. In an attempt to curb capital flight, Fernandez in July banned Argentines from buying dollars except for travel and the country\u2019s tax agency must approve any foreign exchange purchase. On March 18, the government raised the tax on credit and debit card purchases abroad to 20 percent. Press officials at the Economy Ministry didn\u2019t respond to a telephone call seeking comment on the use of bitcoins to skirt currency controls. The government also limited trading in foreign-company depositary receipts and investment in assets abroad by restricting the amount mutual funds can hold and making them value the assets with the official exchange rate, instead of the higher parallel rate. Bitcoins are more attractive for Argentines than peers in the region as they offer a way of transferring money outside of the country and obtaining foreign currency abroad, according to TradeHill\u2019s Kenna. \u201cArgentina possibly has the most demand I\u2019ve seen out of Latin America for Bitcoins,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from San Francisco. \u201cIt provides a way to move money out of the country and avoid capital controls.\u201d Kenna is seeking to partner with a local bank to open an exchange in the country. Most investment options in Argentina don\u2019t compensate for inflation. The rate banks pay for 30-day deposits of more than 1 million pesos was at 15.44 percent on April 12. The country\u2019s benchmark peso bonds due 2018 yield 8.7 percent and yields for dollar bonds traded locally in pesos are negative as investors are willing to lose money to get dollars by holding the notes to maturity. Argentine local-currency bonds, which are linked to the official inflation rate of 10.6 percent, lost 2.2 percent this year, compared with average gains of 2.8 percent for similar notes in Latin America, according to Barclays Plc. indexes. The extra yield investors demand to own Argentine bonds instead of Treasuries narrowed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1,156 basis points at 3:23 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s EMBI Global index. Julian Garrone, founder of bitcoin forum litebitcoin.com.ar, said he mined bitcoins two years ago until the program exceeded his computer\u2019s capacity and is now seeking to buy more of the virtual currency. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a bubble, I think it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d Garrone, 28, said in a telephone interview from Mar del Plata, Argentina. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t depend on any government or bank and that\u2019s very valuable.\u201d Bitcoins can be used to buy and sell goods from refrigerators to property in Argentina through MercadoLibre.com, a Latin American online-auction site partly owned by EBay Inc. Online exchanges offer a market for bitcoins to be traded for dollars, euros, yen and other currencies. The peso price of the virtual currency is calculated by using the dollar rate on Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, adding a commission of about 5 percent, and multiplying it by the black market rate, which was 8.4 per dollar yesterday, said Andragnes, who also runs an education company called Cesyt that accepts bitcoins as payment. \u201cPeople could just go and buy dollars in the black market but there\u2019s an additional interest for bitcoins,\u201d he said in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires. \u201cArgentines distrust banks after their accounts were frozen for the 2001 crisis and a lot of them think that could happen again.\u201d In 2001, Argentina restricted access to bank accounts, a measure dubbed the \u201ccorralito,\u201d as the country defaulted on $95 billion of debt. Early the next year, it ended the peso\u2019s decade-long one-to-one peg with the U.S. currency and converted dollar savings into pesos. Buying or selling dollars in the black market has been considered an act of terrorism since December 2011 and carries prison sentence of as long as eight years. The parallel rate is at a record 63 percent higher than the official rate. The official peso fell 0.1 percent to 5.1570 per dollar. The currency is forecast to weaken 11 percent to 5.8 by year end, according to 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, the biggest drop in the world. The value of Bitcoins soared from $27 to $82 in March, when European finance officials approved an unprecedented tax on bank deposits in Cyprus. While the plan didn\u2019t go through, it led to speculation that other bank deposits might be taxed. The rising price drew increased media attention, which sparked further price gains, according to Andragnes. The growing market for bitcoins, called \u201cgold for nerds\u201d by Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, follows a surge in demand for the precious metal in Argentina, as investors also view it as a way to hedge against inflation. Banco de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s only gold trader, is talking with mining companies to buy the metal directly as demand exhausts its supply. Trading was halted on Mt. Gox for 12 hours on April 11 to let the market \u201ccool down\u201d after a plunge in price, the company said in a statement, citing an increase in trading volume. Other exchanges, including TradeHill, remained open. The record $50,000 of bitcoins traded last week in Argentina is still equal to less than 0.1 percent of the $964 million in foreign exchange traded in the country\u2019s Open Electronic Market, or Mae, in that period. \u201cThis is attractive in Argentina because it\u2019s a currency that escapes the government\u2019s radar,\u201d Loser said. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s a risky experiment that few people are trying out. The solution needs to come from government policies to seriously address inflation.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-16/bitcoin-dreams-endure-to-savers-crushed-by-cpi-argentina-credit', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 4, 16, 19, 26, 2, 369000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Dreams Endure to Savers Crushed by CPI: Argentina Credit'}, {'articleText': u'  Matt Tuzzolo, who used to split restaurant bills by sending money via PayPal, now wields his iPhone to pay his fellow diners -- in Bitcoins. \u201cIt\u2019s more convenient than PayPal,\u201d said Tuzzolo, a software developer in Portland, Oregon, who uses the Gliph mobile application to transfer digital money on the go. \u201cIt\u2019s as easy as sending a text.\u201d Gliph Inc., which has more than 25,000 users, has raised more than $350,000 from venture capitalists including Tim Draper, who has backed such companies as Skype and Tesla Motors Inc. It\u2019s one of hundreds of Bitcoin-related programs available from Google Inc. and Apple Inc. app stores. The mini-boom in Bitcoin software for smartphones is making it easier for consumers to use the virtual currency in place of cash for quick transactions, such as paying for food or splitting a bill. The widening appeal of the digital money is also fueling a rally that has lifted Bitcoins to record levels, surpassing $1,000 apiece last week. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s success hinges on how well it\u2019s adopted and configured for mobile,\u201d said Richard Crone, chief executive officer of payment-researcher Crone Consulting LLC. \u201cThey are very dependent on mobile actually scaling.\u201d Since Bitcoins exist as software, apps on wireless devices are an efficient way to transfer money. While physical coins representing Bitcoins are in circulation, they either store software or are used as a proxy for a digital transaction. The emerging category of mobile Bitcoin apps is aimed at making it easier for people to employ the programs for everyday tasks, such as storing digital money in virtual wallets, paying other people and stores for goods and services, and exchanging Bitcoins for dollars and other currencies. \u201cIt has to be there, in person, when you have to spend it,\u201d Rob Banagale, Gliph\u2019s CEO, said in an interview. While mobile apps are fostering wider use of Bitcoins, other challenges include security, regulation and app-store approvals. China\u2019s central bank today barred financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions. The People\u2019s Bank of China said Bitcoin isn\u2019t a currency with \u201creal meaning\u201d and doesn\u2019t have the same legal status. The public is free to participate in Internet transactions provided they take on the risk themselves, the central bank said. The virtual currency dropped more than 20 percent to below $1,000 on the Bitstamp online exchange. Bitcoin has since bounced back to $1,022 at 1:30 p.m. in New York. Virtual currencies and mobile payments are two areas regulators will scrutinize for potential legal violations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is monitoring the growing mobile-payments industry as part of its brief to police retail financial markets. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday that Bitcoin prices were unsustainably high. \u201cIt\u2019s a bubble,\u201d Greenspan said in a Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cYou have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is.\u201d Banagale and other Bitcoin enthusiasts will be discussing such issues at a conference in Las Vegas next week. To provide some security, Asedik Inc., a San Francisco-based Bitcoin payment service, limits customers to three transactions a month. \u201cWe want to make sure mobile-phone users are protected,\u201d Asedik CEO Matthew Martin said in an interview. \u201cWe never want to get into a scenario where someone stole your phone and made purchases.\u201d Asedik\u2019s user base is growing at 40 percent every month, he said, declining to disclose total user numbers. Bitcoin\u2019s shift to mobile is happening even though Apple has rejected many Bitcoin payment apps, especially those that exchange Bitcoins for dollars and other currencies, developers said. Rejected developers are instead flocking to Android-based devices, according to Pavel Nikitenko, developer of an app called BitcoinViewer that lets users track how many Bitcoins they have left in their wallet. Apple and Google prohibit apps involved in any illegal activities, according to their software-developer policies. Natalie Kerris, a spokeswoman for Apple, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Christopher Katsaros, a spokesman for Google, declined to comment. There are about 250 applications in the Google Play store offering services ranging from Bitcoin money transfers to exchange tracking. On Apple\u2019s iTunes, there are almost 100 apps offering everything from mining monitoring -- a way to see how fast your computers are generating Bitcoins -- to virtual mobile courses on Bitcoin. Bitcoins emerged in 2008, designed by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity remains unknown. The currency isn\u2019t regulated by any government or central bank. New Bitcoins can only be created by solving complex problems embedded in the currency, keeping total growth limited. While Bitcoins could be used for nefarious purposes, they can also be a \u201clegal means of exchange,\u201d and policies need to be crafted to regulate their use, the U.S. Justice Department said at a U.S. Senate committee hearing last month. The growth in mobile Bitcoin apps is also being driven by the spreading ubiquity of mobile devices. Global shipments of mobile phones and tablets will exceed personal-computer shipments this year by more than six times, according to researcher Gartner Inc. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the big game, on mobile,\u201d Nicolas Cary, CEO of mobile Bitcoin app provider Blockchain.info, said in an interview. The market for mobile payments is projected to be $235.4 billion in total transaction value in 2013, up 44 percent from the prior year, according to Gartner. Because Bitcoins can lower or eliminate money-transfer and other banking fees, the digital currency could potentially compete with EBay Inc.\u2019s PayPal, Visa Inc., Google and others offering mobile payments. Jennifer Hakes, a spokeswoman for PayPal, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.

It\u2019s one of hundreds of Bitcoin-related programs available from Google Inc. and Apple Inc. app stores. The mini-boom in Bitcoin software for smartphones is making it easier for consumers to use the virtual currency in place of cash for quick transactions, such as paying for food or splitting a bill. The widening appeal of the digital money is also fueling a rally that has lifted Bitcoins to record levels, surpassing $1,000 apiece last week. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s success hinges on how well it\u2019s adopted and configured for mobile,\u201d said Richard Crone, chief executive officer of payment-researcher Crone Consulting LLC. \u201cThey are very dependent on mobile actually scaling.\u201d Since Bitcoins exist as software, apps on wireless devices are an efficient way to transfer money. While physical coins representing Bitcoins are in circulation, they either store software or are used as a proxy for a digital transaction. The emerging category of mobile Bitcoin apps is aimed at making it easier for people to employ the programs for everyday tasks, such as storing digital money in virtual wallets, paying other people and stores for goods and services, and exchanging Bitcoins for dollars and other currencies. \u201cIt has to be there, in person, when you have to spend it,\u201d Rob Banagale, Gliph\u2019s CEO, said in an interview. While mobile apps are fostering wider use of Bitcoins, other challenges include security, regulation and app-store approvals. China\u2019s central bank today barred financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions. The People\u2019s Bank of China said Bitcoin isn\u2019t a currency with \u201creal meaning\u201d and doesn\u2019t have the same legal status. The public is free to participate in Internet transactions provided they take on the risk themselves, the central bank said. The virtual currency dropped more than 20 percent to below $1,000 on the Bitstamp online exchange. Bitcoin has since bounced back to $1,022 at 1:30 p.m. in New York. Virtual currencies and mobile payments are two areas regulators will scrutinize for potential legal violations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is monitoring the growing mobile-payments industry as part of its brief to police retail financial markets. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday that Bitcoin prices were unsustainably high. \u201cIt\u2019s a bubble,\u201d Greenspan said in a Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cYou have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is.\u201d Banagale and other Bitcoin enthusiasts will be discussing such issues at a conference in Las Vegas next week. To provide some security, Asedik Inc., a San Francisco-based Bitcoin payment service, limits customers to three transactions a month. \u201cWe want to make sure mobile-phone users are protected,\u201d Asedik CEO Matthew Martin said in an interview. \u201cWe never want to get into a scenario where someone stole your phone and made purchases.\u201d Asedik\u2019s user base is growing at 40 percent every month, he said, declining to disclose total user numbers. Bitcoin\u2019s shift to mobile is happening even though Apple has rejected many Bitcoin payment apps, especially those that exchange Bitcoins for dollars and other currencies, developers said. Rejected developers are instead flocking to Android-based devices, according to Pavel Nikitenko, developer of an app called BitcoinViewer that lets users track how many Bitcoins they have left in their wallet. Apple and Google prohibit apps involved in any illegal activities, according to their software-developer policies. Natalie Kerris, a spokeswoman for Apple, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Christopher Katsaros, a spokesman for Google, declined to comment. There are about 250 applications in the Google Play store offering services ranging from Bitcoin money transfers to exchange tracking. On Apple\u2019s iTunes, there are almost 100 apps offering everything from mining monitoring -- a way to see how fast your computers are generating Bitcoins -- to virtual mobile courses on Bitcoin. Bitcoins emerged in 2008, designed by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity remains unknown. The currency isn\u2019t regulated by any government or central bank. New Bitcoins can only be created by solving complex problems embedded in the currency, keeping total growth limited. While Bitcoins could be used for nefarious purposes, they can also be a \u201clegal means of exchange,\u201d and policies need to be crafted to regulate their use, the U.S. Justice Department said at a U.S. Senate committee hearing last month.

Inc. and Google Inc. is jeopardizing consumer privacy and giving hackers an easy path to infect computers, a U.S. congressional investigation found. Now, armed with a better understanding of the opaque mechanics of Web ads, Senator Carl Levin and other lawmakers are asking whether stricter rules are needed to protect consumers, setting up a battle with companies that shaped the Internet. The tensions will play out at a Senate subcommittee hearing in Washington today when executives from Yahoo and Google testify before lawmakers leading the investigation. \u201cSelf regulation alone has not been enough,\u201d Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, told reporters in Washington yesterday. Yahoo\u2019s advertising network was compromised in December by hackers, resulting in a virus being installed on computers of users when they visited ads on legitimate websites, according to a report released by Levin\u2019s panel. In February, cybercriminals carried out a similar attack on Google\u2019s YouTube video service through an ad delivered by the company, the report found. The Federal Trade Commission \u201cshould consider issuing comprehensive regulations to prohibit deceptive and unfair online advertising practices\u201d if companies fail to abide by their own data-use and privacy policies, according to the Senate subcommittee staff report. A presidential review of online data-collection practices released earlier this month made six recommendations to ensure greater privacy, including a consumer bill of rights and national standards for data-breach notifications. Scheduled to testify before Levin\u2019s panel today is Alex Stamos, Yahoo\u2019s chief information security officer, and George Salem, a Google senior product manager. Online advertisers spent $42.8 billion in 2013, surpassing broadcast television as the largest advertising medium in the U.S., according to the report. The report revealed the behind-the-scenes mechanics that drive online advertising. The host of a website often has no idea what ads will appear or where they come from. Instead, other companies operating advertising exchanges use automated bidding systems in which clients pay to reach a target audience, the report found. Software is used to collect, store and analyze data about visitors to websites, which could help advertisers know better if someone has a health condition, is pregnant or looking for sporting goods, according to the report. The entire process can play out in less than one second as a Web page loads without the consumer\u2019s knowledge or consent. \u201cConsumers are largely unaware about of the enormous amount of data today being collected about them, how it\u2019s used and where it goes,\u201d Levin said. \u201cConsumers can be exposed to malware through advertisements and this malware can be transmitted directly to a consumer\u2019s computer without additional clicks.\u201d The staff report found that one visit to TMZ.com, a tabloid news website, triggered interaction with 352 other servers belonging to other companies. \u201cThe sheer volume of such activity makes it difficult for even the most vigilant consumer to control the data being collected or protect against its malicious use,\u201d the staff wrote. Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said Internet companies have failed to police themselves when it comes to informing consumers about their advertising policies and how the data they collect is used. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly improving our security systems and collaborating with industry partners to protect against malware and other fast-evolving abuses online,\u201d a Google spokeswoman, Samantha Smith, said in an e-mail. Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, is fighting online criminals and protecting users by weeding out malicious advertisements, stopping e-mail spam, paying users who find flaws in software code and working to encrypt all network traffic, Stamos said in written testimony for today\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe successfully block the vast majority of malicious or deceptive advertisements with which bad actors attack our network, and we always strive to defeat those who would compromise our customers\u2019 security,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery ad running on Yahoo\u2019s sites or on our ad network is inspected using this system, both when they are created and continuously afterward.\u201d The company acted quickly to remove malware found on websites in January and fixed the vulnerabilities, Stamos said. While new regulations generally aren\u2019t favored by conservative politicians, that may be the only way to protect consumers when it comes to Internet advertising practices, McCain told reporters. Legislation also may be necessary to give agencies like the Federal Trade Commission the power to enforce new rules and punish companies for violations in using data collected online, he said. The growth of online advertising also has fueled a rise in online crime, the report found. Criminals use online advertisements to deliver malicious code to the computers of innocent users, McCain said. There was a 200 percent increase in advertising with malicious code between 2012 and 2013, he said. The attack on Yahoo\u2019s advertising network lasted from Dec. 27, to Jan. 3. Yahoo briefed Senate staff on the attack, which was possible because a hacker gained access to an employee\u2019s account and was able to approve a malicious ad. \u201cThe malware in question spread without the need for user interaction,\u201d according to the report. \u201cWhen a user visited a website with Yahoo ads delivered, the user\u2019s browser, at Yahoo\u2019s direction, contacted the advertiser\u2019s server, which delivered malware to the user\u2019s browser instead of the image of an advertisement.\u201d The malware took control of computers to create bitcoins, a digital currency. The report found no evidence to suggest Google or Yahoo\u2019s ad network was any more vulnerable to malware attacks than any other major online ad network. \u201cYahoo and Google appear to follow standard industry practice,\u201d according to the report. \u201cHowever, the industry as a whole remains vulnerable to these forms of attack.\u201d Users didn\u2019t need to click on any ads on YouTube during the February attack on Google\u2019s network. Just watching a video was enough to get infected, according to the report. The malware was designed to break into online bank accounts and transfer funds to the criminals. \u201cAn unwitting consumer who visited YouTube and encountered this malware would have no opportunity to protect herself from potential financial ruin,\u201d according to the report. \u201cIf she suffered an attack, she would have little recourse unless she managed to track down the cybercriminal who launched the attack, an almost impossible task for security professionals and completely beyond the capabilities of an ordinary consumer.\u201d When law enforcement agents raided a hideout used by Russian cybercriminals, they found a calendar with U.S. holidays and three-day weekends highlighted, McCain said. The criminals highlighted those days because security would be weak for websites they wanted to digitally attack, McCain said.

More than 20 million usernames and passwords belonging to its customers were being dumped into a file, primed to be stolen. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d the team asked the Yahoo employee whose account was capturing the encrypted data. The download was blocked immediately, Motonobu Koh, a risk manager, recalled in a recent interview. Then the worker replied: \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything. I\u2019m at home.\u201d The April 2013 breach of Yahoo Japan, controlled by billionaire Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank Corp., was an attempt to grab the user identities of the nation\u2019s most visited website. The operation was similar in scale to the 2011 assault on U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp., said Itsuro Nishimoto, chief technology officer at LAC Co., Japan\u2019s first cybersecurity response center. Now, after a series of hacks on targets from the nation\u2019s space agency and its largest defense contractor to Bitcoin exchange operator Mt. Gox, Japan\u2019s government is set to pass a law in fall to beef up cybersecurity in the world\u2019s third-largest economy. Less than 25 percent of Japanese companies have a business continuity plan in case of a cyber-attack, according to the National Information Security Center, a government agency. \u201cThe biggest problem -- and the biggest ally of cyber-attackers aiming at Japan -- is the widespread belief that \u2018it can\u2019t happen here,\u2019\u201d said William Saito, an information technology strategy adviser to the nation\u2019s Cabinet. While the U.S. has named Internet attacks among its biggest threats, awareness in Japan is still \u201cvery low,\u201d he said. Companies in Japan are among the world\u2019s most vulnerable to an attack, and threats against state entities have more than doubled since 2010 to one every 30 seconds, according to the Ponemon Institute, a U.S.-based information security research center, and Japanese government data. The number of attacks in Japan surpassed 1 million in 2012, more than doubling from two years earlier, with the government trade negotiations team, the lower house of parliament and a nuclear power research institute among those hit, according to state data. Only about half of Japanese companies have an IT security policy, according to the National Information Security Center. The country has a shortage of 80,000 information security engineers, and about 60 percent of the existing ones lack the skills to counter online threats, the agency, known as NISC, said in a cybersecurity strategy report last year. The proposed new law would name NISC as the central cybersecurity coordinator reporting directly to Japan\u2019s Cabinet, said Takuya Hirai, a lawmaker with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party who drafted the bill. It would also require companies, which often don\u2019t disclose hacking attacks to avoid negative publicity, to report all such incidents. The bill was spurred in part by the need to prepare for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Hirai said in an interview. It has passed the lower house of the parliament and is awaiting upper-house action during the coming fall legislative session. The law will come too late for Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange. Lax security allowed hackers to steal about $473 million worth of the virtual currency, leading the company to file for bankruptcy in February. Sony Corp. was attacked at least 21 times in 2011, including a raid that stole personal data from about 77 million users of its PlayStation Network online service, according to the Open Security Foundation, based in Glen Allen, Virginia. Even the Japan Basketball Association isn\u2019t safe. Three attempts were made on its website since mid-February, which involved malicious code that redirected visitors to bugged servers, said Joji Hamada, a senior security response manager at Symantec Corp. in Tokyo. Targets may have included Finance Minister Taro Aso, who served as the association\u2019s chairman, or members of the International Olympic Committee who might visit the site, Hamada said. \u201cOne thing we\u2019re pretty sure about is that the end goal wasn\u2019t the JBA,\u201d Hamada said. Still, attacks against defense-related targets may be the biggest driver behind the proposed new cybersecurity law. In September 2011, the Yomiuri newspaper reported that computers and servers at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan\u2019s biggest defense contractor, were infiltrated, potentially compromising data on missile technology and nuclear reactors. The revelation was \u201ca huge slap\u201d and an embarrassment for Japan, said Paul Kallender, an associate researcher at the Global Security Research Institute at Keio University in Tokyo. Mitsubishi Heavy, which is involved in projects from Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 fighter plane to nuclear reactors for export to Turkey, is at the \u201capex of Japan\u2019s strategic and industrial base,\u201d he said. A spokesman for Mitsubishi Heavy said the company had no further comments on the incidents in 2011, other than affirming its commitment to best security practices. He asked not to be named, citing company policy. The Mitsubishi Heavy breach was a watershed moment, according to LAC\u2019s Nishimoto, who said his company\u2019s warnings about online spying against Japan had previously fallen on deaf ears. \u201cPeople understood for the first time that cyber-espionage is actually also happening in Japan,\u201d he said. That still didn\u2019t prevent more attacks. Starting in January 2012, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the country\u2019s equivalent of NASA, was breached three times over a 15-month span, according to the agency\u2019s website. The attacks on JAXA, as the space agency is known, may have been orchestrated by North Korea seeking information on rockets for use in its missile program, Nishimoto said. The initial attacks came as the agency was preparing to launch a next-generation rocket, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named for national security reasons. The hackers returned after the rocket failed to launch, looking for information on how JAXA was resolving the issue, the person said. A spokesman for JAXA said he couldn\u2019t comment on the attacks. He asked not to be named, citing agency policy. Some of the strikes on aerospace, energy and military targets in Japan and India in recent years were carried out by a sophisticated group of hackers using tools designed to mask their location, Tokyo-based security firm Trend Micro Inc. said in a 2012 report that nicknamed the group \u201cLuckyCat.\u201d One member of the group is a well-known Chinese hacker nicknamed \u201cdang0102,\u201d Trend Micro said. Cyberspying isn\u2019t just a national-security matter but also a threat to Japan Inc.\u2019s competitiveness, said Saito, the government adviser. Several unlisted websites and file-sharing portals hosted in China were discovered recently to contain hundreds of product designs and specifications of Japanese manufacturers, said two people familiar with the monitoring, asking not to be named because the research is a national security matter. While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint where the growing attacks against Japan are coming from, security companies agree that most of the servers used by hackers are in China and that viruses are often written using Chinese-language operating systems. The hackers may just be using the servers, and groups from more than one country are involved, Nishimoto said. The attacks leveled at Japan are on the same scale as those that prompted the U.S. to accuse China of state-backed industrial espionage, Nishimoto said. The U.S. government indicted five Chinese military officials in May for allegedly stealing trade secrets from American companies. China has denied the accusations. At Yahoo Japan, Koh, a principal at the chief executive officer\u2019s risk management office, said he has a pretty good idea where his adversaries came from. He declined to give specifics, citing the burden of proof. Just as Yahoo Japan had finished investigating the April 2013 breach, and ran tests to patch the holes used to enter its network, the attackers returned in May, exploiting a different route into the company\u2019s system. They also changed tack, copying smaller batches. Koh\u2019s unit detected them and again blocked their data mining, but not before they made off with data belonging to 1.5 million customers, he said. \u201cWe had shut them out in April, but they found another backdoor,\u201d Koh said. \u201cAs an engineer, it\u2019s pretty hard to swallow.\u201d By the time the attackers returned a third time last October, the company knew what it was facing and cut off the intruders at the start, preventing a breach. It was a \u201ccoordinated, professional group, which operated like a company\u201d with the aim of stealing trade secrets, Koh said. In all three attacks, the group used malware that was designed specifically for Yahoo Japan\u2019s computers and had the company\u2019s name written into its code, he said. To Saito, the attacks against Japanese targets are both a threat and an opportunity. Domestic companies should see IT security as a potential competitive advantage and an industry ripe for expansion, he said. \u201cAt this point, there only two types of companies in Japan: the ones that\u2019ve been attacked and the ones that just don\u2019t know it yet,\u201d Saito said. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in that. We just have to realize we\u2019re all victims here, and we need to work together to change it.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-08/yahoo-hacks-highlight-cyber-flaws-japan-rushing-to-thwart', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 8, 15, 0, 1, 1000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Yahoo Hacks Highlight Cyber Flaws Japan Rushing to Thwart'}, {'articleText': u'  The Bank of England will research whether issuing a digital currency such as Bitcoin would help it achieve its monetary policy, financial stability and regulatory goals. The technology underlying existing digital currencies \u201cmay have considerable promise,\u201d the BOE said in a paper published Wednesday. \u201cThis raises the question of whether central banks should themselves make use of such technology to issue digital currencies.\u201d Usage by a central bank could include interbank settlements and supporting use by non-financial companies and individuals, according to the paper. The bank published it as part of its introduction of its new research facility. While the BOE noted digital currencies\u2019 \u201ceconomic flaws,\u201d they\u2019ve nevertheless shown it\u2019s possible \u201cto transfer value securely without a trusted third party,\u201d the paper said. \u201cThis has potentially profound implications for a financial system whose payments mechanism depends on bank deposits that need to be created through credit.\u201d A technical hurdle to central bank digital currency comes from the need to develop a protocol for transferring value over the Internet. Such a standard would be akin to the achievement of Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, for transferring information, the paper said. Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, had $1.5 billion in circulation at the end of August 2013, according to a website managed by Bitcoin developers. \u201cA central bank-issued digital currency might be a more easily controlled means of settlement and exchange,\u201d Michael Kumhof, senior research adviser at the bank\u2019s new research project, said at a conference in London Wednesday. \u201cUnder digital currencies, identification and verification may have significantly higher real resource costs than other means of settlement,\u201d Kumhof said at the conference. However, a central bank would also save on the costs of production and distribution of physical money, he said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/boe-to-assess-creating-a-digital-currency-to-increase-stability', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 26, 18, 15, 14, 166000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BOE to Assess Creating a Digital Currency to Increase Stability'}, {'articleText': u'  The initiative requiring the Swiss National Bank to hold a fixed portion of its assets in gold makes no sense, according to Citigroup Inc., which said the metal was the equivalent of the virtual currency bitcoin. \u201cThere is no economic or financial case for a central bank to hold any single commodity, even if this commodity had intrinsic value,\u201d Willem Buiter, the bank\u2019s chief economist and a former Bank of England policy maker, wrote in a report dated yesterday. \u201cForbidding a central bank from ever selling any gold it owns reduces the value of those gold holdings to zero.\u201d In a move that SNB President Thomas Jordan calls \u201cdangerous,\u201d Switzerland holds a national referendum on Nov. 30 that would require the central bank to hold at least 20 percent of its assets from 8 percent in gold, all of which have to be stored in the country, and never sell any. A plurality of voters oppose the \u201cSave Our Swiss Gold\u201d measure, though a portion of them were still undecided, polls last week showed. Proponents of the initiative, which would also require repatriation of SNB bullion held in Canada and the U.K., say it would preserve national wealth, while the government and the central bank oppose it as they say it would hinder monetary policy. The central bank would have to buy at least 1,733 metric tons of gold, compared with annual production of about 2,500 tons, to meet the threshold by 2019, Citigroup said. With 1,040 metric tons, Switzerland is already the seventh-largest holder of gold by country, International Monetary Fund data show. The additional purchases, estimated by the SNB to be about 70 billion francs ($72.8 billion), would make it the biggest after the U.S. and Germany. Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,195.28 by 10:09 a.m. in London, down 0.5 percent this year after slumping 28 percent in 2013, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. Any potential Swiss purchases could trigger an 18 percent rally in prices, Bank of America Corp. estimates. The complexity of the referendum is a \u201csubstantial\u201d hurdle for a \u2018yes\u2019 outcome, according to Morgan Stanley. While \u2018yes\u2019 is good for gold prices, \u2018no\u2019 would be neutral, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. said in a Nov. 24 report. Like bitcoin, gold has no intrinsic value and is costly to produce and store, Buiter wrote. \u201cIf the central bank is to invest in commodities, better to have a balanced portfolio of commodities or, more conveniently, a balanced portfolio of commodity ETFs or other derivatives,\u201d he said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-27/citigroup-seeing-gold-as-bitcoin-says-swiss-vote-makes-no-sense', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 11, 27, 3, 44, 44, 668000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Citigroup Says Swiss Gold Reserves Vote Makes No Sense'}, {'articleText': u'  Negotiations had reached an impasse. On one side was BNP Paribas SA, France\u2019s biggest bank, with $2.5 trillion in assets. On the other was the New York Department of Financial Services, headed by Benjamin Lawsky. Talks between BNP and much bigger agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve, had gone on for months, with BNP agreeing to plead guilty to a criminal charge - - deliberately circumventing U.S. sanctions against Iran and Sudan -- and pay a multibillion-dollar fine. Lawsky wanted more, including the dismissal of BNP executives and suspension of the French bank\u2019s ability to do transactions in U.S. dollars, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its October special issue on the 50 Most Influential people in global finance. Lawsky\u2019s demands got attention at the highest level: The government of President Francois Hollande lobbied the Obama administration to limit the overall penalty, and Christian Noyer, head of the Bank of France, traveled to New York to personally meet with Lawsky. In the end, a deal was worked out, with BNP agreeing to a limited suspension of its dollar-clearing privileges. Lawsky, for his part, had once again demonstrated the global power of his fledgling agency and his willingness to push hard for settlements on his terms. Lawsky derives his sway from the fact that the world\u2019s leading financial institutions need to do business in the U.S., and many hold licenses issued by the state of New York. His department, created in 2011 by the state legislature, claims jurisdiction over 1,900 such companies. He has even proposed to grant \u201cbitlicenses\u201d to creators of bitcoins and other virtual currencies. Lawsky, 44, a former federal prosecutor who worked with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo when Cuomo was the state\u2019s attorney general, is the DFS\u2019s first superintendent. The agency combines two predecessors, the departments of banking and insurance. The new department has authority over banks licensed in New York and insurers based in the state. It also has enhanced power to regulate all financial products and services sold there, which has allowed Lawsky to extend his reach well beyond what the old banking and insurance departments could do. The regulator, whose agency has the power to bring civil suits but not criminal actions, says the DFS benefits from being smaller and more agile than big agencies such as the Justice Department. \u201cWe can test things out, do things out of the box,\u201d he says in an interview in his spartan offices in lower Manhattan. And he feels no compunction about refusing to follow what other agencies may recommend. \u201cWe will not go with the flow if it\u2019s just to go with the flow,\u201d he says. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re just a little old state regulator, but we won\u2019t do it that way.\u201d Eric Dinallo, who served as New York\u2019s superintendent of insurance from 2007 to 2009, says Lawsky\u2019s involvement in a series of big settlements has given the New York regulator an unusually high profile. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can dispute that in a short period of time, by emphasizing enforcement, consumer financial protection and an expansive reading of the term financial products, Lawsky\u2019s put the agency on the map on a national and international basis,\u201d Dinallo says. Critics say Lawsky conducts his investigations by press release. BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed described Lawsky\u2019s technique this way in a June 30 column: \u201cEvidence is published, and incendiary claims detailed.\u201d And even as it praised the result in the BNP case, a Wall Street Journal editorial on June 16 labeled Lawsky a \u201cpublicity hound.\u201d Matt Anderson, a Lawsky spokesman, says: \u201cLike most regulatory and law enforcement agencies, we announce some of the work we do to deter misconduct.\u201d It was through a salvo in the press that Lawsky first made his mark outside U.S. borders back in 2012. As representatives of the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, the Fed and the New York County District Attorney\u2019s office inched toward a settlement with London-based Standard Chartered Plc over allegations that the lender had also skirted U.S. sanctions against Iran, Lawsky struggled to make his voice heard, according to a person familiar with the matter. Lawsky sent a deputy to a meeting of law enforcement and regulatory agencies to discuss progress on the case. The deputy told them that Lawsky couldn\u2019t understand why, more than a year after the investigation was completed, the case wasn\u2019t settled. The deputy, this person says, delivered an ultimatum: If the other regulators didn\u2019t move forward on Standard Chartered in a timely fashion, Lawsky was prepared to act on his own. The warning was ignored, the person says. So on Aug. 6, 2012, Lawsky sent a letter to Standard Chartered cataloging its alleged illegal wire transactions for Iranian clients and demanding to know why he shouldn\u2019t rescind its license to operate in New York. He released the letter to the media. The broadside caught the bank\u2019s executives by surprise and sent Standard Chartered\u2019s shares down 16 percent for the day. Lawsky\u2019s move also left prosecutors and his fellow regulators from Treasury and the Fed flat-footed, according to people familiar with the matter. They were informed only hours before the letter was released. Lawsky\u2019s pre-emptive strike fractured his relationships with the Justice Department, the Fed and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., according to people briefed on the matter. Eventually, Standard Chartered reached a $340 million settlement with Lawsky\u2019s office and agreed to hire a monitor. In late 2012, the bank struck a $327 million settlement to resolve the same issues with other regulators. Last month, Lawsky censured Standard Chartered once more, assessing a $300 million penalty following revelations that the bank was not identifying all the high-risk transactions it was executing around the world. The list of financial giants against which Lawsky has taken enforcement actions is long. It includes Credit Suisse Group AG, Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP, insurance giant MetLife Inc. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. On Aug. 18, Lawsky\u2019s office announced that a consulting arm of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers had agreed to pay a $25 million fine and to stop taking on certain new business assignments from New York\u2013regulated banks for two years. PricewaterhouseCoopers agreed to the settlement after Lawsky uncovered evidence that it had agreed to remove language from a 2008 report implicating Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., one the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, in circumventing U.S. sanctions against Iran and other countries. Lawsky honed his in-your-face style while working for some assertive politicians. After starting his career as an attorney in the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, he was hired in 1999 by U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York as chief counsel. Then, from 2001 to 2007, Lawsky served as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he worked with Preet Bharara, then an assistant U.S. Attorney and now chief prosecutor. Cuomo, who was elected New York attorney general in 2006, hired Lawsky as a special assistant and deputy counsel. In the wake of the financial meltdown, Lawsky led some of the state\u2019s highest-profile investigations of Wall Street, including the takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America and the collapse of the auction-rate securities market. A Pittsburgh native, Lawsky was captain of his high school basketball team. He graduated from Columbia University in New York with a degree in art history and then matriculated at Columbia\u2019s law school. An active athlete, he has run in the New York City Marathon and in August competed in the West Point Triathlon. His wife, Jessica Roth, who also worked as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, teaches at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York. Standard Chartered isn\u2019t the only firm to watch its stock drop after Lawsky started a public inquiry. Earlier this year, he launched a probe of Atlanta-based mortgage servicer Ocwen Financial Corp. In a letter released to the media on Feb. 26, he questioned why the company funneled so much business to firms controlled by Ocwen Chief Executive Officer and Chairman William Erbey. The company\u2019s shares dropped 7 percent that day and were down 50 percent for the year as of Sept. 12. Ocwen is seeking to acquire the right to service $39 billion in mortgages held by Wells Fargo & Co. -- a move Lawsky has blocked. Ocwen says it\u2019s cooperating with Lawsky\u2019s probe. In March, Lawsky also made public a letter to Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. asking the Lewisville, Texas\u2013based mortgage servicer for details of its foreclosure practices. Shares in Nationstar dropped to $29 from $32 in 20 minutes and were down 12.6 percent for the year as of Sept. 12. Nationstar also says it is cooperating. Kyle Bass, founder of hedge-fund firm Hayman Capital Management LP, which owns more than 5 percent of Nationstar\u2019s shares, complains that such actions punish investors before any wrongdoing has been proven or even alleged. \u201cI like what he\u2019s doing, because he makes our markets better,\u201d Bass says of Lawsky. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to conduct a fact-finding mission, do it in private.\u201d Lawsky kept his press releases in check while helping negotiate the BNP settlement. The bank ultimately agreed to the criminal guilty plea and a record-setting $8.9 billion fine, more than $3 billion of which will go to New York state. In exchange for the guilty plea -- which the Justice Department sought to prove that no bank was \u201ctoo big to jail\u201d -- Lawsky agreed not to pull BNP\u2019s New York banking license. All that was left to resolve was Lawsky\u2019s demand for the suspension of the bank\u2019s ability to execute foreign trades using U.S. dollars. After meeting with French central bank head Noyer, Lawsky settled for a targeted, temporary suspension of dollar-clearing privileges at the BNP offices in Paris, Geneva, Milan, Rome and Singapore, where the sanctions violations originated. On June 13, Anthony Albanese, Lawsky\u2019s chief of staff, traveled to Paris to present the plan to European regulators. He joined a U.S. delegation that included Thomas Baxter of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other U.S. banking officials. Bank regulators from Belgium, France, Italy, Switzerland and the U.K. peppered Albanese with questions. Afterward, they all lunched together. The final hurdle to an agreement had been cleared. The BNP negotiations cemented Lawsky\u2019s future role. \u201cLawsky has a seat at the table, and he can be a legitimate participant in ways people didn\u2019t imagine before,\u201d says former insurance superintendent Dinallo, who\u2019s now a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. Lawsky says his tough stand in the 2012 Standard Chartered case helped ease the way to a more cooperative effort on BNP. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the intent,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was definitely the consequence of what we did.\u201d U.S. Attorney Bharara says the BNP settlement, announced on June 30, was a model of interagency cooperation compared with the Standard Chartered food fight. \u201cOne of the great stories out of the BNP resolution is that a number of different prosecutors and regulators behaved maturely and with a common goal and wisdom and got a result that would in the past have been undoable,\u201d Bharara says. \u201cEveryone was kept on the reservation.\u201d Lawsky isn\u2019t issuing any guarantees that there won\u2019t be future battles with his fellow regulators. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stand up and say, \u2018That\u2019s a terrible idea, and we\u2019re just not going to do it,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re willing to say that, people realize you\u2019ll put your money where your mouth is.

The U.S. Marshals Service, which is planning to auction bitcoins seized last year from the illicit Silk Road marketplace, sent a message today to almost 40 e-mail addresses of people and groups who submitted questions about the sale, which takes place June 27. The cache of 29,656 bitcoins being offered has a value of about $18 million at today\u2019s prices. The list of recipients included representatives of Rangeley Capital, SecondMarket Holdings Inc., Coinbase Inc. and DRW Holdings LLC, according to a copy of the e-mail seen by Bloomberg. Most of them haven\u2019t responded to, or declined requests, for comment from Bloomberg. People who decide to bid in the auction must put up a $200,000 deposit. U.S. Marshals said they weren\u2019t going to identify the winner or winners of the auction, and the now-public list of people and firms looking at the sale raised concerns among some potential bidders about privacy, competition and potential future harassment by hackers. \u201cIt just removes some of the opaqueness that was originally intended around the process, and gives me an idea of how many people are going to be participating,\u201d said Luther Lowe, who is considering bidding in the auction and whose e-mail address was exposed. The list of potential competitors seemed short, and may draw more people hoping to buy the virtual currency at a discount, he said in an interview. Others said it could dissuade buyers. \u201cMany people, as individuals, haven\u2019t found a good way to store bitcoin,\u201d said Ilya Subkhankulov, co-founder of bitcoin-trading software provider BTX Trader LLC, which plans to bid. \u201cThere are some people on there, if they win the auction, they may be at risk for phishing attacks and other security issues. For us as a company, it\u2019s not great. But we are a bitcoin company, we spend a lot of time thinking about these things and securing bitcoin.\u201d Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals Service, said the disclosure of e-mail addresses was unintentional and apologized for the breach. \u201cThe message was not intended for any particular group of people, but for anyone who had e-mailed a question to the general mailbox to ask about the auction,\u201d Donahue said. The auction offers a chance for buyers to acquire a large stockpile of bitcoins without driving up prices in the market, according to Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. He estimated that amassing a similar hoard on exchanges could boost prices by 20 percent. Bitcoin has declined 4.1 percent to $605 since the auction was announced on June 12, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which represents an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. \u201cFor us as a potential bidder, we get to see what other players might be bidding,\u201d Subkhankulov said. \u201cIt helps us figure out who may be bidding, how much they might be bidding.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-18/bitcoin-bidders-in-big-sale-irked-as-government-outs-their-names', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 18, 21, 27, 3, 218000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Bidders in Big Sale Irked as Government Outs Their Names'}, {'articleText': u' Bitcoin exchange Gemini Trust Company LLC received authorization from the New York State Department of Financial Services to start operations, the latest startup to step its toes into a market that\u2019s gone through upheaval. The exchange was founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who claimed Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social-networking website to start Facebook Inc. The twins have moved on to become entrepreneurs in the bitcoin industry, built around a software-based currency that can be used to trade anything from electronics to illicit items on the Internet. Gemini is the second bitcoin company to be designated by the agency as a trust; exchange ItBit Trust Co. gained approval in May. The\xa0Winklevoss duo have said that the lack of a regulated market is responsible for the volatility in the price of bitcoins versus other currencies. Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, filed\xa0for bankruptcy in February 2014 after disclosing it couldn\u2019t account for several thousand units of the virtual currency. Gemini will be secure, and offer protection against fraud and money laundering, the pair said in a statement Monday. "Bitcoin is an island right now and Gemini is building a bridge to the financial mainland," Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini\u2019s chief executive officer, said in the statement. "We wanted to build an exchange that both Main Street and Wall Street could use and trust." Moving money into and out of Gemini accounts will be free, the company said. A trading fee, currently about 25 basis points of the value of the trade, will apply to both the buyer and seller, it said. The exchange will be open for trading from Oct. 8. Gemini\u2019s status as\xa0a chartered limited liability trust lets it operate nationwide without having to apply for money-transmitter licenses from individual states that require them. It also lets the company potentially offer a variety of other services for institutional investors, such as hold assets in collateral in transactions.

Then there\u2019s Stripe Inc. Getting included on Apple\u2019s list was a coup for the five-year-old startup, which will enable mobile applications to work with Apple Pay. It\u2019s the latest success for Stripe, which is also powering an e-commerce feature for Twitter Inc., working with Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd.\u2019s Alipay, and helping thousands of other companies process online and mobile payments. The challenge for San Francisco-based Stripe is fending off EBay Inc.\u2019s PayPal and traditional financial companies that are barreling into mobile payments. The burgeoning market -- with global spending on commerce via handheld gadgets set to reach $720 billion in 2017, up from $300 billion this year, according to IDC -- has brought on a crowded field of competitors. \u201cWe\u2019re hugely excited about the Apple announcement, but this is just another step along the way,\u201d said Patrick Collison, 26, who along with his brother, John, 24, founded Stripe in 2009. Stripe\u2019s partnerships with Apple and Twitter now catapult it onto a bigger stage, cementing its elite spot among Silicon Valley startups. In a sign of its trajectory, the company, which is widely regarded as a potential initial public offering candidate or acquisition target down the road, landed a $1.75 billion valuation this year, up from $100 million less than two years ago. At first glance, Stripe doesn\u2019t look too different from other payments startups. The company offers processing services for online and mobile transactions, which customers such as ride-sharing provider Lyft Inc. can integrate into their apps. Stripe typically takes a 2.9 percent fee, plus 30 cents, of each successful transaction. Yet Stripe stands out from rivals for the amount and ease of code it offers, which lets software programmers quickly incorporate the payment features into their apps. Stripe lets businesses start processing credit-card payments in 139 different currencies, bank transfers, bitcoin and Alipay in less than five minutes, according to the company. \u201cThey execute very quickly on new features, and they\u2019re always ahead of the curve,\u201d Lyft Chief Executive Officer Logan Green said. He said his San Francisco-based company began using Stripe in early 2013 and liked how it could automate features such as proving the validity of charges that consumers don't immediately recognize. \u201cWe would have needed a team of 20 people just stamping envelopes\u201d to do that, Green said. Stripe has the backing of investors including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Max Levchin. It has raised about $140 million in funding, with its $1.75 billion valuation pegged to a financing in January. Stripe\u2019s workforce, housed in an office in San Francisco\u2019s hip Mission District, now numbers 160 people, up from 90 at the beginning of the year. The company declined to disclose revenue or say whether it\u2019s profitable. \u201cThis company has been capturing the hearts and minds of developers responsible for making online payments possible for their companies,\u201d said Mike Moritz, a Sequoia venture capitalist who sits on Stripe\u2019s board. Stripe\u2019s roots go back to the small town of Dromineer, Ireland, where the Collisons were raised. The brothers showed geeky propensities early on. Patrick won an Irish national science award in high school for creating a new version of a 50-year-old artificial-intelligence computing language called Lisp. He later majored in math and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. John received the highest score ever on Ireland\u2019s nationwide college entrance exam, then headed to Harvard University. While in the Boston area, the pair built an EBay competitor called Auctomatic and sold it less than a year later for $5 million. The pair started Stripe in Boston in 2009, and then left their respective colleges -- they are still on leave from the institutions -- to focus on the startup full time. In 2010, they moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to build the business. The opportunity ahead is large. Stripe may be able to snag a share of not only online but also offline in-store transactions, for which consumers may pay with phones, James Wester, an analyst at researcher IDC, said in an interview. Another startup seeking to benefit from the mobile-payments boom is Square Inc., which has a device attachment that lets small merchants accept customers\u2019 credit and debit cards. The company has been in talks to raise financing at a $6 billion valuation, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Stripe\u2019s hurdles remain high, including facing competitors like Google Inc. and PayPal. EBay last year acquired mobile-payment service Braintree for $800 million, and dozens of other startups have been bought by the likes of Google and Intuit Inc. Stripe\u2019s growth will also depend partly on whether Apple Pay and Twitter\u2019s commerce efforts take off. \u201cTwitter has to first break the code on how to sell things, and Stripe is instrumental to that,\u201d Richard Crone, CEO of Crone Consulting LLC, said in an interview. \u201cIf they do it right there, then any social media can be monetized. All the other players will beat a path to the door, and they could follow the same trajectory as PayPal.\u201d Twitter\u2019s head of e-commerce, Nathan Hubbard, said earlier this month that the San Francisco-based company uses Stripe because it wants to make payments frictionless. With Stripe, when people enter credit-card information into Twitter, \u201cit\u2019s stored and trust and safety and security are paramount to us,\u201d he said in an interview. With Apple, Stripe spent the past two months working with the iPhone maker on Apple Pay, according to a company founder and investors. Apple Pay will let consumers buy items in brick-and-mortar stores by tapping phones on cash registers. It will also simplify buying online through mobile phones, said Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. \u201cBuying things on the Internet from your mobile phone is still very clumsy and complicated,\u201d said Dixon, who has also personally invested in Stripe. \u201cApple Pay can solve this issue and accelerate Stripe\u2019s and mobile payment growth.\u201d Bloomberg LP is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz. Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, didn\u2019t have a comment. As for Stripe\u2019s prospects, Patrick Collison declined to comment on an IPO, saying the company\u2019s focus is \u201c100 percent on building that platform.\u201d He said potential acquirers \u201cping you wanting to talk all the time,\u201d adding that the startup has been clear that it isn\u2019t interested in a sale.

While Ecuador hasn\u2019t said it plans to use the currency to fund spending and the legislation states that people can refuse to accept it as payment, Landesbank Berlin Investments says Correa may seek to use it to compensate workers and contractors and conserve hard cash. \u201cThis is usually the start of debasement, inflation and depreciation,\u201d Lutz Roehmeyer, who helps manage about $1.1 billion of emerging-market assets at Landesbank Berlin, including Ecuadorean debt, said in an interview. Roehmeyer, who\u2019s been investing in Ecuador for more than 15 years and correctly predicted its last two defaults, plans to reduce his holdings of the nation\u2019s debt. The firm holds some of the $2 billion of bonds that Ecuador sold in June. The Economic Policy Ministry declined to comment on the new currency and referred questions to the central bank. The bank\u2019s press office also declined to comment and referred to a June resolution signed by the bank\u2019s general manager, Mateo Villalba. The resolution says electronic dollars will be backed by liquid assets and can\u2019t be swapped for government bonds. The virtual currency will increase access to the banking system among the country\u2019s poorest residents while being easier and more hygienic to use than dollar bills, central bank President Diego Martinez said in congressional testimony, according to a statement published in the official gazette on June 4. Globally, digital currencies led by bitcoin have gained acceptance as a means of payment that have been promoted as a replacement for traditional money. Unlike Ecuador\u2019s plan, most virtual currencies were developed as an alternative to government-backed tender. Ecuador has posted current-account deficits for each of the past four years, draining dollars from an economy that adopted the greenback as its sole currency in 2000. The government expects a $4.5 billion budget gap this year after public spending more than tripled since Correa took power in 2007. To prevent a dollar shortage crimping public spending, the government used more than half its gold reserves as collateral to obtain a $400 million loan from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in May. The same month, it reached an accord with China to borrow $2 billion in return for future oil output. Then in June, the government sold $2 billion in debt, in part by offering the second-highest interest on a similarly rated dollar bond sold this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Correa still sought help from the Latin American Reserve Fund, known as Flar, a month later to prop up the country\u2019s balance of payments with a record $618 million loan. With Correa boosting spending on public-works projects and social programs to reduce poverty, the Finance Ministry forecast in November that Ecuador would need to borrow about $35 billion through 2017. The temptation to use the new currency to pay bills will increase as the government exhausts its current sources of dollars, according to Jose Mieles, an economist at Quito-based research institute Cordes. Members of Correa\u2019s party in congress defeated efforts by industry groups to include a guarantee to back up the new currency with an equal amount of dollars in the new law, saying it was unnecessary. \u201cThe problem would be if they began to pay local creditors\u201d with the new currency, he said in an interview. \u201cThey could use these resources to get immediate liquidity.\u201d Yields on Ecuador\u2019s benchmark bonds due in 2024 have fallen 0.26 percentage point since trading began on June 20 to 7.33 percent as of 3:37 p.m. in New York. That compares with an average 0.13 percentage point increase for developing nations. Analysts are waiting to see how the government will implement the new system, said Juan Lorenzo Maldonado, a Latin America economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. \u201cIf they find a way to make an efficient use of the electronic currency to manage just certain types of payments and make some procedures easier and faster, and they hold themselves on doing it responsibly, it may be a good thing,\u201d he said. Ecuadoreans may try to get their savings out of the country to avoid being paid with virtual money, according to Steffen Reichold, an economist at Stone Harbor Investment Partners LP, which oversees $65.3 billion of fixed income. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be converted into a new currency managed by an untested central bank,\u201d Reichold said. Creating a currency \u201cisn\u2019t straightforward even when you\u2019re in a country with a perfect track record of successful economic management, and I don\u2019t think Ecuador is in that category.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-11/ecuador-turning-to-virtual-currency-after-oil-loans-correct-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 8, 11, 22, 12, 21, 990000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Ecuador Turning to Virtual Currency After Oil Loans'}, {'articleText': u'  Raoul Weil, who once ran UBS AG\u2019s global wealth-management business, was cleared at trial of tax conspiracy despite the bank\u2019s historic admission in 2009 that it helped thousands of U.S. clients abuse Swiss bank secrecy to cheat the Internal Revenue Service. The federal jury in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, reached its verdict after deliberating about 90 minutes yesterday. Weil, 54, was indicted in 2008 on a charge of conspiring to help as many as 17,000 U.S. taxpayers hide $20 billion from the IRS. Weil was arrested last year in Bologna, Italy, and waived extradition. Weil, who didn\u2019t testify, had faced five years in prison. Weil is the highest-ranking official of three dozen foreign bankers, lawyers and advisers charged in a seven-year U.S. probe of offshore tax evasion. UBS, the largest Swiss bank, avoided prosecution in February 2009 by paying a $780 million fine and admitting it helped clients evade taxes from 2000 to 2007. \u201cThe verdict shows you the difficulty of going after senior management who can at times blame the bank\u2019s customers and lower-level employees for the bank\u2019s mistakes,\u201d Nathan Hochman, a former assistant attorney general who oversaw the Justice Department\u2019s tax division, said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to prove a historical case beyond a reasonable doubt when the government heavily relies on witnesses who have received very favorable treatment.\u201d The Weil verdict was the second tax trial loss for the U.S. in less than a week after a Los Angeles jury acquitted a retired senior vice president at Israeli-based Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd. on charges he helped U.S. customers conceal their assets from the IRS. Prosecutors argued that Weil knew that UBS used sham corporate structures to help U.S. clients hide their identities from the IRS, and its bankers used cloak-and-dagger methods to deliver them cash and account statements. Menchel argued in his summation that prosecutors failed to prove that Weil was part of a single conspiracy involving taxpayers. He also said that Weil was unaware of the activities of a group of bankers below him. Matthew Menchel, Weil\u2019s lawyer, said, \u201cThis case never should have been brought.\u201d The case is U.S. v. Weil, 08-cr-60322, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). JPMorgan Faces U.S. Criminal Investigation Into Currency Trading JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it faces a U.S. criminal probe into foreign-exchange dealings and boosted its maximum estimate for \u201creasonably possible\u201d losses on legal cases to the highest in more than a year. The firm is cooperating with the criminal investigation by the Department of Justice as well as inquiries by regulators in the U.K. and elsewhere, it said yesterday in a quarterly report. The largest U.S. bank said it might need as much as $5.9 billion to cover losses beyond reserves for legal matters, up $1.3 billion from the end of June, and the most since mid-2013. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, who led the New York-based firm through $23 billion in settlements last year, is contending with an international probe into whether traders at the biggest banks sought to profit by rigging currency rates. Citigroup Inc. and Zurich-based UBS AG disclosed last week they also face criminal inquiries by the Justice Department into their foreign-exchange dealings. \u201cThese investigations are focused on the firm\u2019s spot FX trading activities as well as controls applicable to those activities,\u201d JPMorgan said its report. While the company is in talks to resolve the cases, \u201cthere is no assurance that such discussions will result in settlements,\u201d it said. JPMorgan booked $1.01 billion in legal expenses during the third quarter, tied \u201cin large part\u201d to the currency probes, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on Oct. 14.

The FTC told BP on Oct. 1 that it would end the investigation, Europe\u2019s third-largest oil producer said. The European Commission, Japanese Fair Trade Commission, Korean Fair Trade Commission and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission have no deadline to complete their inquiries, it said. \u201cThe FTC informed us they weren\u2019t proceeding with their investigation, something which we see as a positive development,\u201d Morten Eek, a Statoil spokesman, said by e-mail. The European Commission raided offices of BP, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Statoil in May 2013 on concerns over possible manipulation of prices in the global oil market. Platts, a price-reporting unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc.; Argos Energies; and Abengoa SA were also targets of the probe. The U.S. FTC and Japanese commission started quizzing BP in June 2013. The Korean commission opened an inquiry in December, and the U.S. CFTC requested price-reporting documents from BP the following month.

Fed Issues Rule Bolstering Standards for Payment-System Firms The Federal Reserve issued a final rule to strengthen standards for how systemically important payment and settlement systems would wind themselves down if they were in danger of failing, according to a statement by the central bank.

SEC Adds Wyly Family to Suit in Bid to Secure $187 Million The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission added the wives and children of Sam and Charles Wyly to a fraud suit it\u2019s already won, all in a bid to secure its $187.7 million award, plus interest, against them. Sam\u2019s wife and eldest son, along with Charles\u2019s widow, and a dozen other relatives were named yesterday in an amended lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, which regulators say is needed to halt the dissipation of assets, including spending by family members. Sam Wyly and and his late brother\u2019s wife, Caroline, both filed for bankruptcy this month, citing a need to preserve assets as they face a forfeiture order. A federal jury in Manhattan found the brothers, who developed companies including the arts and crafts retailer Michaels Stores Inc., hid stock offshore and made illegal trades for 13 years. Regulators say they fear assets could be depleted by relatives of Sam Wyly and the estate of Charles Wyly, who was killed in an auto accident in 2011. The relatives that have been added to the lawsuit, including the 10 children of Sam and Charles Wyly, don\u2019t have any lawful right to assets of the defendants because they are \u201ctraceable to the ill-gotten gains, derived from the defendants\u2019 fraudulent conduct,\u201d the SEC said. The SEC already has challenged the legitimacy of Samuel Wyly\u2019s bankruptcy, arguing he is using it to make an \u201cend run\u201d around the regulator\u2019s enforcement action. Lawyers for the brothers said they don\u2019t have enough money to pay the judgment ordered by Scheindlin. Family members have written Scheindlin arguing against an asset freeze, saying it might harm innocent third parties. David Kornblau, a lawyer who represents Cheryl and Evan Wyly and Martha Miller, a daughter of Charles, declined to comment on the SEC\u2019s amended lawsuit. Scheindlin issued an asset freeze to curb further spending before she issues a final judgment in the case. Stephen Susman, a lawyer for Charles Wyly\u2019s estate, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment on the SEC filing. The SEC lawsuit is SEC v. Wyly, 10-cv-05760, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

The dramatic reversal -- bitcoin reached more than $1,100 in 2013 and is now trading at about $350 -- is prompting told-you-sos from skeptics who long said the currency\u2019s promise was overhyped. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s on its last legs, but it\u2019s not looking good,\u201d said Nathalie Reinelt, an analyst at financial consulting firm Aite Group, who has written reports expressing doubts that bitcoin will become a mainstream currency. \u201cIt\u2019s not in a healthy state.\u201d There are still plenty of bitcoin diehards out there. Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper remains a booster. Conferences devoted to the so-called cryptocurrency are attracting droves of adherents. Venture capital firms are funding bitcoin-related startups. Companies from Microsoft Corp. to Overstock.com Inc. accept bitcoin as payment. Bitcoin proponents like the relative anonymity afforded by the virtual currency. Because users can register for bitcoin wallets without disclosing their identity, they can buy and sell stuff without the government looking over their shoulder. Regulation could end that. A proposal under consideration in New York State, for example, would require companies that store or exchange virtual currencies to obtain licenses and verify customers\u2019 identities and addresses. Ukraine has banned bitcoin altogether, China has prohibited banks from clearing bitcoin transactions and Russia is considering fining users. With bitcoin under pressure, more than 500 alternative cryptocurrencies are vying for acceptance, according to CoinMarketCap, a website that tracks virtual currencies. Many borrow and build on bitcoin technology and some are now trying to comply with existing regulations. One called Ripple lets banks transfer money in seconds, without spending days to clear transactions. MaidSafeCoin allows people to pay to store files on other users\u2019 hard drives, among other services. Investors are bullish on the newer entrants. MaidSafeCoin has more than quadrupled in value since its April debut, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple has gained 36 percent this year; eventually it could displace bitcoin, Reinelt said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a muddled message with bitcoin,\u201d said Chris Larsen, who runs Ripple Labs. \u201cThere are some players who want it to be anonymous, some that want it to be compliant. We don\u2019t like the anonymous aspects. We are compliant from Day One. We constructed it to go in the opposite direction.\u201d Steven Englander, managing director at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said building new currency systems from the ground up using parts of bitcoin technology may make more sense than trying to modify bitcoin so it adheres to requirements likely to be imposed by financial regulators. \u201cOver time, I think other alternatives will emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be one coin fits all -- it will be a basket of characteristics.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-15/bitcoin-bears-say-told-you-so-as-digital-currency-falls', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 12, 15, 14, 24, 28, 487000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Bears Say Told-You-So as Digital Currency Falls'}, {'articleText': u'  Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said the central bank is closely monitoring developments in digital money such as bitcoin. The bank views bitcoin more as an investment product than a currency, and in general the use of digital currencies isn\u2019t widespread enough to pose a risk to the financial system, Wilkins said. Canada\u2019s central bank has boosted its research into digital currencies amid the growing use of bitcoin to exchange goods and services. The Bank of Canada is responsible for the production and security of paper money. \u201cE-money is not big enough to pose material risk to financial stability in Canada at this time,\u201d Wilkins said in a speech today at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario. She didn\u2019t discuss the central bank\u2019s 1 percent policy interest rate in the speech or when responding afterwards to audience questions. \u201cThat said, money and payments technology is progressing in leaps and bounds, and so the Bank of Canada is watching developments closely.\u201d Using so-called cryptocurrencies carries risks including theft, fraud and the potential for money laundering, Wilkins said. If digital money were to gain widespread acceptance, it would also create issues for the central bank, particularly for cryptocurrencies. That\u2019s because transactions wouldn\u2019t be denominated in Canadian dollars, Wilkins said. \u201cThis would reduce the bank\u2019s ability to influence macroeconomic activity through Canadian interest rates,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cLet me be clear, we are nowhere near this point today but if we were, it would be even more important to determine whether issuing e-money is a role that should be done by the central bank.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-13/canada-s-wilkins-says-digital-money-not-big-enough-to-be-risk', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 11, 13, 21, 14, 10, 662000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Canada\u2019s Wilkins Says Digital Money Not Big Enough to Be Risk'}, {'articleText': u'  Samsung Electronics Co. is working with International Business Machines Corp. to use bitcoin technology for new applications. While bitcoin\u2019s price has almost halved in the past year and the prospects for the digital currency are uncertain, its underlying software is attracting companies like phone makers, carriers and banks. That\u2019s because the technology can be tweaked to record changes in ownership of any asset in a public ledger using a distributed network of computers or mobile phones. It could help facilitate all types of online transactions. Samsung Research America, a division based in Silicon Valley, has researchers looking at using the so-called bitcoin blockchain to design better ways to verify \u201cthat what you say is authentic is authentic,\u201d said Steven Rahman, director of strategy at the research division. Samsung makes electronics ranging from Galaxy smartphones to home appliances and TVs. The Suwon, South Korea-based company also runs music radio and video services, a mobile-payment service, and offers a variety of apps. \u201cThe blockchain technology is very interesting in general, and it can be applied in a lot of areas,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cCurrency, it\u2019s just the first use case. You could imagine that anything, like prescriptions, could be managed with the blockchain technology.\u201d Samsung Research America usually develops technologies that may be used in commercial products in two to five years, he said, declining to provide further details about the bitcoin project. The bitcoin blockchain could allow for cheaper money transfer and be used for storage of files like songs and videos, which currently require companies to either buy hundreds of servers or lease capacity from other service providers. Other companies have become interested in the technology. Orange SA\u2019s Silicon Valley-based venture-capital arm has said it\u2019s looking to invest in bitcoin startups.

The idea was this: Let people trade stock in hot young companies -- before those companies go public. At the time, it seemed crazy. A decade on, Silbert\u2019s creation, SecondMarket Solutions Inc., has drawn the interest of\xa0Nasdaq Inc., which bought it for an undisclosed sum to combine with its own market for non-public companies, Nasdaq Private Market. The price was said to be less than $10 million, according to a person briefed on the deal. Their merged client base will include more than 200 private companies, including Pinterest Inc., Tango Inc. and DocuSign Inc.\xa0 \u201cWhat I envisioned was creating a whole new category of companies that were not public but were not quite private,\u201d Silbert, 39, said in an interview. \u201cI think we were very successful creating this new category that\u2019s been growing very, very fast. It was never built to be sold. So I\u2019m certainly excited and pleased to see the company end up with such a big company like Nasdaq.\u201d The acquisition will give a boost to Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Bob Greifeld\u2019s push into the world of pre-initial public offering companies. The newer, bigger 30-person Private Market, to be led by SecondMarket CEO Bill Siegel, will keep working to persuade fledgling companies to stay private rather than go for the quick money -- and burdens -- of an IPO. For the moment, the markets are on his side: 2015 has been a particularly tough year for new listings given the market volatility. \u201cNasdaq is much bigger, so they\u2019re buying it to help support one of their growth initiatives,\u201d said Rich Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP. \u201cIt will help them as a breeding ground for new IPOs.\u201d Silbert declined to comment on the purchase price, deferring to Nasdaq, which also declined to disclose what it paid. SecondMarket and a bitcoin venture called Digital Currency Group were two subsidiaries of a holding company in which Silbert is chairman, he said. Silbert stepped down as CEO of SecondMarket in 2014 and has focused mainly on DGC since then, he said. Silbert said the deal validated his vision. SecondMarket rose to prominence as venture-backed technology companies gained in size and attention in recent years. One of SecondMarket\u2019s most attention-grabbing clients ever, Facebook Inc., used the service to trade shares before its $16 billion initial public offering on Nasdaq in May 2012. Twitter Inc., LinkedIn Corp. and Dropbox Inc. are among other tech companies that used SecondMarket.\xa0In February 2010, Singapore\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund Temasek Holding Pte and Hong Kong-based Li Ka-shing Foundation Ltd. together bought a combined 10 percent stake of Silbert\u2019s company for $15 million, valuing it at $150 million. The company was the biggest private market for buyers and sellers for Facebook shares for four years, a period that saw the social network\u2019s valuation driven up more than 10-fold to exceed $100 billion. Commissions on Facebook trading may have accounted for almost a third of SecondMarket\u2019s revenue in the last full year it was private, Bloomberg News reported in 2012. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of capital that\u2019s found its way from public market investors to the private market,\u201d Silbert said. \u201cSince the Facebook period on SecondMarket, companies have come to appreciate controlled liquidity, discreet liquidity, which can be a really good employee benefit. As the acceptance of staying private continues to grow, Nasdaq allows them to acquire the dominant position within a fast growing market segment.\u201d Silbert, who grew up in Gaithersburg, Maryland, has been a registered broker since he was 17. In 1986, his father, a government auditor, died from an aneurysm of the main artery of the heart, and Silbert pursued his odd jobs, including work at a liquor store and selling greeting cards, with even more determination, his mother Andrea Epstein told Bloomberg Markets magazine in 2011. He earned a degree from the Goizueta School of Business at Emory University in Atlanta and spent a summer at Bear Stearns Cos. As a 25-year-old banker at Houlihan Lokey, Silbert worked for the creditors of Enron Corp., traveling the globe after the firm\u2019s 2001 bankruptcy, flogging Enron assets, including fiber-optic cable and Bolivian pipelines. Silbert started an earlier iteration of what would become SecondMarket in 2004 with the help of a $300,0000 investment. For most of its existence, its main rival has been SharesPost Inc., which before today held a stake in Nasdaq Private Market. As Nasdaq bought SecondMarket, it also bought out SharesPost\u2019s stake for more than $10 million, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. \u201cThe market for private company shares now has two major players each serving a different market function,\u201d Greg Brogger, CEO and founder of SharesPost and the former president of Nasdaq Private Market, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cSharesPost is the pre-eminent liquidity provider for late-stage private growth companies and their shareholders. Nasdaq Private Market delivers software to issuers to run formal liquidity programs efficiently.\u201d The market that Brogger hopes to split with Nasdaq is only getting bigger. Startups are holding off from IPOs and staying private longer, with the number of closely held companies valued at more than $1 billion surging. There are now 142 of these so-called unicorns with a total valuation of $506 billion, according to CB Insights, a company that analyzes trends in venture capital. Unicorns also are getting created at a faster clip. In the first nine months of this year, the number of startups that raised money from the private market at a valuation of $1 billion or more rose to 58, according to CB Insights. That\u2019s up from 38 for all of 2014. Few of the unicorns created in 2014 went public this year. Many raised more private financing. That means there\u2019s a glut of cash-hungry private companies looking to buy and sell shares. The experience of companies that have gone public this year isn\u2019t likely to encourage others to follow. While Ferrari NV enjoyed a 5.8 percent gain in its first day of trading Wednesday, the Bloomberg IPO Index, which tracks businesses for a year after they go public, has dropped 18 percent in 2015. In the span of about a week earlier this month, Digicel Group Ltd. canceled a sale, First Data Corp. priced shares below a marketed range and Albertsons Cos. postponed an offering. \u201cAs the acceptance of staying private continues to grow, Nasdaq owning SecondMarket enables them to acquire the dominant position within a fast growing new market segment,\u201d Silbert said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going back to the days where a founder starts a company and they have to wait seven years before they see a dollar for their equity.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/SamMamudi', 'name': u'Sam Mamudi', 'twitterhandle': u'SamMamudi'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/silbert-s-secondmarket-joins-greifeld-s-private-market-in-deal', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 22, 22, 26, 28, 397000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Silbert's SecondMarket Joins Greifeld's Private Market in Deal"}, {'articleText': u'  California\u2019s business-regulation agency reversed course hours after saying the state wouldn\u2019t regulate digital currencies such as Bitcoin.

Blockstack, a San Francisco-based firm, has taken the underlying technology behind bitcoin transactions and adapted it for mainstream finance, including clearing and settlement, according to Peter Shiau, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer. A small group of banks have started beta testing Blockstack\u2019s technology. The new venture joins a field of companies including Nasdaq and Blythe Masters\u2019 Digital Asset Holdings LLC that are trying to use bitcoin\u2019s ledger, the blockchain, to streamline financial processes. Settlement -- the final transfer of assets following a trade -- currently takes place in two or three days. Blockchain advocates say they could whittle the process down to a few minutes or even seconds. While some see bitcoin as a challenge to currencies that are minted by nation states -- a practice that has prevailed since at least the heyday of the Roman Empire -- Blockstack\u2019s goal is more humble. It wants to speed up and cheapen financial companies\u2019 transactions while reducing errors. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to destroy banking or financial services as they are today,\u201d said Shiau, who previously worked at Standard Chartered Bank in product innovation. \u201cWe see what we\u2019re building as technology that can help improve the back-office infrastructure that financial institutions are using.\u201d Blockstack\u2019s team also includes Philip Harris, a former Nasdaq executive, as an adviser, and chief executive officer and founder Miron Cuperman, who used to work as a senior security engineer at Google. The company is raising funds and declined to identify its existing investors. It has fewer than 10 employees. Blockchain\u2019s record-keeping technology has come to be seen as potentially the most important part of the bitcoin innovation. Shiau has a PowerPoint presentation that likens the currency to Ford\u2019s Model T. He argues that the assembly line that produced the Tin Lizzy was more disruptive than the vehicle regarded as the world\u2019s first affordable car. The bitcoin network is open and decentralized. Digital currencies like bitcoin provide a reward to the computers on the network that run security and other processes. In a private network like Blockstack\u2019s, the reward isn\u2019t so important. A private system consists of a few known parties who are willing to provide computing power to create a secure common ledger. \u201cWhen you have this private blockchain that\u2019s shared by a number of financial institutions, all you\u2019re doing is just keeping records of the transactions and who owns what,\u201d Shiau said.  \u201cWhat\u2019s nice about the blockchain is you can do that in real time. There are no fees involved.\u201d Trading settlement is provided by companies such as CLS Group Holdings AG and Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. U.S. regulators see those firms as systemically important to the financial system. Europe is developing a pan-continental platform called Target 2 Securities to help tie its capital markets together. \u201cThis is technology that they can adopt,\u201d Shiau said.

All it takes is one good bet. That\u2019s the allure drawing traders to a pair of exchange-traded funds that take Russian stocks and triple their returns with leverage. Daily gains of more than 30 percent and the widest price swings among almost 1,500 U.S.-listed ETFs have fueled a 200 percent increase in shares outstanding in both of Direxion Investments\u2019 leveraged long and short funds since December, while trading volume has jumped more than five-fold. Russian stock volatility has surged as investors weigh the risks of international sanctions, plunging oil prices and potential conflict with the U.S. and its allies over Ukraine. Traders who anticipated December\u2019s surprise interest rate increase to stem a plunging ruble made 36 percent in a day going short, triple the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index\u2019s gain for all of 2014. Two months later, as officials from Moscow and Kiev signed a cease-fire deal, bullish investors reaped a 14 percent profit. \u201cWhen you have a leveraged ETF that\u2019s trading on an already extremely volatile Russian market, this becomes a trade for the brave of heart,\u201d Irene Bauer, the chief investment officer at Twenty20 Investments, which specializes in ETF portfolio solutions, said by phone on March 26. \u201cYou can see huge gains if you know all the ins and outs, but chances are high you can also lose a lot. It\u2019s a hit-or-miss ETF.\u201d While 30-day volatility on the dollar-denominated RTS Index of Russian stocks has receded since reaching a six-year high in January, price swings on the gauge remain the widest in the world after Greece, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s helped lure hedge funds including Arbiter Partners Capital Management LLC and CMT Trading to the Direxion ETFs. Hedge funds, largely unregulated pools of capital that can bet on falling as well as rising asset prices, account for more than half of publicly disclosed investments in the Direxion Daily Russia Bear 3x Shares ETF, and more than a quarter in the Direxion Daily Russia Bull 3x Shares fund, compared with 6 percent for SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, the world\u2019s largest exchange-traded fund. \u201cIf you were to assign movie ratings to ETFs, leveraged products would get a hard R rating,\u201d Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said by phone on March 27. \u201cThe volatility in this product right now is so high it makes Bitcoin look like Vanguard. They should be used by professionals only.\u201d Leveraged ETFs use swaps or derivatives to try to amplify daily index returns, in contrast with conventional funds designed to match the performance. They have come under scrutiny over several issues since 2009, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned that they were typically \u201cunsuitable\u201d as long-term investments in volatile markets. Regulators have urged caution in part because leveraged ETFs deliver the multiple on a one-day return, hence the word \u201cdaily\u201d in their names. This ultimately can produce higher-than-expected gains if the index moves in one direction over the long term. Reversals in the index\u2019s course, however, will lead to worse-than-anticipated returns for the funds relative to their leverage multiples. The larger the swings, the bigger the lag will be. The phenomenon explains how Direxion\u2019s leveraged bull ETF can be down 54 percent in the four months through Friday, while the bear version has plunged 33 percent. The long fund surged 8 percent at 9:31 a.m. in New York. \u201cThe complexity of leveraged exchange-traded funds coupled with the level of uncertainty over Russia makes me want to advise to think twice before investing in leveraged products that track Russian stocks,\u201d Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual-fund and exchange-traded fund research at S&P Capital IQ in New York said by phone March 25. \u201cThe risk can be too high.\u201d The stock volatility has been largely driven by traders reacting to developments in Ukraine, where the U.S. and its allies claim President Vladimir Putin is supporting a rebellion. Sanctions linked to the conflict combined with a drop in the price of oil, Russia\u2019s biggest export, are pushing the country toward its first recession since 2009, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. While the cease-fire is generally holding, government troops and separatist rebels have failed to demonstrate that they\u2019ve withdrawn heavy weapons from the conflict zone, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said last week. German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened Russia with more sanctions if the truce is seriously breached. Large price swings in the leveraged ETFs can fuel huge profits for investors actively monitoring market reactions to events and news in Russia, according to Sylvia Jablonski, Managing Director and co-head of Capital Markets and Institutional Strategy at Direxion Investments. \u201cThese products are for very quick and very knowledgeable traders that constantly monitor the market as well as the news headlines, and correct their positions,\u201d Jablonski said by phone on March 19. \u201cYou can have a significant return if you\u2019re on the right side of the trade.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-29/russia-and-leverage-are-powerful-mix-luring-hedge-funds-to-etfs', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 29, 18, 0, 1, 1000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Russia and Leverage Are Powerful Mix Luring Hedge Funds to ETFs'}, {'articleText': u'  Bank of Nova Scotia was Canada\u2019s top arranger of stock sales for the first time since 2002 after exclusively leading offerings for Manulife Financial Corp. and Veresen Inc. in a year fueled by energy financings.

Scotiabank, the country\u2019s third-biggest bank by assets, hasn\u2019t ranked higher than second since 2008. Bank of Montreal\u2019s BMO Capital Markets fell to third from second, with 51 sales for $4.28 billion. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was fourth with $3.9 billion of sales, edging past fifth-ranked Toronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s TD Securities by less than $1 million. The figures and rankings, which exclude preferred share sales and self-led deals, were current as of today and may change as more transactions are recorded. RBC, which ranked No. 1 for domestic stock sales seven times in the past decade, helped oversee some of last year\u2019s largest deals including Scotiabank\u2019s sale of C$2.62 billion ($2.25 billion) shares of CI Financial Corp. in May. Energy will likely play less of a role in stock sales this year, though issuance by consumer companies, retailers and industrial firms may pick up, said Kirby Gavelin, RBC\u2019s head of Canadian equity capital markets. \u201cCanadian equity new-issue finance may not be as high as what we saw last year, but we don\u2019t see it dropping by a major factor,\u201d Gavelin said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s M&A activity, expansion activity and other parts of the economy that have the potential to be more active than energy perhaps this year.\u201d Scotiabank had mandates including landing the sole bookrunner role for Manulife\u2019s sale of C$1.76 billion in subscription receipts in September, and Veresen\u2019s C$920 million sale of subscription receipts the same month. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a long history with these clients,\u201d said Scotia Capital\u2019s Lawrence Lewis, a vice chairman in equity capital markets. \u201cWe were able to get Manulife exceptionally tight terms, very good terms for the size required on a time-effective basis.\u201d Scotiabank\u2019s ties with Calgary-based Veresen, an owner of natural-gas pipelines, go back to the 1990s, when the bank took the company known then as Fort Chicago public. \u201cThe firm\u2019s had strong relationships, we\u2019ve done equity financings, preferred financings and we know the management well,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed us to be in a competitive position to sole lead these transactions.\u201d Five stock sales each raised more than C$1 billion, with Encana Corp.\u2019s C$2.6 billion September sale of its remaining stake in PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. topping the list. PrairieSky Royalty was also Canada\u2019s biggest IPO last year -- and the largest in the country since 2000 -- after Encana raised C$1.67 billion including an over-allotment in its May initial sale of its 46 percent stake. Companies raised $3.6 billion from 29 IPOs last year, the highest amount since 2010, with CIBC No.1 based on value with roles on PrairieSky, Northern Blizzard Resources Inc. and Journey Energy Inc. \u201cThe No. 1 ranking in IPOs is something that is absolutely essential to us,\u201d Benoit Lauze, CIBC\u2019s head of equity capital markets, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe IPO market leads to a lot of follow-on activity, typically, so this bodes very well for CIBC going forward given that we were bookrunner on most of the very large IPOs.\u201d Beyond energy, Catalyst Capital Group Inc. raised $264 million in an IPO of its Callidus Capital Corp. unit, while technology firms Kinaxis Inc. and Lumenpulse Inc. each raised about $105 million in IPOs last year. A more diverse group of companies, such as retailers, technology firms and those involved in consumer products, may tap public markets for the first time this year, Lauze said. \u201cRecent market volatility will certainly have an impact on equity new issue markets in 2015, with lower oil prices leading to lower oil and gas issuance,\u201d said Sante Corona, head of equity capital markets at TD Securities. \u201cThere are sectors that stand to benefit from lower oil prices and a weaker Canadian dollar, and we may see issuance from those sectors such as industrials or companies that sell into U.S. markets.\u201d IPO candidates include Inovent Capital Inc. and Canada Jetlines Ltd., which are marketing a C$50 million offering to fund a new \u201cultra-low cost\u201d airline out of Vancouver International Airport, according to company filings. And BitGold Inc. co-founder Roy Sebag said in a December interview that he aims to raise as much as C$20 million in a Toronto IPO within six months for a business that will enable customers to swap their holdings between gold bullion and bitcoins. Both of those deals would pale in comparison to any sale of part of Vale SA\u2019s base metals unit. After buying Canadian nickel producer Inco Ltd. eight years ago, the Brazilian miner said Dec. 2 it may sell a minority stake in the unit, valued as much as $35 billion. \u201cVale\u2019s been well broadcast and that could clearly come, as well as some of the unnamed senior mining companies who do have debt and will have to deleverage in this environment,\u201d Peter Miller, head of Canadian equity capital markets at BMO Capital Markets, said in an interview. \u201cThey could come with some chunky offerings.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-05/scotiabank-top-canada-equity-arranger-after-12-years', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 5, 22, 43, 48, 565000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Scotiabank Top Canada Equity Arranger After 12 Years'}, {'articleText': u'  SecondMarket Inc. said it participated in the U.S. government\u2019s third bitcoin auction to dispose of virtual currency seized by authorities when the illicit Silk Road online marketplace was shut down in 2013.

Bitcoins will be transferred to winner or winners on Monday at the earliest, the agency said. Interest in the digital currency remains healthy even though bitcoin prices have declined about 28 percent since the previous auction on Dec. 4, and are less than half of their value from a year earlier, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. Increased regulatory scrutiny and closures of some bitcoin businesses are weighing on prices, as are the auctions, according to Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. \u201cThe steady stream of supply provided by the U.S. Marshals auctions is likely causing some pressure on bitcoin prices because they are coming on top of the existing supply from miners,\u201d Luria said. \u201cOnce all the auctions are complete I would expect that overhang to lead to some price increases.\u201d Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper and online financial exchange SecondMarket won the 80,000 bitcoins auctioned off by the agency last year.

It\u2019s not the property market, where prices have started falling from record highs, or gold, which left him nursing two years of losses. Returns from trust products are too low, he says, and bitcoin is too risky after the virtual currency tumbled 48 percent from its December high through last week. For Chen\u2019s 50,000 yuan ($8,033) of investable cash, only initial public offerings will do. Chinese IPOs have jumped an average 43 percent in their trading debuts this year, the most worldwide, and have since extended those gains to 85 percent. Regulators are restarting the market after a four-month halt in new deals, with at least nine companies marketing their shares to investors last week. \u201cThis is probably the only good investment channel left in China,\u201d Chen, who plans to use borrowed money to amplify his bets, said in a June 16 phone interview. IPOs have become a bastion for Chinese speculators who watched many of their favorite wagers turn sour this year amid slowing credit growth, a Communist Party campaign against lavish spending and forecasts for the weakest economic expansion since 1990. Chinese home prices fell for the first time in almost two years in May, gold has tumbled 31 percent from its 2011 high through last week and the yuan slumped 2.8 percent versus the dollar this year. New loans by Chinese trusts, which get funding from individual investors, sank to a two-year low last month. In Macau, the top destination for mainland gamblers, casino revenue growth is slowing as authorities tighten currency controls. The Liv-ex 100 Fine Wine Index has plunged 32 percent from its 2011 high as China, the biggest importer of Bordeaux wines three years ago, cracked down on official gift giving. IPOs avoided the downturn in part because China\u2019s securities regulator has pressured companies to price the offerings at below-average valuations in an effort to protect small investors. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 4.2 percent this year through last week, extending its five-year retreat to 30 percent, as trading volumes slumped. The gauge slid 0.1 percent at the close today. Feitian Technologies Co., a Beijing-based maker of digital security devices, priced its shares on June 17 at 16.6 times reported earnings, less than the industry average of 52 times, according to its prospectus. Shandong Longda Meat Foodstuff Co., a pork producer, and Wuxi Xuelang Environmental Technology Co., which manufactures gas purification systems, also priced shares at valuations below the average level of peers. About 100 Chinese companies will sell shares in mainland IPOs by year-end, China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Xiao Gang said on May 19. The rally in Chinese IPOs in January and February is almost double the 26 percent advance for companies that listed globally outside of China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All 48 Chinese offerings rose on their first day, and all but two are still sitting on gains. \u201cIPO markets historically have been a great market to get in,\u201d Fraser Howie, a director at Newedge Singapore and co-author of \u201cRed Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China\u2019s Extraordinary Rise,\u201d said by phone on June 10. \u201cYou have the government controlling prices.\u201d Chinese IPOs have burned some investors who bought the shares after their first day of trading. Shaanxi Coal Industry Co., which jumped 14 percent in its Shanghai debut in January, has since lost 11 percent through last week as the company reported a 53 percent drop in first-quarter net income. Guirenniao Co., a maker of sports shoes, has tumbled 18 percent since its first day of trading on Jan. 24 after full-year profit slid 20 percent. \u201cIPOs are always good for a punt,\u201d Andy Xie, the former World Bank economist who\u2019s one of the 50 most influential people in global finance according to last year\u2019s ranking by Bloomberg Markets magazine, said in a phone interview on June 12. \u201cBut very few go up on their own merits.\u201d The CSRC is trying to curb speculation in new share offerings. The regulator halted IPO sales for at least a year through November to strengthen the quality of listed businesses and prevent investors from colluding to manipulate prices. Chinese exchanges will suspend trading in IPO shares for 30 minutes on their debut if moves exceed 10 percent from opening prices, and will cap gains or losses at 20 percent. Speculators have flocked to IPOs since the birth of the nation\u2019s exchanges in Shenzhen and Shanghai in the early 1990s. Shenzhen\u2019s sale of lottery tickets offering a chance to buy shares in August 1992 drew hundreds of thousands of investors to the southern city and sparked days of violence after application forms ran out. At the height of China\u2019s stock-market bubble in 2007, PetroChina Co. surged 163 percent in its trading debut, briefly making it the world\u2019s first $1 trillion company. The stock has since dropped 83 percent through last week. For Liu Xi, a 36-year-old hotel sales manager in Shanghai, the potential for big returns on IPOs, and a lack of profitable alternatives, makes them worth the risks. Liu plans to invest 100,000 yuan in new share offerings, switching from wealth management products. WMPs and trusts, which typically offer a fixed return by pooling investor funds to make loans, have lost some of their appeal as slowing economic growth raises default risks and authorities seek to restrain a surge in credit that began with a government stimulus package during the global financial crisis in 2008. While the central bank cut reserve ratio requirements for some lenders this month, President Xi Jinping said in May the nation needs to adapt to a \u201cnew normal\u201d slower pace of expansion. The International Monetary Fund called on China this month to refrain from implementing more stimulus. Chen, the accountant who works for a state-owned property and logistics company, said he expects at least 10 percent returns from his IPO investments. And he shows no signs of worrying about the kind of losses he suffered in gold. \u201cSuch a return is pretty secure,\u201d Chen said.

The case was the first to determine whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed the lawsuit, has the authority to regulate transactions in virtual currency, according to a lawyer for the defendant, Trendon Shavers. U.S. Magistrate Judge Amos L. Mazzant in Sherman, Texas, agreed with the SEC that Bitcoin Savings and Trust, operated by Shavers from his home in McKinney, Texas, was a Ponzi scheme. Prosecutors have pursued other high-profile Bitcoin cases, including one against ex-Bitcoin Foundation vice chairman Charlie Shrem, who this month plead guilty to charges tied to the \u201cSilk Road\u201d illicit online bazaar. Shrem admitted to working with another man who operated an underground Bitcoin exchange service and who also pleaded guilty. In another case alleging that a Florida man used Bitcoins for money laundering, a state judge in March rejected a defense argument that he did nothing illegal because the digital currency isn\u2019t money. Shavers solicited investors\u2019 Bitcoins and falsely claimed that he traded the currency against the U.S. dollar to generate average weekly returns of 10.65 percent. In reality, Mazzant wrote, Shavers used new Bitcoins to pay for withdrawals or his personal use. The investments Shavers sold \u201cmeet the definition of investment contract and, as such, are securities, giving the court jurisdiction over this case,\u201d Mazzant said in the Sept. 18 order. \u201cShavers\u2019 blatant misuse and misrepresentations of the Bitcoin Savings and Trust investors\u2019 bitcoins, even as he publicly denied the Ponzi scheme\u201d on online forums \u201cevidences his intent to deceive, manipulate and defraud.\u201d Shavers argued the investments weren\u2019t securities because Bitcoin isn\u2019t money, and can\u2019t be regulated by the U.S. He claimed no money ever exchanged hands in the transaction at issue, according to a court filing. Shavers didn\u2019t immediately respond to a call seeking comment on the ruling. The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Francisco Gonzalez, who has been warning for almost a decade of the technological transformation set to engulf the financial industry, said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Wednesday that his bank would define itself as a software company. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA has spent about 3.2 billion euros ($3.6 billion) on technology since 2011 to expand online and mobile-banking services and prepare for what Gonzalez has described as an existential threat from firms like Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon Inc. \u201cThe greater part of banks -- thousands of banks -- is going to disappear slowly in coming years,\u201d he said last month at BBVA\u2019s earnings press conference. When one of the Internet giants jumps into banking, \u201cmany people are going to realize what we\u2019re talking about, that there\u2019s a revolution going on,\u201d said Gonzalez, 70, who declined to comment for this article. The bank is investing in financial technology firms such as Coinbase Inc., a provider of digital wallets for spending and receiving bitcoins, and cloud computing startup Madiva Soluciones. Last year it bought Portland, Oregon-based Simple in a deal valuing the digital banking company at $117 million. \u201cWe are turning a bank into a digital house -- it\u2019s a long journey,\u201d Gonzalez said today. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right tools, you can\u2019t compete.\u201d The investments differentiate BBVA from competitors, even if they haven\u2019t made much difference to the bottom line yet, said Arturo Bris, a professor at the Lausanne-based IMD business school. \u201cThe future is about big data, bitcoin, so many things that we don\u2019t even know if they exist now,\u201d Bris said by phone. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a direct impact on the bank\u2019s results, that will take time to happen, but it will happen.\u201d Angel Cano, BBVA\u2019s chief operating officer, attributed a drop in costs at the Spanish unit last year in part to the bank\u2019s digital push. Not everyone is persuaded the effort will bear fruit. \u201cSo far, this is the only tangible benefit of the bank\u2019s digital strategy,\u201d said David Vaamonde, an analyst at MainFirst Bank in Madrid who rates the stock neutral. \u201cIn our view, the market is still somewhat skeptical of what the bet on technology will mean for BBVA.\u201d As long as Gonzalez is in charge, the push will continue. He\u2019s been chairman since 2000 and has said he\u2019ll stay at the helm until the digital transformation is well underway. Banco Santander SA, the largest Spanish lender, has begun talking about its own digital ambitions. Chairman Ana Botin, 54, who took over from her father last year, said at her first annual earnings presentation in February that she wants to transform Santander into a technological player. More than half of CEOs at banks and capital-market firms see tech companies and other financial newcomers as a threat, almost double the portion last year, according to an annual survey published by PwC last month. In remarks last year, Gonzalez said the important decisions in digital banking were made seven years before, when BBVA began its transformation. He likened the emergence of new digital companies to the so-called Cambrian Explosion about 540 million years ago when life forms on earth multiplied and evolved rapidly. BBVA set up a digital banking division last year, headed by Carlos Torres Vila, to use technology to make the bank more efficient and increase its appeal to consumers. The bank has an innovation center in a former palace in Madrid where business strategists sit in open workspaces near film-set style models of shops and streets that simulate environments where customers are using the bank\u2019s services. Part of the bank\u2019s effort is to mine data gathered from customers to target them with products and services, without breaching client confidentiality. \u201cAny major bank will be able to buy technology, but if you are ahead on the learning curve like BBVA is you will know how to apply it,\u201d said Ricardo Wehrhahn, a Madrid-based managing partner at Intral Strategy Execution, a banking and business consultant.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/banker-leading-digital-push-to-fend-off-google-facebook', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 3, 19, 0, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Banker Leading Digital Push to Fend Off Google, Facebook'}, {'articleText': u'  Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in Japan saying about $470 million in Bitcoins belonging to its customers and the firm were missing. \u201cThe company believes there is a high possibility that the Bitcoins were stolen,\u201d Mt. Gox said in a statement. The filing yesterday follows three weeks of speculation about the fate of the Tokyo-based exchange, which suspended withdrawals on Feb. 7. Since Bitcoins exist as bits of software, they can be stolen if a hacker gains access to the computers and servers used to run online exchanges, where the virtual currency can be traded for dollars, euros and other currencies. Investors and entrepreneurs were left asking how the exchange serving digital currency traders could become insolvent, how the encrypted coins could be pilfered and how the fledgling Bitcoin industry can bounce back. \u201cMt. Gox is the only exchange that wasn\u2019t backed by venture funds or institutional investors,\u201d Micky Malka, the founder of Palo Alto, California-based Ribbit Capital and a Bitcoin investor, said in an interview. \u201cIt will take time for the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem to prove that this is a bad apple and not a problem of the entire ecosystem.\u201d Bitcoin was down almost 4 percent to $553.91 at 5:03 p.m. New York time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Mt. Gox, which had revenue of 135 million yen ($1.33 million) in the year ended March, applied in Tokyo District Court today for bankruptcy protection with debt exceeding assets by 2.7 billion yen, the exchange said in a statement. Mt. Gox lost 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own, for a total of 850,000, the company said. \u201cWe are in a situation close to what you would call Chapter 11 in the U.S.,\u201d Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an e-mail yesterday. Karpeles said his company lost the Bitcoins because of weaknesses in its computer systems\u2019 security measures. Since Bitcoins exist as software, any computer or server connected to the Internet that stores those files is vulnerable to unauthorized access. Similar to a hacker copying e-mail, a thief can steal the virtual currency by duplicating the digital security key that lets a user spend it. A standard method of keeping Bitcoins safe is to move the digital money off a Web-connected computer, according to Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer for Blockchain.info, a company that hosts online wallets for Bitcoin storage. An exchange or any other company handling large quantities of Bitcoins could save the bulk of them on a device that isn\u2019t connected to the Internet, an arrangement known as \u201ccold storage.\u201d Mt. Gox probably failed to properly manage its online and offline Bitcoins, Antonopoulos said. Any individual or business can protect Bitcoins by physically moving the software between cold storage, and online, or hot storage, using flash drives. \u201cCold storage is a combination of technology and operational process,\u201d Antonopoulos said in an e-mail yesterday. \u201cThey got some part of that wrong.\u201d Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has since gained traction with merchants around the world. The digital currency has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify transactions. Akio Shinomiya, a lawyer for Mt. Gox, said yesterday the court will notify creditors identified by the exchange in its bankruptcy filing. Other creditors will have to make a claim themselves, and then the court would decide who gets repaid. The company also set up a call center to answer customers\u2019 questions about the bankruptcy. Companies from San Francisco to London as well as the virtual currency\u2019s industry group, the Bitcoin Foundation, have been seeking to assure Bitcoin users that their funds won\u2019t disappear due to theft or mismanagement. U.S. and Japanese prosecutors have opened investigations into events leading to the shutdown and bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, and U.S. regulators are exploring options for increasing regulation of virtual currencies. The European Banking Authority, set up in 2011 to harmonize banking rules across the 28-member European Union, said yesterday that it would set up a task force in the first half of this year to review options for regulating Bitcoin and Bitcoin derivatives. One Bitcoin user yesterday filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in federal court in Chicago, seeking to represent U.S. customers who lost money. \u201cThis catastrophic loss has not only revealed the instability of a burgeoning new industry, it has also uncovered a massive scheme to defraud millions of consumers into providing a private company with real, paper money in exchange for virtual currency,\u201d Illinois resident Gregory Greene said in the complaint.

The currency still faces problems around legitimacy, Hope said. \u201cThey are being used to buy things like arms and drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect tax isn\u2019t being paid on Bitcoin transactions.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-05/lenders-may-create-bitcoin-rivals-says-new-zealand-bank-group', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 5, 5, 4, 57, 42, 397000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Lenders May Create Bitcoin Rivals, Says New Zealand Bank Group'}, {'articleText': u'  The Silk Road website, before being shut this week by the U.S., was a cyber-bazaar of the criminal underworld that connected buyers and sellers of heroin, cocaine and hacking services. It combined EBay-style customer reviews and shipping tips with an open disregard for the law. \u201cWe are happy to announce a new category in the marketplace called Forgeries,\u201d the site\u2019s alleged 29-year-old overseer, who called himself Dread Pirate Roberts, said in a message posted Aug. 5, 2011, according to a criminal complaint in Manhattan federal court. \u201cIn this category, you will find offers for forged, government issued documents including fake IDs and passports.\u201d U.S. agents arrested the man they believe is Dread Pirate Roberts and seized the site, describing it in the complaint unsealed yesterday as \u201cthe most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet.\u201d Silk Road used Bitcoin digital currency to generate the equivalent of $1.2 billion in illicit sales and take in $80 million in commissions in less than three years, according to the complaint. \u201cHigh quality #4 heroin all rock directly from key,\u201d read one pitch cited in the complaint. The listing bore a photo of alleged heroin chunks. The seller, listed as gotsitall 5.0, promised Monday shipping in vacuum-sealed packages for next-day delivery. \u201cAMAZING products at more than reasonable prices,\u201d wrote one reviewer. \u201cHis customer support is some of the best I have ever encountered.\u201d Prosecutors allege Ross William Ulbricht, 29, was Dread Pirate Roberts, or DPR, and operated Silk Road from January 2011 until last month. Ulbricht handled the routine personnel matters faced by any small-business man, according to electronic communications reviewed by federal agents. And he availed himself of some of the services his site facilitated. He contracted with one of the site\u2019s users to kill another user, according to the complaint. Separately, Ulbricht was indicted in federal court in Baltimore for allegedly trying to arrange the murder of one of his employees who he feared might be a witness against him. The FBI, which tracked Ulbricht down using online gumshoe methods to thwart his Internet crimes, views him as the John Gotti of cybercrime, referring to the late New York organized crime boss. The allegations underscore the difficulty of patrolling the Internet for crime. Ulbricht allegedly used a hidden computer network that shielded users from law enforcement on servers run by unwitting third parties around the globe. Ulbricht rented the equipment using fake identification documents, prosecutors said. These arrangements, with the requirement that users pay in the Bitcoins, added to the anonymity of the transactions, as did users\u2019 fake identities and encrypted messages. Federal agents seized Bitcoins worth $3.6 million from accounts at the site, according to Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The seizure came days after New York\u2019s top banking regulator called for transparency in who makes trades in the nascent Bitcoin industry. \u201cVirtual currencies may ultimately turn out to be a very big thing that people want to use,\u201d Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services said in an interview. \u201cRight now, it feels as if the major advantage they\u2019re providing is anonymity. We\u2019ve learned over the years that if you see huge international transactions over the Internet, anonymous, it can often become a haven for money launderers, terrorists.\u201d The value of Bitcoin currency listed on the Bitstamp Ltd. exchange fell as much as 33 percent yesterday on news of the charges. Bitcoin prices had been unstable for months, dropping by more than 70 percent in the spring, to about $60. Since being introduced four years ago by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become popular way to pay for goods and services on the Internet, with 11.8 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks the digital currency\u2019s activity. Ulbricht\u2019s business, which prosecutors called \u201ca sprawling black-market bazaar,\u201d had almost 13,000 listings in late September for illegal drugs. They included categories for cannabis, dissociatives, ecstasy, intoxicants, opioids, precursors, psychedelics and stimulants, according to the complaint. Under its \u201cservices\u201d heading, users could hire computer hackers, buy instructions for hacking cash machines or obtain a list of black market contacts to obtain anonymous bank accounts, counterfeit money, guns, stolen credit card information and hit men. A \u201cseller\u2019s guide\u201d on the site advised users to vacuum-seal packages containing drugs to evade drug-detection dogs and machines. \u201cThe site has sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the Internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites,\u201d the government said in a civil forfeiture complaint filed Sept. 30 in federal court in Manhattan and unsealed yesterday. Ulbricht graduated from the University of Texas with a physics degree in 2006, according to the complaint. He then attended graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania School of Materials Science and Engineering from 2006 to 2010. He employed a small staff of administrators, whom he paid an average of $1,000 to $2,000 a week to help operate the site, FBI Agent Christopher Tarbell said in the complaint against Ulbricht. The administrators filed weekly reports on their activities, asked him for guidance in dealing with user inquiries and sought permission before taking leave. Ulbricht ran Silk Road on \u201cThe Onion Router\u201d or \u201cTor\u201d network, an Internet network designed to hide the identities of users by making it almost impossible to identify computers used to access or host websites. Beginning in November 2011, undercover agents seeking to make a case against Ulbricht made more than 100 drug purchases, including ecstasy, cocaine, heroin and LSD, from Silk Road vendors. They also found evidence of more serious criminal conduct involving talk of murder. In March, a Silk Road vendor known as FriendlyChemist told Ulbricht through the site\u2019s private message system that he had a list of the real names and addresses of Silk Road vendors and customers, which he obtained by hacking into the computer of another vendor, according to the complaint. Prosecutors said FriendlyChemist threatened to publish the information unless Ulbricht paid him $500,000. He said he needed to pay off his drug suppliers, according to the complaint. Using his pirate code name, Ulbricht corresponded with a Silk Road user called redandwhite, who said he represented the people owed money by FriendlyChemist. \u201cIn my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn\u2019t mind if he was executed,\u201d Ulbricht said on March 27, according to the complaint. He provided FriendlyChemist\u2019s name and address in White Rock, British Columbia, noting \u201cWife +3 kids.\u201d Ulbricht paid $150,000 to redandwhite to have FriendlyChemist killed, according to the complaint. Tarbell said Canadian law enforcement authorities had no record of any Canadian resident with the name that Ulbricht, as Dread Pirate Roberts, had passed on to redandwhite nor any record of a homicide in White Rock at the time. Ulbricht wasn\u2019t charged in that alleged murder-for-hire scheme. Yesterday, Ulbricht was charged in federal court in Manhattan with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. If convicted, he may face life in prison. He made an initial appearance in a five-minute proceeding yesterday in federal court in San Francisco. Ulbricht said he can\u2019t afford an attorney and was assigned a federal public defender. He remains in custody. Separately, Ulbricht was accused in the indictment in Baltimore of trying to have one of his administrators killed to prevent him from talking to police. In January, Ulbricht communicated with an undercover federal agent who posed as a drug trafficker, saying the employee, who wasn\u2019t identified in the indictment unsealed yesterday, had stolen money from Silk Road users and had been arrested. \u201cI\u2019d like him beat up, then forced to send the Bitcoins he stole back,\u201d Ulbricht allegedly said in a message. \u201cLike sit him down at his computer and make him do it.\u201d Later, Ulbricht asked the undercover agent: \u201cCan you change the order to execute rather than torture?\u201d according to the indictment. Ulbricht paid $80,000 for the employee\u2019s murder, saying he feared the employee would give information to law enforcement, according to prosecutors. The undercover agent sent Ulbricht a staged photograph to make it appear the employee had been murdered, they said. \u201cI\u2019m pissed I had to kill him ... but what\u2019s done is done,\u201d Ulbricht said, according to the indictment. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe he was so stupid. I just wish more people had some integrity.\u201d The criminal case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 13-mg-023287; the civil forfeiture case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 13-cv-06919, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The Maryland case is U.S. v.

New York will \u201clikely have to proceed with issuing some form of specially tailored BitLicense that adapts those rules to the world of virtual currency,\u201d Lawsky said. He said on Jan. 27 that his agency will propose regulations this year. At hearings Lawsky held on Jan. 28, law-enforcement officials called for the state to impose tough anti-money-laundering rules on digital currency businesses. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. urged \u201cenhanced due diligence\u201d for Bitcoin exchanges beyond what is required for banks. New York is considering a system that piggybacks on existing federal regulations on money laundering without making its own separate set of rules, Lawsky said in an interview after his speech. The key, he said, will be \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d rules that demand digital-currency businesses be cognizant of clients\u2019 suspicious activity, combined with the public record of transactions that is part of Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology. That approach \u201cis not overbearing but gives law enforcement what it needs,\u201d Lawsky said in the interview. The Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said in March that virtual-currency businesses may be regulated as money transmitters, and that they should register with Fincen, as it is known. Since states license such companies, the decision set off a rush by states to decide how to treat the embryonic industry. Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, has no central issuing authority and uses a public ledger to verify transactions that are authenticated by encrypted signatures. It is accepted by merchants selling legitimate products while also being used in illegal transactions. Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the Fincen director, said at the Washington conference that \u201cmany virtual currency exchanges\u201d haven\u2019t registered with the network. Companies that have are \u201cdoing a great job\u201d in reporting suspicious transactions, a central requirement of U.S. money-laundering rules. Calvery also said that even individuals who exchange dollars for Bitcoin privately for customers they meet online may need to register with Fincen. \u201cEssentially you\u2019re taking money from the public and giving them value in return,\u201d she said. Two men Florida men were arrested Feb. 6 on money-laundering charges after allegedly selling Bitcoin to undercover police officers who told them the digital currency would be used to buy stolen credit-card numbers. The officers said they found the men through a website called LocalBitcoins.com. Lawsky said in his Washington comments that the department will probably include \u201ca strong set of specially tailored, model consumer-disclosure rules\u201d for digital currency firms. For example, consumers should be aware that Bitcoin transactions are generally irreversible, he said. Traditional money transmitters such as Western Union Co. and MoneyGram International Inc. also have to follow rules on safety and soundness, including requirements that they hold capital buffers to ensure they can handle unexpected shocks. They are also limited in which kinds of investments they can make with customer money. New York is also considering whether licenses should be limited to digital currencies that have public ledgers, and whether there should be limits on technology that makes transactions anonymous, Lawsky said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-12/lawsky-says-new-york-to-adapt-existing-rules-for-bitcoin', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 12, 5, 1, 0, 17000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Lawsky Says New York to Adapt Existing Rules for Bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u'  Liberty Reserve SA, whose operators are charged with running a scheme that masked more than $6 billion of criminal proceeds, was designed to help users evade scrutiny, U.S. prosecutors said. The digital currency company, unlike traditional banks or legitimate online payment processors, didn\u2019t require users to validate their identity and allowed accounts to be opened under fictitious names such as \u201cRussia Hackers\u201d and \u201cHacker Account,\u201d according to prosecutors. An undercover agent was able to establish a Liberty Reserve account using the alias \u201cJoe Bogus,\u201d listing his address as \u201c123 Fake Main Street\u201d in \u201cCompletely Made Up City, New York,\u201d said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. He said the prosecution is believed to be the largest money-laundering case brought by the U.S. Liberty Reserve, incorporated in Costa Rica in 2006, operated as \u201cessentially a black-market bank,\u201d Bharara said yesterday at a news conference announcing the unsealing of an indictment against the company and seven principals. The company, which operated as one of the world\u2019s most widely used digital currency services, \u201cfacilitated global criminal conduct\u201d and was created and structured \u201cas a criminal business venture, one designed to help criminals conduct illegal transactions,\u201d Bharara said. Liberty Reserve, shut by the U.S. through criminal and civil enforcement actions, helped users launder illegal proceeds from crimes or transfer funds among associates, prosecutors said. Liberty Reserve\u2019s digital currency was used by people committing identity theft, credit card fraud, computer hacking, child pornography and narcotics trafficking, prosecutors said. Liberty Reserve had an estimated 1 million users around the world and conducted a total of about 55 million transactions -- virtually all of them illegal -- including 200,000 in the U.S., Bharara said. U.S. investigators have found that criminal rings that used Liberty Reserve to distribute illicit proceeds operated from Vietnam, Nigeria, Hong Kong, China and the U.S. \u201cIts entire existence was based on a criminal business model,\u201d Bharara said at the news conference. \u201cThe global enforcement action that we announced today is an important step toward reining in the Wild West of illicit Internet banking,\u201d he said yesterday. \u201cAs detailed in the indictment, Liberty Reserve was intentionally created and structured to facilitate criminal activity.\u201d Officials said the case was a series of firsts for U.S. authorities. In addition to being the largest international money-laundering case brought by the Justice Department, it involved the first search warrant executed by American officials against a cloud-based server. Bharara said 30 search warrants were executed during an 18-month investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re now entering the cyber age of money-laundering,\u201d said Richard Weber, chief of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Criminal Investigation division, who also alluded to Chicago Crime boss Al Capone. \u201cIf Al Capone were alive today, this is how he would be hiding his money.\u201d The company operated one of the world\u2019s most widely used digital currencies, allowing users to send and receive \u201cinstant, real-time currency,\u201d according to the indictment in federal court in Manhattan. Digital currency, such as Bitcoin, was developed as a way to make anonymous transfers over the Internet without paying fees to a bank. The U.S. Justice Department warned as early as 2008 that criminals would increasingly rely on the digital currency industry to launder and move funds because it facilitates financial transactions outside the rules of the traditional banking system. The alleged crimes involved only Liberty Reserve and its operators, and not any other digital currency, Bharara said. Yesterday\u2019s actions \u201crelate only to Liberty Reserve and no other system,\u201d Bharara said. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking any position on virtual currency generally and we\u2019re not taking any position with respect to any particular other company that engages in something that may look on the surface that something that Liberty Reserve was doing.\u201d The U.S. charged seven people, including operators and owners of Liberty Reserve, and alleged that two defendants, Arthur Budovsky, 39, of Costa Rica and Vladimir Kats, 41, of Brooklyn, New York, previously ran a company called Golden Age Inc. that functioned as an exchange for \u201cE-Gold.\u201d The two men were convicted in New York state court in December 2006 for operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, Bharara\u2019s office said. Budovsky then moved to Costa Rica where he and another defendant, Ahmed Yassine Abdelghani, 46, incorporated Liberty Reserve that year, the U.S. alleged. Kats helped operate Liberty Reserve until 2009, prosecutors said in the indictment. Liberty Reserve \u201cgrew exponentially,\u201d prosecutors said, and eventually the company became \u201cthe predominant digital form of money laundering used by cyber criminals worldwide.\u201d Five people tied to the case were arrested on May 24, including Budovsky, who was arrested in Spain and is the principal founder of Liberty Reserve, the U.S. said. Kats, the co-founder of Liberty Reserve, was arrested in Brooklyn, prosecutors said. Azzeddine El Amine, 46, of Costa Rica, a principal deputy to Budovsky, was arrested in Spain, the U.S. said. Mark Marmilev, 33, of Brooklyn and Maxim Chukharev, 27, of Costa Rica, who helped designed and maintained the operation\u2019s technological infrastructure, were arrested in Brooklyn and Costa Rica respectively, Bharara\u2019s office said. Two others, Abdelghani and Allan Esteban Hidalgo Jimenez, 28, of Costa Rica, are fugitives who remain at large in Costa Rica, Bharara\u2019s office said. The indictment includes a count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business. The seven individual defendants are all charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a term of as long as 20 years in prison. The U.S. also seized five domain names tied to Liberty Reserve and the domain names of four exchanger websites that were controlled by the defendants. The U.S. also has filed civil actions and seized accounts tied to the defendants. At least 45 bank accounts with a total of $25 million have been restrained or seized, Bharara said yesterday. A related civil action was filed by the U.S. against 35 exchanger websites seeking the forfeiture of the exchanger\u2019s domain names over claims they were used to facilitate the money laundering conspiracy. David Cohen, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence for the U.S. Treasury Department, yesterday said at the press conference in Manhattan that Treasury officials have issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would prohibit U.S. financial institutions from maintaining accounts for foreign banks that process transactions involving Liberty Reserve, cutting it off from the U.S. financial system. He said it was the first use of certain provisions in the U.S. Patriot Act against a digital currency provider. \u201cWe took this action because Liberty Reserve, a web-based money transfer system or virtual currency, is being exploited by criminals worldwide to store, transfer and launder the proceeds of a wide variety of illegal activity,\u201d Cohen said yesterday. The action doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. is attempting to eliminate virtual currencies and their providers, he said. \u201cBut where, as here, an online money transmitter is deliberately designed to avoid regulatory scrutiny and tailors its services to illicit actors looking to launder their ill-gotten gains, Treasury will act to prevent abuse of the financial system,\u201d Cohen said. The Patriot Act gives Treasury a range of such options to protect the U.S. financial system from money laundering and terrorist financing risks, the department said. Bitcoin was developed as a digital currency in 2009. It was described on its website as a new form of money using cryptography \u201cto control its creation and transactions, rather than relying on central authorities.\u201d This month, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security seized a financial account with online payment processor Dwolla, registered in the name of a unit of Mt. Gox, the world\u2019s largest exchange of cyber currency, according to a warrant signed by a federal judge in Baltimore on May 14. Requesting the warrant, a special agent of the department said he had cause to believe the account was part of an unlicensed money transfer business. Law enforcement officials alleged that the company was engaged in a money-service business without first registering with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. While virtual currency does log each transaction centrally, no national government regulates it. The case is U.S. v.

The digital currency is currently trading at $566 on London-based Bitstamp and for $553 on BTC-e in Bulgaria.

Those governments have sought to ban or limit the use of the virtual currency, which exists as software and isn\u2019t controlled by any authority. \u201cSince traders can\u2019t get their Bitcoin out of Mt.Gox right now, the price is discounting a probability that they will never be able to get their Bitcoin out,\u201d  Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., wrote in an e-mail. The inability to remove funds from Mt.Gox is raising concerns that hackers might have gained access to deposits, Luria said. Other exchanges were crippled by a Internet-wide hacking attack that shut down marketplaces across the Web this month. Some have since resumed operations. Mt.Gox didn\u2019t return repeated requests by e-mail and phone for comment. The company also said in the statement that it had relocated its office due to security concerns. \u201cThe move, combined with some other security and technical challenges, pushed back our progress,\u201d Mt.Gox said in the statement. Kolin Burges of Britain flew from London to Tokyo on Feb. 13 and has been protesting outside the Mt.Gox headquarters since then.

Mt.Gox, one of the largest online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars, euros and other currencies, has had other stumbles. Mt.Gox temporarily halted or delayed withdrawals several times last year. While Bitcoins can be used to buy everything from Tesla Motors Inc. cars to Gummi bears, they have also become a speculative investment, with the price soaring to more than $1,200 last year from $12 at the beginning of 2013 as it gained mainstream attention. John Beltzer, 54, said he plans to grab his eight Bitcoins and close out his account at Mt. Gox as soon as he can. Beltzer, who runs a charity called Songs of Love Foundation, said he was told by Mt.Gox that hackers penetrated his account.

A denial-of-service attack, in which a website is flooded with massive requests for data, obstructed Bitstamp\u2019s ability to check account balances, the exchange said in a statement. Customers can withdraw cash but not Bitcoins, as the company works to fix services, Nejc Kodric, Bitstamp\u2019s chief executive officer, wrote in an e-mail.

No funds were lost and transactions that failed on Feb. 10 and 11 will be canceled, Bitstamp said. \u201cThis is a nuisance attack,\u201d said Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer for Blockchain.info, a provider of online wallets for a digital currencies. \u201cFunds have not been lost, and have not been affected. What it\u2019s done is slow down their accounting system from reconciling transactions.\u201d Bitcoins can be used to buy goods and services on Web stores and retail outlets. Non-profit thrift store operator Goodwill will be able to offer the option for stores to accept Bitcoins in some locations via payment terminals from Revel Systems Inc., the company said yesterday. The governments of India, China and Russia have sought to ban or limit the use of Bitcoins, which exist as software and aren\u2019t controlled by any central authority. Some U.S.-based exchanges have either closed at the behest of law enforcement or had difficulties obtaining business bank accounts due to regulatory concerns. The latest attack exploits a design element of Bitcoin, which exists as software. Since transactions need to be tracked and reconciled within the currency itself, any data disruption makes it difficult for exchanges and other service providers to follow the flow of the digital money. Coinbase Inc., a Bitcoin wallet operator, said that customers can still send and receive funds, although the attack, which affects the Bitcoin ecosystem as whole, is causing some delays in transactions. Some websites, as well as users of Bitcoin wallet software, will have to update their programs with fixes to prevent future attacks, according to Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin software developer. \u201cEven the designer of the system and other developers were unaware of how the system could be changed,\u201d Garzik said in an interview. \u201cAll of the wallets will need some level of updates.\u201d The denial-of-service attack against Bitstamp was small, and probably originated from one rogue computer, Garzik said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-11/bitcoin-exchange-bitstamp-halts-withdrawals', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 12, 18, 25, 30, 690000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Exchange Bitstamp Halts Customer Withdrawals'}, {'articleText': u'  Virtual-currency firms should face regulations that are tougher than those for established financial-services providers because of their ability to hide criminal activity, according to law enforcement officials. \u201cWithout stronger government oversight, we are allowing cybercriminals, identity thieves, traffickers of child pornography, and other malevolent actors to operate in a digital Wild West,\u201d Cyrus Vance Jr., the district attorney for Manhattan, said at a hearing yesterday about possible state regulation of digital currencies. Investors and entrepreneurs who spoke a day earlier at the first session of the hearings urged lighter regulation for startups. Yesterday, Vance and Richard Zabel, the deputy U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, recommended the opposite approach. The two days of hearings were convened by Benjamin Lawsky, the New York State superintendent of financial services. \u201cOne aspiration with Bitcoin is for it to be a main artery of the commercial world,\u201d Zabel said. \u201cIts intrinsic qualities mean it needs to be treated differently.\u201d The prosecutors cited illegal activity linked to digital currencies, the potential for tax evasion and technologies that can be used to obscure transactions as dangers for law enforcement. They dismissed industry arguments that their successful investigation of several criminal networks demonstrates that criminal activity is under control. On Jan. 27, federal prosecutors indicted a prominent figure among Bitcoin entrepreneurs, Charlie Shrem, for alleged money laundering linked to Silk Road, a Bitcoin-driven website allegedly used for buying drugs and other illicit goods. After closing the site in October, authorities said their probe is \u201congoing.\u201d Bitcoin, a software protocol for issuing and moving money across the Internet, has gained traction with merchants selling everything from Sacramento Kings basketball tickets to kitchen mixers on Overstock.com. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twins who created a fund to invest in Bitcoin price swings and who testified on the hearings\u2019 first day, say it may be an alternative to the global payment system currently dominated by companies such as Visa Inc., Western Union Co. and large banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. The price of Bitcoin rose less than 1 percent yesterday to $837.26 at 6:45 p.m. New York time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Federal regulators in March said Bitcoin-related businesses can be handled as state-licensed money transmitters -- a category that includes Western Union -- triggering a race by states to assess their own rules. Only New York has publicly contemplated rules specifically for virtual-currency companies -- what Lawsky has called a \u201cBitLicense\u201d -- and its steps could set the tone for other states. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has since become a global sensation. It has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify transactions while preserving users\u2019 anonymity. Vance endorsed the idea of requiring digital currency firms to obtain state money-transmitter licenses, while warning that such \u201caction in and of itself may not be enough.\u201d He said businesses that swap Bitcoin for traditional currency, for example, should have to conduct \u201cenhanced due diligence\u201d on customers. Fred Ehrsam, the chief executive of Coinbase, a San Francisco-based digital currency exchange, said at the hearing that customers are usually willing to provide identifying information and that preventing illegal activity is crucial. \u201cGenerally speaking, regulation could be a positive thing in this regard,\u201d Ehrsam said at yesterday\u2019s session, while warning against regulations that might \u201cfundamentally inhibit the power of the Bitcoin network.\u201d Jeremy Allaire, chief executive of Circle Internet Financial Inc., which promotes use of Bitcoin for retail transactions, urged states to coordinate their regulatory efforts. \u201cWe believe that there should be more guidance specifically geared toward digital currency firms and that the states should develop a streamlined approach to licensing these firms,\u201d Allaire said at the hearing. At a Bloomberg Government lunch in Washington yesterday, Bitcoin Foundation General Counsel Patrick Murck said regulators need to clarify where digital currency falls into their rules and \u201ctake a breather\u201d to see how the existing rules pan out before creating new ones. Vance and Zabel harshly criticized the use of Bitcoin \u201ctumblers,\u201d which accept a Bitcoin payment, and return the same amount with a new digital trail, obscuring its source. The process, which some virtual-currency enthusiasts embrace for privacy reasons, is sometimes called a \u201cBitcoin laundry.\u201d \u201cIn the cases I have seen they serve no other purpose than automated money laundering and identity concealers,\u201d Zabel said. Zabel also raised the possibility that Bitcoin could promote tax evasion as people use it to conceal dollars. \u201cThe currency itself could become a form of tax haven, both for businesses and individuals,\u201d he said. Both Vance and Zabel dismissed objections raised by investors at the previous day of the hearing that recent prosecutions of alleged money-laundering efforts involving digital currency demonstrate law enforcement can handle the industry\u2019s emergence. \u201cIt proves the opposite: this is a problem,\u201d Vance said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-29/prosecutor-warns-of-wild-west-without-bitcoin-oversight', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 30, 5, 1, 0, 7000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Needs Tighter Rules Than Banks, Say Prosecutors'}, {'articleText': u'  Charlie Shrem, a prominent Bitcoin evangelist, was indicted for allegedly trying to launder more than $1 million in the virtual currency in a case tied to the illicit online bazaar Silk Road.

Cohen, the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. \u2018\u2018The same is true for those seeking to evade sanctions,\u2019\u2019 Cohen said in a speech at the New York headquarters of Bloomberg News. Governments around the world are grappling with how to classify or regulate virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Authorities in Russia, China and Israel have sought to restrict the payment system, while Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in January the U.S. needed more time to assess the \u2018\u2018phenomenon\u2019\u2019 to ensure it isn\u2019t used for unlawful purposes. Cohen rejected arguments that regulation would drive virtual currency innovation out of the U.S., saying \u2018\u2018the opposite is true\u2019\u2019 in this new industry. \u2018\u2018Financial transparency can help bring stability to the virtual currency market and security to its users and investors,\u2019\u2019 Cohen said. \u2018\u2018And that is what we are trying to do through sensible, flexible and -\u2013 to use a word from the tech world -\u2013 scalable regulation.\u2019\u2019 At the same time, Cohen emphasized that the government would err on the side of squeezing innovation if necessary for law enforcement purposes. \u2018\u2018There may be situations where we need to choose between innovation and transparency,\u2019\u2019 Cohen said. \u2018\u2018Let me be clear: When forced to choose between the two, we will err on the side of transparency.\u2019\u2019 Cohen said that some virtual currency companies haven\u2019t registered with Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a requirement established in March 2013, and aren\u2019t following record keeping and reporting requirements. \u2018\u2018Those that do not comply with these rules should understand that their actions will have consequences,\u201d Cohen said. The Treasury Department\u2019s Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group will include a member of the virtual-currency community to help make regulations \u201cbetter informed and more effective,\u201d Cohen said, without saying who it will be. The department has urged industry leaders to devise ways to prevent criminal use of virtual currencies rather than develop technology that \u201cfurther obscures financial trails,\u201d he said. Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, emerged from a 2008 paper written by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It uses a public ledger to record transactions made under pseudonyms, an aspect of the system that has fed mistrust among law enforcement. The price for Bitcoins soared in November, topping $1,000 for the first time, as merchants including Overstock.com began accepting the virtual currency and speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. Prices dropped this year amid mounting U.S. prosecutions of Bitcoin-linked money laundering, concerns that governments would restrict the currency and market disruptions including hacker attacks on online exchanges. Bitcoin prices declined about 1 percent today, and stood at $612.50 at 11:08 a.m. New York time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. The decline was \u201clikely\u201d connected to the outage at the website Blockchain.info, a popular Bitcoin wallet provider, said Jonathan Levin, a co-founder of Coinometrics, a research firm in Oxford, U.K. He also said that digital currency markets are \u201cgrossly inefficient.\u201d Cohen said that the Treasury Department places \u201creal value\u201d on financial innovation such as digital currencies. \u201cAdvancements in technology that allow entrepreneurs and businesses to innovate, grow and hire are crucial to our country\u2019s long-term success,\u201d Cohen said. Cohen has served as undersecretary since 2011. He first joined the Treasury in 1999 and, while working for its general counsel, helped draft part of the Patriot Act that granted the regulator new tools to thwart money laundering and terrorist financing after the Sept. 11 attacks. The Treasury\u2019s office for terrorism and financial intelligence seeks to prevent criminal networks from using the U.S. financial system and to cut off funding for terrorists. It includes the Office of Foreign Assets Control that helps enforce sanctions on nations, such as Iran, that have a history of providing support to terrorist groups. New York financial regulators also have been working on a response to Bitcoin.

Firms trading at the unit of CBOE Holdings Inc. will be required to write down how they supervise their businesses, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from the Chicago-based options exchange. They must also carry out regular office inspections and send CBOE an annual report on regulatory practices. CBOE was fined $6 million in June by the SEC after regulators said the exchange\u2019s staff interfered with their investigation of illegal short selling at a member firm.

Thefts from digital wallets have exceeded $1 million in some cases and traders aren\u2019t protected against losses if their virtual exchange collapses, the European Banking Authority said today in a report warning consumers about the risks of cybermoney. Virtual currencies such as Bitcoin have come under increased scrutiny from regulators and prosecutors around the globe.

The digital money emerged in 2008, designed by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity remains unknown. Bitcoins are being used to pay for everything from Gummi bears to digital cameras on the Web, with more than 12 million in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks the online money\u2019s activity. The virtual currency gained credibility last month after law enforcement and securities agencies said in U.S. Senate hearings that it could be a legitimate means of exchange. The price of Bitcoins topped $1,000 as speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. The price has since dropped to about $866 on Bitstamp, an online exchange based in Slovenia. It would cost around $10.5 billion to buy all the Bitcoins in existence, according to Bitstamp. \u201cShould the popularity of a particular virtual currency go down, for example if another virtual currency becomes more popular, then it is quite possible for their value to drop sharply and permanently,\u201d the EBA said in a statement published on its website.

Attendees included model Kate Upton, actor Joe Pesci and Brad Grey, chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, which will release the film on Christmas Day. Paramount is owned by Viacom Inc. As research for their parts, Jonah Hill and DiCaprio visited Bank of America Corp.\u2019s trading floor, where Hill said he learned \u201cquite a lot.\u201d \u201cI got a lot of things from some people who were trying to sugar-coat it,\u201d McConaughey, who played a broker, said of his own research. \u201cYou could see what they were kind of fibbing about. I made up a rap out of all that.\u201d Cast member Jake Hoffman was one of the few who didn\u2019t bone up on Wall Street. \u201cI played Steve Madden, so while everyone else was talking about stocks, I was talking about women\u2019s shoes,\u201d Hoffman said. Rob Reiner also played a role in the movie that he said was not about the \u201ceveryday trading of Wall Street.\u201d \u201cI was the voice of reason -- I\u2019m supposed to rein in the excess Jordan Belfort exhibits, to no avail. It\u2019s like a parent watching their child run into the street with oncoming traffic and you feel helpless to stop him before he gets hit by a car.\u201d Terence Winter, the writer of the film, worked on the Merrill Lynch & Co. trading floor the day of the 1987 market crash. He long ago moved past playing the stock market. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the stomach for it,\u201d Winter said. \u201cI have two little kids, and I\u2019d really rather sleep at night and know that I have money in a certain place and it will probably be there tomorrow.\u201d Among the cast members interviewed, the one who seemed to be savviest about the securities world was P.J. Byrne, who plays one of Belfort\u2019s childhood buddies. He was a finance and theater major in college, and worked on Wall Street before returning to graduate school. \u201cI invest 14 or 15 percent of my salary in the stock market,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I just got Twitter at $33.\u201d (The stock closed yesterday above $56.) He doesn\u2019t own any Bitcoins. \u201cNo, God, I wish I had it. One day.\u201d Byrne said the actions depicted in the film are no model for behavior on Wall Street. \u201cThose are people that left ethics and morals at the door,\u201d he said. \u201cBring your ethics and morals with you when you show up to work every day.\u201d \u201cI would never tell anyone to stay away from the market,\u201d said Joey McFarland, a producer on the film, who still prefers to put his money in property and \u201cprivate endeavors.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all familiar with getting rich on Wall Street, but what the people are like is what we\u2019ve tried to capture,\u201d he said. \u201cThe debauchery, the outlandish, irresponsible, non-disciplined behavior that came along with it.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-18/scene-last-night-dicaprio-jonah-hill-belfort-at-wolf-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 18, 16, 43, 59, 230000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Scene Last Night: DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Belfort at \u2019Wolf\u2019'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-10-16/andreessen-if-bitcoin-works-it-could-be-profound', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-12-04/us-to-auction-50k-bitcoin-seized-from-silk-road', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-12-04/on-the-auction-block-50000-bitcoins', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-07-08/greece-s-cash-crisis-is-bitcoin-s-boost', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-08-03/mt-gox-founder-arrested-in-japan', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-08-19/bitcoin-identity-crisis-bloomberg-west-full-show-8-19-', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-09-07/bitcoin-island-cryptocurrency-on-the-isle-of-man', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-09-07/bitcoin-island-the-interviews', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u'  In the five years since bitcoin was created, the hunt for them has consumed enough electricity to keep the Eiffel Tower lit for 260 years. One man\u2019s way around the utility bills: the family power plant. Alex Wilhelm is a bitcoin miner, one of thousands who use computers to solve complex math problems and get their hands on the digital currency. The expatriate living in Tokyo has 30 remote-controlled servers mining virtual gold in an old brick building in the Austrian countryside. His father is donating the electricity, which comes from a water-driven turbine that survived a World War II bombing raid and once powered the entire village of Tattendorf, where Wilhelm grew up. While the operation is modest as mining farms go -- this year\u2019s yield may total no more than $12,500 -- it illustrates a basic point: the race to uncover cyber cash has become so energy intensive that power bills now make it mostly unprofitable. \u201cBasically you\u2019re turning electricity into money,\u201d Wilhelm said, sitting in jeans and a red sweatshirt in front of a flat-screen monitor in his Tokyo study. \u201cIf the electricity price goes up the math stops working.\u201d The 30-year-old software engineer turned to his computer and with a few keystrokes launched a tour of his mine halfway around the world. A video feed showed rows of circuit boards hanging like bats from metal racks inside a cavernous stone room where he used to play as a kid. At first, there was no sign of how hard the machines were working. Then he switched on the volume. Fans to cool the computers were so loud it was like being under a waterfall. \u201cYou can imagine if you have something like this at home, your wife won\u2019t be very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just loud and it\u2019s hot and it\u2019s expensive.\u201d That\u2019s the reason bitcoin miners are scouring the globe for the cheapest power prices. Consider Moses Lake, Washington, a quiet town in the Pacific Northwest with more cows than people. With the second-lowest electricity rates in the U.S., after Minot, North Dakota, it may become a bitcoin mecca. Robert Van Kirk is planning a move there. At 1.7 cents per kilowatt hour, rates are less than one-fifth the 10-cent national average. They\u2019re also below the 5 cents Van Kirk and partner Damir Kalinkin now pay in Portland for their business, MyRigSpace LLC, hosting mining gear in an old server farm. The partners aren\u2019t the only ones to zero-in on Moses Lake\u2019s rates. \u201cI called a real estate agent and I told them, we need a location with a lot of electricity,\u201d 24-year-old Van Kirk recounted in a phone conversation. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Oh are you guys involved in bitcoin?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Oh wow.\u2019\u201d Power consumption has always been bitcoin\u2019s bottleneck, says cryptographer Philipp G\xfchring. By one estimate, mining has gobbled up more than 150,000 megawatt hours of electricity since the cyber currency was invented. That\u2019s a year\u2019s worth of electricity for about 14,000 average U.S. homes, or more than two centuries for the Eiffel Tower. \u201cYes, you need the hardware and you need the software, but electricity is the core thing that drives bitcoin,\u201d G\xfchring, who co-wrote a 2011 paper on energy\u2019s role in virtual mining, said by phone from Vienna. \u201cIt\u2019s going to gravitate to wherever electricity is cheapest.\u201d Hence Tattendorf or Moses Lake, or Iceland, where a few wily entrepreneurs are tapping cheap geothermal power from volcanoes to drive one of the world\u2019s biggest mining farms. When bitcoin was created in 2009, by a programmer or group under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, it was intended to be finite, like a precious metal that has to be dug out of the ground. That helped the term \u201cmining\u201d take hold, but it\u2019s a misnomer. It\u2019s more like a cross between a math quiz and a lottery held six times every hour. People like Wilhelm race with their computers to solve puzzles and reap some of the 25 bitcoins spat out every 10 minutes by Nakamoto\u2019s algorithm. The more machines you have -- think of them as tickets - the better your chances are of winning. Bitcoin transactions run through a massive public ledger, open to anyone with the right software. Miners use their machines as accountants would, to tally and check all the bitcoins changing hands around the world. The first to do the math gets the reward. Never has bookkeeping been so alluring. Bitcoin prices shot up to more than $1,100 last year from about $13. The currency took hits in the last few months though, after China banned banks from dealing in it and the U.S. government decided to tax it. Another blow came when about $500 million in bitcoins disappeared from one of the biggest exchanges, Tokyo-based Mt.Gox, which then went bankrupt. The coins trade at $522 today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, an average from major global exchanges. Even some of bitcoin\u2019s fans say it\u2019s turned into a wasteful arms race. In a blog post widely circulated on Twitter last month, technologist Fred Trotter said mining has become a \u201cblack hole of resources.\u201d \u201cThe network would operate just fine with only 1 percent of the current computing muscle devoted to it,\u201d Trotter, a software developer and health-care consultant, said by phone from Denver. \u201cIt\u2019s consuming resources that should be allocated differently.\u201d Back in Tokyo, Wilhelm pulled up Coinwarz.com, a bitcoin calculator, to show why he\u2019d never use local power. Electricity here, in one of the world\u2019s most expensive markets, sells for 15 times the rate in Moses Lake. If he were running his 10 kilowatt operation in Tokyo, he figures he\u2019d lose about $13 a day after the $67 power bill. Wilhelm ended his virtual tour by calling his father on Skype. After a few glitches, a bear of a man appeared on screen and flashed the thumbs-up sign. For him, bitcoin\u2019s value is mostly sentimental. The 60-year-old retiree is worried the expiration of subsidies in 2016 will force them to shut the plant, an heirloom that\u2019s been in the family for six or seven generations. If the bitcoin experiment works, and they expand, it could be a way out. \u201cIt all depends on the value of bitcoin,\u201d the younger Wilhelm said. \u201cIf you\u2019re mining at this stage, you\u2019re not doing it to make dollars, you\u2019re doing it because you believe it will go up.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-16/bitcoin-miner-taps-dad-s-power-plant-in-virtual-money-hunt-tech', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 4, 16, 3, 38, 38, 588000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Miner Taps Dad\u2019s Power Plant in Virtual Money Hunt: Tech'}, {'articleText': u'  Blue Jay Way, a street that inspired a Beatles song, snakes above Los Angeles, lined with glassy mansions that jut like diving boards from earthquake-prone cliffs. One of the houses, a mid-century bungalow with an oval pool and a panoramic vista of the Los Angeles basin, rents for $27,000 a month. The owner, who lives in London, paid $2.25 million, or $835 a square foot, two years ago for the three-bedroom, three-bath home. \u201cThis is a very safe investment,\u201d Tyrone McKillen, an agent with Beverly Hills, California-based brokerage Hilton & Hyland Real Estate Inc., said as he walked through 1505 Blue Jay Way. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the view.\u201d While the cliffside properties seem perfectly perched for a Hollywood disaster movie, they\u2019re the equivalent of \u201csafety deposit boxes\u201d for wealthy global investors, according to Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. Like luxury London homes or Manhattan trophy apartments, California mansions are being bought by Chinese families, foreign tycoons and U.S. celebrities as a hedge against currency and stock market disasters or the vicissitudes of politics. Many investors pay in cash and don\u2019t live in the homes themselves. \u201cThe money is flowing here,\u201d Jeff Hyland, president of Hilton & Hyland, an affiliate of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate that completed sales on $1.9 billion in homes last year, said in a telephone interview. \u201cLondon\u2019s a place to park your money and grow your business. L.A. they look at as a year-round playground because of the weather and the beach and Hollywood.\u201d As many buyers struggle to get a mortgage or save for a down payment, investors are pushing real estate prices to new heights in some of the world\u2019s most costly markets. While trophy homes often sell for cash, lenders are also more willing to advance money for high-cost homes. The value of jumbo loans, those exceeding more than $625,500 in high cost areas, jumped 34 percent in the first nine months of last year to $216 billion, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins famous for suing Facebook Inc. co-founder Mark Zuckerberg over the social network\u2019s origins, got a $9 million loan from Deutsche Bank AG to buy an $18 million house near Blue Jay Way. A record number of California homes sold for $2 million or more last year, up 33 percent from 2012 to at least 7,383 deals, DataQuick reported last month. While new wealth from initial public offerings such as Facebook and Twitter Inc. propelled multimillion dollar sales in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, absentee investors accounted for much of the increase around Los Angeles, according to DataQuick. \u201cThe multimillion-dollar buyers have different drivers and concerns than buyers in the lower-price categories,\u201d said Andrew LePage, a senior analyst for San Diego-based DataQuick. \u201cWhen you get to $2 million or above, it has more to do with IPOs and where the wealthy want to park their excess cash.\u201d Absentee owners bought 27 percent of California\u2019s $1 million-plus homes last year, according to DataQuick. They represented 39 percent in Beverly Hills, 42 percent in Los Angeles\u2019s Bel Air neighborhood and 45 percent in the hills of West Hollywood. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said those types of investors are buying in \u201ca completely different stratosphere\u201d than the area\u2019s middle-class residents who face a dearth of affordable housing. So he welcomes their contribution to the city\u2019s economy and reputation. \u201cFor too long, L.A. has not been in the global conversation,\u201d Garcetti said in a Feb. 7 interview at Bloomberg LP\u2019s Los Angeles office. \u201cI want those people to come here. I want those people to talk about L.A. when they go back.\u201d Los Angeles luxury housing has typically been less expensive than in other major cities, according to London-based Knight Frank LLP. High-end homes sold in 2012 for $5,920 a square foot in Monaco, $5,050 in Hong Kong, $4,300 in London and $2,240 in New York, compared with $1,340 in Los Angeles, the property-consulting firm said in a March report. In Manhattan, the median sale price of condominiums reached a record $1.32 million in the fourth quarter, according to a report by New York-based Miller Samuel and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Luxury properties, the top 10 percent, sold for a median of $4.9 million, up 10 percent from a year earlier. According to data from StreetEasy.com, a real estate website owned by Zillow Inc., there were 145 Manhattan residences listed for more than $20 million last year, the most in records dating to 2005. Values in prime central London, including the affluent Mayfair and Knightsbridge neighborhoods, rose for a 39th consecutive month in January, gaining 7.8 percent from a year earlier and 135 percent over the past decade, according to Knight Frank. Foreigners bought 49 percent of all central London homes that sold for more than 1 million pounds ($1.66 million) in the 12 months through June, Knight Frank reported. In the West Hollywood enclave known as the Bird Streets, where Blue Jay Way is located, buyers have included the Winklevoss twins, producer Megan Ellison and Leonardo DiCaprio, a best-actor Oscar nominee for his role in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d who has owned a house on Oriole Way since 1999. The Winklevosses, who competed on the 2008 U.S. Olympic rowing team and whose current ventures include an exchange-traded fund investing in the virtual currency Bitcoin, bought a remodeled home on Tanager Way with an infinity pool, screening room and gym in August 2012. The property is listed under Heraclean Holdings LLC. In July, they refinanced their $9 million adjustable-rate loan on the house through the private wealth unit of Deutsche Bank, according to public records. The loan starts with a 3 percent interest rate that adjusts based on the London Interbank Offered Rate. The twins and their attorney, David Lehn, didn\u2019t reply to e-mails and voice messages left at their offices. Deutsche Bank doesn\u2019t comment on individual transactions and maintains strict confidentiality on its clients. In general, investors can use mortgages to their advantage in today\u2019s low-interest rate environment. \u201cThe residential mortgage is one of many tools financially sophisticated clients use in their overall investment strategy,\u201d said Peter Ferrara, managing director of real estate products at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management. \u201cA client may finance a home purchase immediately due to attractive interest rates. They also may look to that home as a source of financing for other investments later on.\u201d Ellison, co-producer of \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d and daughter of Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, sold three adjacent homes on Nightingale Drive last year for a combined $46.8 million, according to property records. In December, she paid $30 million for a hilltop estate on 8 acres east of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, with a view that sweeps from downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean. The deal was seen by real estate agents as opening new territory for high-end investors. \u201cThe house in question is probably a teardown,\u201d said Aaron Kirman, an agent with the John Aaroe Group who co-represented the property\u2019s seller along with Hilton & Hyland. \u201cThe views are outrageous.\u201d An e-mail and phone message left for Bebe Lerner, a spokeswoman for Ellison\u2019s Annapurna Pictures, weren\u2019t returned. Prices in high-end Los Angeles County communities, such as Beverly Hills, Malibu and Hollywood Hills, rose 7 percent last year to an average $825 a square foot for single-family homes, according to a report by the Agency, a Beverly Hills-based brokerage. The average is just 3.6 percent below its 2008 peak. For the broader Los Angeles market, prices are still 22 percent below their September 2006 apex, even after climbing 35 percent from the post-bubble low in 2009, the S&P/Case-Shiller index shows. Cash-bearing foreign investors account for the majority of high-end buyers in Los Angeles\u2019 most expensive areas, said Kirman, who showed homes this year to visitors from countries such as China, Indonesia and Tunisia. \u201cMany of these buyers give you a six-hour window before they fly off home,\u201d Kirman said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t buy here, they\u2019ll buy in London, New York or the South of France.\u201d Christian Candy, the British developer who helped create London\u2019s One Hyde Park luxury condo with his brother Nick, paid $24 million in August for a rebuilt mansion in Los Angeles\u2019s Holmby Hills neighborhood. The home is \u201can investment,\u201d Jessica Patrick, a spokeswoman for Candy & Candy Ltd., said in an e-mail from London. The builder of that house, Kristoffer Winters, closed this month on the purchase of a hillside lot \u201ca golf drive shot\u201d from Ellison\u2019s new estate, where he plans to build a 12,500-square-foot home to sell for at least $25 million, probably to an overseas investor. \u201cMost of the buyers now are foreigners,\u201d Winters said in a telephone interview. \u201cI\u2019m designing it as if someone is coming over with staff or with guests.\u201d International buyers are extending their influence into middle-class neighborhoods on the outskirts of Los Angeles. East Asians bought 53 percent of new homes sold last year in Irvine, a city 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles with a reputation for low crime and high-achieving schools, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc. At least one builder worries about becoming too dependent on money from China, which may stop flowing if there\u2019s a government crackdown or as a result of the economic downturn there. It may be a risk for builders to become too dependent on buyers coming from China, Bert Selva, chief executive officer of Shea Homes, a closely held builder based in Walnut, California, said at an industry conference in January. \u201cYou start to feel one group that\u2019s inelastic, and that concerns me,\u201d he said. Los Angeles was the No. 2 city after New York searched by Chinese real estate shoppers on the website Juwai.com, with a growing number seeking knock-down and rebuild opportunities, according to Dave Platter, a spokesman for the Hong Kong-based company. \u201cChinese buyers take up this trend because in Los Angeles, at the moment, stock is limited and prices are low,\u201d Platter said in an e-mail. \u201cThey find it easier to knock down an existing house than to find one that meets their needs.\u201d Not all of the highest-priced homes find buyers. The Beverly House, a 3.7-acre Beverly Hills compound originally built for William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies, failed to sell after a year with an asking price of $115 million. The owner, Beverly Hills attorney Leonard M. Ross, pulled it off the market this month because he expects better offers in the future. It\u2019s still available for rent at $600,000 a month. \u201cConsidering the current world economic and political situation, I expect values to rise,\u201d Ross said in an e-mail. \u201cI do not believe that this is the time for the fabled, incomparable estate to be sold.\u201d Local investors are scouring the priciest areas of Los Angeles for lots with aging homes that can be replaced by higher-value rebuilds. Bob Etebar, a Beverly Hills developer and principal of family-owned Etco Homes Inc., intends to build a 10,500-square-foot residence on a Blue Jay Way lot he bought in October for $3.7 million. Etebar and his brother Afshin expect to sell the new residence for more than $20 million. Another property on Blue Jay Way sold for $5.25 million on Dec. 31 to an investor who plans a rebuild on the lot, according to Robin Plunket, an agent with Keller Williams Realty Inc. who represented the seller, hair stylist Christophe Schatteman. \u201cIt\u2019s a $5.25 million teardown,\u201d said Plunket, a London native who has lived in Los Angeles for 30 years. \u201cL.A. is still the lowest cost of any major city. Compared with London, L.A.\u2019s cheap.\u201d Los Angeles also has a benevolent climate and a glamorous reputation. Marilyn Monroe posed in a Blue Jay Way home in 1962, one of her last photo shoots before her death. George Harrison, the late Beatle, wrote a 1967 psychedelic song called \u201cBlue Jay Way\u201d about waiting for friends lost in \u201ca fog upon L.A.\u201d It was clear and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius) last week when McMillen stood poolside at 1505 Blue Jay Way, the sun-splashed city spread at his feet, a scene that transforms to a carpet of starry lights at night. A renovated house across the street sold in November for $15.6 million, or $2,219 a square foot. A neighboring property is on the market for $16 million, or $50,000 a month to lease. \u201cIt\u2019s a very in-demand street,\u201d McKillen said. \u201cThe celebrity status has an effect. But the only reason they\u2019re here is because of the views.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-14/chinese-join-winklevosses-in-l-a-luxury-home-hedges', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 14, 16, 49, 59, 976000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Chinese Join Winklevosses in L.A.

Hundreds of Swiss banks could be covered by a U.S.- Switzerland accord over how to punish financial institutions that used secret accounts to help American clients hide assets from U.S. tax authorities. The U.S. said Aug. 29 it will continue criminal probes of 14 banks while allowing others to avoid prosecution by paying penalties and disclosing accounts. The accord lets Switzerland, the world\u2019s largest offshore financial center with about $2.2 trillion of assets, resolve talks spanning two years after U.S. criminal prosecutions eroded Swiss bank secrecy. Those under investigation include Credit Suisse Group AG, the second-largest Swiss bank; HSBC Holdings Plc, the largest European bank; and Julius Baer Group Ltd. Since 2009, the U.S. has prosecuted 68 account holders and more than 30 banking professionals for offshore tax crimes. Under the accord, banks that seek to avoid prosecution must pay penalties, disclose their cross-border activities, give detailed account information for U.S. clients, describe other banks that received secret accounts, and cooperate in requests for information under a U.S.-Swiss tax treaty. Banks wanting to participate in the program will need to apply for individual authorization, the Swiss government said in a statement Aug. 30. Banks that believe they have violated U.S. tax law must request non-prosecution agreements by Dec. 31. For more, click here. India Doubles Gold Futures Margins as Prices Rally to Record India\u2019s commodity markets regulator ordered exchanges to double margins on gold futures after a record plunge in the nation\u2019s currency fueled a rally in bullion priced in rupees to an all-time high. Initial margins on all contracts will rise to 5 percent of the value from Sept. 2, from 4 percent, the Forward Markets Commission said on its website. An additional margin of 5 percent will be levied on gold, silver, Brent crude, crude oil, and natural gas contracts due to high volatility in prices and it will be effective until further orders, it said. Futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. in Mumbai advanced to a record last week, rebounding 32 percent from a two-year low in June, threatening jewelry demand during the main festival season. Consumption in the country, which imports almost all the bullion it needs, accounted for about 20 percent of global demand in 2012, according to data from the World Gold Council. Futures have gained 6.3 percent this year, compared with a 17 percent drop in the metal priced in dollars.

Separately, the commission will introduce new rules on high-frequency trading, the Securities Times reported, citing an unidentified spokesman from the commission. Separately, China will regulate its state-owned companies and control its shareholders\u2019 actions, according to a statement posted to the commission\u2019s website. The nation\u2019s state-owned companies should coordinate business development with listed companies they control to eliminate internal competition, the commission said in the statement. India Said to Plan Tax Cut on Some Ore Exports to Help Rupee India is considering reducing taxes on some exports of iron ore to boost shipments and help reverse a decline in the local currency, said two government officials with direct knowledge of the matter. Taxes on overseas shipments of low-grade fines, or small particles, may be cut to 20 percent from 30 percent, the people said, declining to be identified before a public announcement. The lower tax will apply only to a part of the exported quantity, they said without elaborating. The proposal is with the finance ministry and will be placed before the cabinet for approval soon, they said. Boosting exports will help Prime Minister Manmohan Singh narrow the current account deficit, avert a balance of payments crisis and stem the plunge in the rupee, which has declined 16 percent this year, the worst performance after the South African Rand among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Lower taxes will also help Indian miners regain market share in China from Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billion Ltd. D.S. Malik, a spokesman at the finance ministry, declined to comment, while Ruby Sharma, spokeswoman for the mines ministry, didn\u2019t answer two calls to her office numbers after business hours. Aberdeen Asset Management Fined $11.2 Million by U.K. Watchdog The U.K. markets regulator fined Aberdeen Asset Management Plc 7.2 million pounds ($11.2 million) for failing to properly handle client money from 2008 through 2011. The firm didn\u2019t have the correct documentation for around 685 million pounds in client funds placed in money market deposits, the London-based Financial Conduct Authority said in a statement on its website today. The regulator stepped up enforcement of client-money rules after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. The New York-based bank\u2019s former U.K. unit failed to segregate billions of dollars of client funds from its own accounts, leaving creditors with competing claims that resulted in years of litigation. The issue resurfaced in the administration of MF Global\u2019s U.K. unit. Aberdeen Asset Management, Scotland\u2019s largest money manager, received the FCA\u2019s standard 30 percent discount on the fine for cooperating with the probe. \u201cWe regret that the situation arose, have cooperated fully with the FCA in the course of its investigation and have amended our U.K. procedures regarding bank deposits following the FCA\u2019s guidance,\u201d Aberdeen Asset Management said in an e-mailed statement. Everbright Securities Plunges After Record Penalty, Resignations Everbright Securities Co. plunged to the lowest since its shares started trading in 2009 after errant trades drew a record penalty from China\u2019s securities regulator and two executives resigned. The country\u2019s seventh-largest brokerage by market value fell by the 10 percent daily limit to 9.06 yuan at the opening yesterday in Shanghai, after its shares were suspended on Aug. 30. The China Securities Regulatory Commission said Aug. 30 the broker engaged in insider trading Aug. 16 when it roiled the nation\u2019s equity markets with erroneous stock-purchase orders worth as much as 23.4 billion yuan ($3.8 billion). Fines and the confiscation of illicit gains will total 523 million yuan, the CSRC said. Assistant President Yang Chizhong and Board Secretary Mei Jian tendered their resignations, Everbright said Sept. 1 in statements to the Shanghai stock exchange. Four people including ex-President Xu Haoming will be banned from markets for life and the brokerage was barred from most proprietary trading, the CSRC said. Xu resigned and the brokerage suspended Yang Jianbo, the head of its proprietary trading business. The firm estimated it lost 194 million yuan on the trades, based on Aug. 16 closing prices, and said the figure may change. The brokerage\u2019s proprietary trading business, excluding fixed income, has been halted and the CSRC will also suspend reviews of any new businesses for Everbright, the regulator said. Everbright was sued by investors in Guangzhou and Shanghai seeking damages for losses. Courts in the two cities have received the claims and haven\u2019t yet decided whether to accept them, Ye Xiaolei and Yan Yiming, lawyers for the investors, said today. The CSRC didn\u2019t reply to a faxed query seeking comments and three phone calls to Everbright\u2019s offices in Shanghai went unanswered today. The company hasn\u2019t commented on the CSRC ruling. The Guangzhou investor is seeking 70,000 yuan in compensation from Everbright and the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Ye said by telephone from Shenzhen today. The Shanghai investor is seeking about 99,000 yuan, Yan said by phone from Shanghai. Beijing-based lawyer Zhang Yuanzhong said his firm had been contacted by investors who claim damages of more than 1 million yuan for their losses due to the market turmoil. Everbright\u2019s orders helped push the benchmark Shanghai Composite index from a loss of as much as 1 percent to a gain of 5.6 percent in two minutes. Chinese securities law allows investors to file civil suits for losses arising from insider trading, the CSRC said in the statement that detailed the penalties on Everbright. The brokerage has the right to request a hearing with the CSRC before the penalties become final, the regulator said. Spanish Police Catch \u2018Sewer Gang\u2019 That Robbed Banks in Madrid Spanish police said they captured a gang of robbers that specialized in using Madrid\u2019s sewers for planning raids on bank branches. Officers arrested 10 people involved in seven violent bank raids in the capital, police said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Four of the gang were caught as they emerged from underground after a raid in which they stole 60,000 euros ($79,300), the police said. They were armed with three guns, a club, flashlights and tape to immobilize their victims, according to the statement. El Mundo newspaper reported in June that police had been for the past seven years chasing a gang that used its knowledge of Madrid\u2019s 1,240-mile sewer system to plan bank raids. Dutch Regulator Keeps Insurer Rate Curve After France Cut Aegon NV and Delta Lloyd NV are among Dutch insurers facing a drop in solvency because regulators decided to preserve the interest-rate curve used to calculate liabilities following France\u2019s downgrade. \u201cDiscussions took place at the request of the Dutch Association of Insurers to explore the possibility to allow for a different alternative interest-rate curve,\u201d the Dutch Central Bank, or DNB, said Aug. 29 in a statement. \u201cHowever, DNB currently sees insufficient reason to approve a different alternative interest-rate curve.\u201d Insurers asked the regulator to reconsider after Fitch Ratings stripped France, Europe\u2019s second-largest economy, of its AAA rating in July.  The Dutch Association of Insurers, a trade group representing about 95 percent of the market, said the industry still has a strong solvency position. The Netherlands, together with Germany, Finland and Luxembourg, are the only remaining countries in the euro region that have top ratings at the three major rating companies. Bitcoin Exchange Tradehill Pauses for Regulatory Reasons Tradehill Inc., an exchange for virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, is temporarily suspending trading, citing unspecified banking and regulatory reasons. \u201cThis decision has not been made lightly and we regret having to take such action,\u201d the company said Aug. 30 on its website. The company said it plans to \u201cto upgrade, improve, and polish our trading platform.\u201d Tradehill has been seeking more business from investors and financial institutions as it works to legitimize virtual-currency trading in the U.S. The San Francisco-based company is among several upstart exchanges such as Mt. Gox and BTC-e that have emerged to support Bitcoin trading. Jered Kenna, chief executive officer of Tradehill, didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment. Tradehill registered last month with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a U.S. Treasury agency that targets money laundering, the company said in its statement. Steve Hudak, an agency spokesman, said he couldn\u2019t comment on any regulatory issues for a specific firm. FinCEN, as the Treasury agency is known, released guidance in March saying digital-currency administrators and exchangers are considered money-services businesses subject to regulations and anti-money-laundering controls. Regulators in Tradehill\u2019s home state, California, have also been watching virtual currencies. Mark Leyes, a spokesman for California Department of Business Oversight, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on Tradehill. Payment Group Says U.S. Banks Can Work With Legal Online Lenders Banks can do business with Internet-based lenders that don\u2019t violate the law, the nation\u2019s primary payment system said in a letter that followed warnings from regulators about the online firms\u2019 practices. Nacha, the group that oversees the automated clearing house network, told the Online Lenders Alliance, an industry association, that banks have to examine the circumstances of lenders\u2019 work and \u201ctake action where appropriate.\u201d Banks need not stop processing payments \u201cfor online lenders engaged in legal lending activity,\u201d Jane Larimer, the executive vice president and general counsel of Nacha said in an Aug. 26 letter. Nacha\u2019s members include Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., PNC Financial Services Group and U.S. Bancorp. Benjamin Lawsky, New York\u2019s state superintendent of financial services, on Aug. 6 ordered a group of 35 online lenders, including at least four owned by Native American tribes, to cease offering loans in New York. He charged the loans violated New York\u2019s interest rate caps. Lawsky also sent a letter to 117 banks and Nacha itself requesting their assistance to \u201cchoke off\u201d the lenders from the automated clearing house system, the bank-supported network that handles electronic bank account debits. Nacha responded on Aug. 8 by asking banks to advise the payment network whether they are still doing business with the online lenders named by Lawsky. The online lending group has argued, on various grounds, that its members do not violate the law. The Department of Justice and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have also been pressuring banks to reconsider their relationships with online lenders. Norway\u2019s FSA Says Banks Had Core Capital of 11% End of June Norway\u2019s Financial Supervisory Authority said banks are meeting minimum capital requirements put in place from July 1 this year, according to an e-mailed statement Aug. 30. The nation\u2019s banks had core capital of 11 percent at the end of June, the Authority said in the statement. The Authority also said banks had core capital of 9.9 percent a year earlier. Rhoen Assumes It\u2019s Not Focus of German Prosecutors Investigation Rhoen-Klinikum, the German health-care facility operator, has no information about reported investigations, spokesman Sascha Schiffler said in e-mail statement Aug. 30. Rhoen said the company would fully cooperate if public prosecutors contact it. The Data Protection Authority, or DPA, reported alleged market manipulation by Rhoen staff, citing Steinkraus-Koch of the Munich public prosecutors office. The case concerns alleged violation of security trading law and attempted coercion, according to the DPA. Banks Boosted Capital by $500 Billion Since 2009, Carney Says Large international banks raised about half a trillion dollars in fresh capital since 2009 and are moving closer to complying with global capital rules, said Mark Carney, chairman of the Financial Stability Board. Carney, who is the governor of the Bank of England, said that the capital raising has been \u201cencouraging\u201d though \u201cuneven,\u201d in a press conference in London yesterday. Global banks had core capital reserves averaging about 9 percent of their risk-weighted assets at the end of 2012, above the 7 percent required under the updated Basel standards, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said in a report last week. All jurisdictions needed to comply with tougher capital rules by 2019, Carney told journalists.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-03/swiss-penalty-india-margins-dutch-insurers-compliance', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 9, 3, 12, 56, 33, 909000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Swiss Penalty, India Margins, Dutch Insurers: Compliance'}, {'articleText': u'  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in an effort to ensure that multinational companies pay their taxes, says it will publish a proposal focused on the digital economy in the next two months. The group, supported by 34 member countries including the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan, aims to address issues raised by digital businesses in a world that taxes activities based on their physical locations. In July. the group proposed developing rules during the next two years to prevent companies from avoiding taxes. The idea was endorsed by the Group of 20 major economies. The rules would try to keep companies from taking interest deductions in one country without reporting taxable profits in another and would require disclosure to regulators of income from subsidiaries around the world. A group of technology companies said in a letter to the OECD that officials shouldn\u2019t propose separate rules for their industry. The group\u2019s proposals are also being fought by some of its own member countries. Commonwealth Bank of Australia Curtails Multibank Chat Rooms Commonwealth Bank of Australia followed global rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in restricting traders and dealers from using chat rooms as regulators probe alleged currency rigging. Employees in its markets teams will be prohibited from using instant-messaging groups with counterparts at more than one bank starting this month, Peter Habib, a Sydney-based spokesman, said. He said the bank is \u201cimplementing best practices,\u201d and declined to comment further. Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are curtailing use of chat rooms after regulators used them in investigations into the manipulation of benchmark interest rates and currencies. Firms have also fired or suspended staff since Bloomberg News reported in June that some employees said they shared data about positions to try and rig a key gauge in the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market. Special Section: Davos Forum Davos Makes Inequality Its Business as Political Backlash Seen Reducing inequality is this year\u2019s buzzword at the World Economic Forum at Davos. Business and financial leaders are making the case that a reversal of the multi-decade trend is needed as much for business and economic interests as for social and moral reasons. Failure to narrow the gap risks robbing economies of demand and threatens banks and big businesses with political and regulatory backlashes if voters rebel at squeezed wages. A poll of Bloomberg subscribers released this week found 58 percent view income disparity as a brake on economic growth, with 68 percent urging governments to confront the problem. Income gaps can undermine economic demand and brew populist pressures on governments to protect voters, said Tim Adams, president of the Institute of International Finance, which represents more than 400 financial firms. Lew Calls Bitcoin a Place to Hide, Shares Dimon\u2019s \u2018Incredulity\u2019 The U.S. government needs more time to assess the Bitcoin \u201cphenomenon\u201d to ensure the virtual currency isn\u2019t used for unlawful purposes, \u201clike terrorist activities,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said. Lew, who leads the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to fight illicit finance globally, said he discussed Bitcoin with JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and shares a \u201ccertain incredulity\u201d about it. Lew made the remarks in an interview with CNBC yesterday at Davos. Iran\u2019s Rouhani Invites Oil Investment as Sanctions Eased Hassan Rouhani, the first Iranian leader in a decade to visit Davos for the World Economic Forum, invited oil companies to invest in his country as a nuclear accord with world powers triggers the lifting of some sanctions. Rouhani told a meeting of about 30 executives, mostly from the oil industry, that Iran has a good investment environment now and that risk is low, said Lin Boqiang, director of China Center for Energy Economics Research, who attended the meeting yesterday. Iran, holder of the world\u2019s fourth-largest proven oil reserves, saw its economy shrink more than 5 percent in the fiscal year through March under the weight of international sanctions.

Controls on pawnbrokers and corporate service providers such as lawyers and accountants can also be improved, according to a government risk study released today. Singapore authorities are closely monitoring virtual currencies such as Bitcoins that may be used for illegal activities and will consider regulation if needed, according to the report. \u201cSingapore\u2019s openness as an international transport hub and financial center exposes it to inherent cross-border\u201d money laundering or terrorism financing risks, according to the study. MAS \u201chas put in place a robust preventive regime. Nonetheless, there are areas for further enhancement.\u201d The risk assessment study comes seven weeks after Singapore police and the bank association urged residents to be wary of fraudsters seeking to use their bank accounts to funnel illegal funds after an increase of reported cases last year. Remittance agents, who accept funds for transfer to individuals outside Singapore, and money changers operate in \u201ccash-intensive\u201d industries and offer greater risks of money laundering or terrorism financing, according to today\u2019s report. Total outward remittance from Singapore amounted to S$24.1 billion ($19 billion) in 2012, while inward remittances were S$995 million, the government said in the study. Volumes in the money-changing business that year were S$36.8 billion. The implementation of controls in these industries isn\u2019t as robust as in banks and MAS will ensure \u201cenforcement efforts are further stepped up,\u201d according to the report. The pawnbroking industry had total loans outstanding at over S$1 billion in 2012, the study showed. The number of pawn shops in the city increased to 191 that year from 114 in 2008. MAS is also considering additional supervisory powers and requirements to bolster \u201cnascent\u201d money laundering and terrorism financing controls for Internet payment companies such as PayPal Inc. or Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s Alipay. Agencies involved in the study included MAS, the customs bureau, the casino regulator, the finance, home affairs and law ministries, and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. Accountants and other corporate service providers can be exposed to money laundering and terrorist financing activities if higher-risk customers hire them to set up complex structures that conceal ownership and reduce the transparency of transactions, according to the study. Singapore\u2019s central bank is stepping up its anti-money laundering rules in line with global regulations following U.S. authorities\u2019 investigation of several Swiss banks for their dealings on behalf of American clients. MAS made it a crime last July for clients to use financial institutions to evade tax. UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland\u2019s largest banks, are among firms implicated in a U.S. crackdown since 2008 on offshore tax evasion that led to charges against about 70 American taxpayers and 30 bankers, lawyers and advisers. The U.S. charged UBS in 2009 with aiding tax evasion by thousands of American clients. The Zurich-based bank avoided prosecution by paying a $780 million penalty, admitting it fostered tax evasion and agreeing to hand over data on client accounts to U.S. tax officials. Risks for private banks operating in Singapore are lower than those for full banks because they have fewer clients, less physical cash transactions and more checks when customers open accounts, according to today\u2019s report. Singapore is Asia\u2019s largest private banking center with offshore assets of about $800 billion, Boston Consulting Group data show as of September. In Singapore, the number of reported cases of illegitimate cash being given to so-called money mules to hand over to a third party increased to 133 in the first nine months of last year, up from 93 for all of 2012, local police, the bank association and the National Crime Prevention Council said in November. The amount of illegal monies in those cases fell to S$15.5 million from 2012\u2019s S$24.6 million.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-10/singapore-may-step-up-rules-on-money-laundering-terror-finance', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 10, 9, 18, 7, 749000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Singapore May Step Up Money Laundering, Terror Finance Rules'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-11-04/why-bitcoin-is-on-a-massive-winning-streak', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' As the government shutdown persists, the GOP is alienating traditional supporters, including small business owners, Joshua Green reports.

He authored one bill to repeal a federal ban on carrying firearms in school zones and one declaring that human life exists from fertilization. Now, in his long-shot bid for the U.S. Senate, Stockman has turned his sights to campaign finance by offering to take donations in bitcoins. This comes as sweet harmony to those who think the controversial cyber currency represents a blow to the federal banking system they loathe, a cause never more at home than on Stockman\u2019s turf. It was in Texas that former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul launched his assault on the U.S. money system. Almost a dozen Texas lawmakers lined up last year to cosponsor the \u201cSound Dollar Act,\u201d a bill by Kevin Brady, a state representative, that would require the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep prices stable by monitoring a clutch of assets, including gold. (The private website GovTrack.us gives the bill a 1 percent chance of passing.) And while a handful of companies such as dating website OKCupid have announced plans to accept bitcoins, doubts about bitcoins\u2019 long-term stability run deep. The Federal Election Commission hasn\u2019t decided whether they\u2019re a proper funding tool or not. The commission in November deadlocked on the issue, with three Democrats on the six-member panel voting against a proposal to treat bitcoins as an \u201cin-kind\u201d contribution similar to stocks and bonds. The commissioners \u201calso discussed the possibility of developing an interim policy,\u201d according to a summary of the meeting. FEC spokeswoman Judith Ingram declined to comment. Stockman isn\u2019t dettered. \u201cI really think digital currency is more about freedom,\u201d he says of the virtual currency in a Dec. 31\xa0YouTube video. Speaking outside the newly minted Bitcoin Center near Wall Street, Stockman continues, \u201cAll the time people are trying to get into your pocket, trying to do different things to control you, and if you have your own wealth and control your own wealth, it\u2019s about freedom.\u201d The anonymous nature of bitcoin highlights anew the quandary of tracing who exactly is funding political campaigns. And Mark Williams, who teaches finance at Boston University, is skeptical for other reasons. \u201cIf bitcoin is adopted, it will create financial instability in the economy, decline in [gross domestic product], and drop in overall commerce,\u201d he says. Volatility is the number one concern, said Williams, who points to China\u2019s announcement last month that it would not accept bitcoins: \u201cWithin 48 hours,\u201d he notes, \u201cits value dropped by 50 percent.\u201d The virtual currency has since recovered, but the fact that Stockman would \u201cendorse a currency that can move by 20 or 30 percent in a given day\u201d shows him to be irresponsible, Williams says. He accuses the Senate candidate of showboating\u2014not the first time Stockman has faced the allegation. His campaign has issued a bumper sticker that reads: \u201cIf babies had guns they wouldn\u2019t be aborted,\u201d the Washington Post reported. Stockman\u2019s website promises to send \u201cone of my Obama barf bags\u201d for a $10 donation, and on a campaign\xa0Twitter feed the congressman has opined that \u201cthe best gun lubricant around\u201d is \u201cliberal tears.\u201d Stockman spokesman Donny Ferguson did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Stockman, who served in Congress in the 1990s and was elected again in 2012, surprised analysts who thought he\u2019d keep his House seat when he filed papers in December, just minutes before the deadline, to challenge Senate incumbent John Cornyn in the Republican primary. One poll has had Stockman down by 44 points. As for where his campaign might spend those bitcoins, most early adopters of the virtual currency, such as online gaming company Zynga, are of little obvious value to a political candidate. His best bet might be Overstock.com, the online seller of everything from furniture to electronics, which has said it will accept bitcoins by mid-year. To make that bit of campaign-finance history, though, Stockman will have to survive the March primary.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/TMoroney', 'name': u'Tom Moroney', 'twitterhandle': u'TMoroney'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-08/does-bitcoin-have-a-future-in-politics-a-texas-senate-candidate-thinks-so', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 8, 18, 6, 57, 650000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Does Bitcoin Have a Future in Politics?'}, {'articleText': u' Last November several people spoke at a Senate hearing to defend bitcoin. I already got a little cranky about them, but looking back over their testimony, there\u2019s another small thing that they all believe that is unsupported by real-world experience: Bitcoin will help people who don\u2019t currently use a bank. According to the World Bank, about 2.5 billion people worldwide don\u2019t have a bank account, which makes it hard for them to save money and build credit. Not to worry. \u201cThe combination of ubiquitous Internet-connected mobile devices and digital currency presents a tremendous opportunity to radically expand access to financial services on a worldwide basis,\u201d testified Jeremy Allaire, chief executive officer of Circle Internet Financial, which specializes in money transfer using digital currency. Jerry Brito of the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank, said bitcoin could improve mobile money services already operating in the developing world. Bitcoin can exist wherever there\u2019s a mobile phone, said Patrick Murck of the Bitcoin Foundation, and \u201c\u2026 we believe Bitcoin has tremendous potential to improve the capacity of people around the world to build and store wealth.\u201d Bitcoin does dramatically lower the transaction costs of moving money from one place to another, but that alone won\u2019t help. The mobile money services that have sprung up throughout the developing world have the same advantage. Recently, mobile-money researchers have begun scratching their heads over a phenomenon they never anticipated: Rather than opening an account on a mobile phone and using it for transactions, a surprisingly large number of people take their cash, ask someone with a digital account to transfer it to someone else with an account, who in turn switches the transfer back into cash for a fourth person\u2014the intended target. Researchers call these over-the-counter, or OTC, transactions. Half the mobile money transactions in Bangladesh are conducted OTC. Almost two thirds of the transactions for EasyPaisa, a mobile money service in Pakistan, run OTC. In Kenya, which serves as a worldwide model for the possibilities of mobile money, about two-thirds of all transactions are conducted this way. In theory, mobile money, like bitcoin, offers an ideal advantage over cash: It radically reduces the transaction cost of saving and transferring money. A bank customer no longer has to get to a bank or an ATM, in some cases a day\u2019s bus ride away. But transportation isn\u2019t the only barrier. As Greg Chen of the World Bank\u2019s Consultative Group to Assist the Poor describes it, many of the unbanked may be illiterate, exhausted by their daily work, and put off by new technologies. Under these circumstances, paying an agent to process mobile payments does not seem unreasonable. Bitcoin could further lower the cost of a mobile money service by making transaction confirmations cheaper. That\u2019s good. But it can\u2019t do anything about the transaction costs that Chen describes: illiteracy, exhaustion, and suspicion of new technology. Bitcoin can\u2019t teach people how to read. And that doesn\u2019t even explore the social barriers to using mobile money that researchers are already finding. It is incredibly tempting to believe that bad technology is all that stands in the way of helping everyone. Alienation from technology is not a problem in San Francisco or, to be fair, in most of the developed world. But it is for the 2.5 million unbanked. There are still huge barriers before they can even get to the point where bitcoin can help them.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/bhgreeley', 'name': u'Brendan Greeley', 'twitterhandle': u'bhgreeley'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-10/lessons-from-mobile-payments-bitcoin-will-not-help-the-poor-or-unbanked', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 10, 10, 47, 1, 796000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"'Digital Money Will Save the World's Poor' and Other Delusions"}, {'articleText': u" A new network of investors called BitAngels has pooled $6.7 million in Bitcoin, which it plans to dole out to Bitcoin startups, Rip Empson reports.

A hacker can tinker with the code that makes a Bitcoin transaction happen, so that it looks like it didn\u2019t go through. The person who was supposed to receive a payment then asks again and, in Mt. Gox\u2019s case, is paid again automatically. Mt. Gox has acknowledged this was happening. It seems that someone has been slowly bleeding it for months, leaving it without the funds to pay out legitimate withdrawals. But with the company being pretty tight-lipped about it for now, that\u2019s only the best theory. Was this a shot from the blue?\n      Not quite. Mt. Gox has been having problems for months, and people have been complaining about not being able to get their money out of the system since late last year. The company halted withdrawals altogether in early February. So while the number of lost Bitcoins is striking, many people have seen the failure of Mt. Gox as imminent for a while. Who is affected?\n      Many people who had Bitcoins were relying on Mt. Gox to hold them, and the chances they will get them back at this point don\u2019t seem very good. Other Bitcoin companies may also be affected. BTC.SX, which allows users to trade derivatives based on the Bitcoin market, said Tuesday it couldn\u2019t take new orders because of Mt. Gox\u2019s problems, although it also said that users\u2019 balances were secure and it would continue to honor withdrawals. Where did the lost Bitcoins go?\n      In theory, Mt. Gox could begin to track their path by identifying the fraudulent transactions and searching for the wallets the coins ended up in. But no one is putting much faith in the accounting expertise over there at the moment. In any case, many of the tainted coins have likely moved beyond their initial destinations. If there really has been a slow leak from Mt. Gox for a long time, then the coins could have spread to the ends of the earth by now. One thing is certain: They are probably all over the place, just based on the sheer number of coins alleged to have been stolen. They\u2019d amount to about 6 percent of the Bitcoins in existence. Is this a security problem with Bitcoin itself?\n      When Mt. Gox described the issue as a bug in the Bitcoin protocol, people didn\u2019t appreciate it. The technical issue at the root of Mt. Gox\u2019s problem didn\u2019t just crop up recently; it seems that Mt. Gox was left vulnerable because it didn\u2019t protect itself against the issue. What\u2019s next?\n      For Mt. Gox, probably not much. For the rest of the Bitcoin world, probably greater scrutiny from regulators, who will want to be confident that this doesn\u2019t happen again. And for those who lost their Bitcoin, likely a fair dose of cynicism.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-26/where-did-the-bitcoins-go-the-mt-dot-gox-shutdown-explained', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 26, 19, 5, 40, 574000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Where Did the Bitcoins Go?

With this month\u2019s tax-filing deadline, Bitcoin has reached a milestone in its long-shot quest to become real digital money. The ranks of taxpayers grappling with how to fit their cyberriches into their returns has grown large enough for the federal government to offer the first set of guidelines. And accountants are facing a small but noticeable uptick in questions from clients. Matthew Whatley, the founder of Tax Ninja, a firm serving the San Francisco startup set, says that he fielded his first Bitcoin-related tax question last year, when about five people said they had profited by speculating on the cybercurrency. This year he has already heard from 50 people. Given that few people really understand taxes and even fewer understand Bitcoins, it\u2019s tempting to believe that tax issues surrounding the cybercurrency would be mind-blowingly complex. In most cases, Whatley says,\xa0things remain fairly simple.\xa0The Internal Revenue Service tried to clear things up last week by saying it considered Bitcoin property, not money\u2014and anyone making money from Bitcoins should tell the government about it. If someone bought a single Bitcoin when it was worth $100 and sold it this week for $465, that would require a report of $365 in capital gains. The tax rates on such gains can be upwards of 40 percent, depending on how long someone held the Bitcoins and their overall income. Like stock gains, Bitcoin gains are taxed only when someone cashes them in. Whatley had already been advising his clients to consider Bitcoin investments as capital gains. But the IRS has officially eliminated a trick that could have been a potential windfall in a future where major purchases could be made with Bitcoins. \u201cThere was this giant awesome loophole that existed,\u201d says Whatley. \u201cIf you had a million dollars in Bitcoin that you originally spent a few thousand dollars for, you could buy a house and not pay capital gains taxes on it.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s believers are split on whether the IRS\u2019s attention is a good or bad development. On the one hand, it\u2019s another federal agency weighing in on Bitcoins in a not entirely hostile way. On the other hand, the IRS\u2019s proclamation that Bitcoin isn\u2019t currency could be self-fulfilling. Investors can keep track of capital gains with relative ease, but having to account for constant changes in value makes the idea of a day-to-day life full of Bitcoin transactions seem rather daunting. \u201cI have to question the effectiveness of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange when the user has to calculate his or her tax liability on every single transaction,\u201d wrote a Reddit user claiming to be a tax attorney who has been providing exhaustive answers to tax questions about Bitcoin. \u201cAs the saying goes, the power to tax is the power to destroy, and this is no exception.\u201d Things could get particularly complicated for Bitcoin miners, who create new coins by verifying the transactions of others. People running such operations would have to account for the value of each coin at the moment it came into existence while figuring out exactly how to deduct the electricity costs from running Bitcoin mining rigs, which are power hogs. Everything becomes trickier for other types of cybercurrencies that don\u2019t necessarily have exchanges with agreed-on prices. Another bitter pill to swallow for people drawn to Bitcoins for matters of discretion is uncertainty around when you have to tell the taxman about your Bitcoin fortune. While the IRS has ruled that Bitcoin can\u2019t be considered foreign currency, accountants offer differing opinions about whether Bitcoin accounts are foreign accounts that must be reported to the government or at what threshold such requirements kick in. Given the heavy penalties, anyone with more than $10,000 in Bitcoins should tell the federal government, says Dave Baldwin, an accountant who is part of a task force studying virtual currencies for the American Institute of CPAs.\xa0\u201dIf it was me, and I was holding Bitcoins, I\u2019d probably do so,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford the cost not to report.\u201d Then there\u2019s Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that shut down earlier this year after admitting it had lost almost all its users\u2019 Bitcoins\u2014along with reams of data about past transactions. \u201cI need to know when I purchased my BTC and at what price, but Mt. Gox took that information down with them when they imploded,\u201d wrote Andrew Badr, the organizer of San Francisco\u2019s Bitcoin Meetup. \u201cI unsuccessfully tried to find my records in their database that got leaked by hackers.\u201d Victims of the Mt. Gox disaster may also have a significant tax benefit: They can write off their losses, offsetting future gains on other investments, Bitcoin-related or otherwise. But if someone bought Bitcoins several years ago, the IRS would view the losses as minimal, because value would be measured by the cost of the acquisition, not the value of the Bitcoins at the time of its disappearance. Whatley thinks that someone could challenge this, but it will take a while. Mt. Gox collapsed earlier this year, meaning it would be tax day 2015 before someone could try to claim losses. There would likely be several years of back and forth before a ruling was handed down. By that time, many skeptics think the Bitcoin story will be long done. Count Whatley among them. \u201cI don\u2019t own any Bitcoin,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t plan on buying any.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-31/what-your-accountant-thinks-about-your-bitcoins', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 31, 16, 41, 36, 980000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'What Your Accountant Thinks About Your Bitcoins'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-12-02/why-china-s-millennials-are-happy-to-own-nothing', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 2, 22, 42, 2, 304000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Why China's Millennials Are Happy to Own Nothing"}, {'articleText': u' Sun Minjie, a 28-year-old Internet worker who lives in Beijing, has invested more than $3,000 in 796\xa0Xchange, a website where people buy and sell shares of companies that deal in Bitcoins, the digital currency.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained about 4.6\xa0percent during the same period. \u201cIn China, the stock market, property, and bond market are all not so good, so people get really excited when they hear of a new investment that generates high returns,\u201d says Peter Pak, head of trading at BOCI Securities in Hong Kong. In May, China briefly overtook the U.S. in monthly creation of Bitcoins, rising from seventh place in August last year. China now ranks second, according to SourceForge, a technology website that tracks Bitcoin activity worldwide. Created four years ago by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to buy and sell a growing range of goods and services online\u2014from cupcakes to electronics to illegal narcotics. Computer users can \u201cmine\u201d Bitcoins by solving mathematical puzzles\u2014uncovering the hidden series of letters and numbers that matches up with security keys specified by the computer programmers who invented the currency. As more coins are mined, the puzzles get harder, and cracking them requires specialized computers. Sun gave up after a month, concluding that his computers weren\u2019t up to the task. \u201cSimple desktops can no longer dig them up,\u201d he says. There are about 11.6\xa0million Bitcoins in circulation, reports currency tracker Blockchain.info, and the total number that can be mined is capped at about 21\xa0million. Prices have been volatile, varying from $84 to $266 each over one week in April, according to Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the largest exchange that allows Bitcoins to be traded for dollars, euros, and other currencies. At the recent price of about $144, the almost 10\xa0million Bitcoins yet to be mined have a value of $1.44\xa0billion. In China, that buried treasure is attracting sellers of virtual mining equipment such as Labcoin, managed by Hong Kong-based ITec-Pro. Labcoin, which began trading its shares this month on an online exchange, has a market value of 20,000\xa0Bitcoins, or about $2.9\xa0million. Another company, Myminer, operates \u201cmining farms\u201d in China, where it says the low cost of power to run vast numbers of computers gives it an edge. BTCChina.com, China\u2019s most popular Bitcoin exchange, lets traders use the payment systems of more established companies, including Tencent and Alipay, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, to buy and sell the virtual currency. Other Bitcoin trading platforms popular in China are FXBTC.com and Btctrade.com. Regulators in China have so far ignored Bitcoins. \u201cThe advantage for Chinese users to use Bitcoin is freedom,\u201d says Patrick Lin, system administrator at an Internet company and owner of about 1,500 Bitcoins. \u201cPeople can do something without any official authority.\u201d Lin says he\u2019s sticking to the currency itself rather than investing in Bitcoin companies, in part because of weak regulation. \u201cThe Bitcoin world is just like the Wild West.

You can join drug dealers, speculators, and the curious by hopping onto an online exchange and purchasing one unit of the digital currency for, as of Nov. 11, about $340. But you can get Bitcoins for free by mining them, and a new breed of chips will soon make doing that a lot faster. \u201cYou would need 70,000 Intel chips to equal what one of ours can do,\u201d says Eduardo de Castro, co-founder of Bitcoin chipmaker HashFast Technologies.  Each Bitcoin has to be verified on a virtual ledger of all the Bitcoins ever circulated. Anyone can download some software and get a copy of this ledger, but to add to it, you must become a Bitcoin miner. That means you set your computer to work performing cryptographic calculations to decode elements of the currency system and confirm the validity of transactions, which then get added to the main record. The reward for this work is about 25 Bitcoins. The catch: Only one person every 10 minutes earns this prize, by solving the calculations before anyone else. Mining Bitcoins is already a specialist\u2019s game. Butterfly Labs and KnCMiner build special Bitcoin-mining hardware that they sell to individuals and groups of people who pool their money to amass lots of computers. Then there\u2019s the Bitcoin discussion forum user known as BitFury, believed to be a self-taught chip designer from Ukraine, who \u201cdesigned a chip at his kitchen table,\u201d de Castro says. \u201cHe\u2019s made a huge pile of cash\u201d by selling machines using the chips on his website. BitFury and other first-wave Bitcoin hardware makers will face competition in 2014 from a second wave of designers, who aim to speed the mining process with special chips known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. The circuits\u2019 creators include HashFast, which has used cutting-edge chip design techniques to produce computers that sell for $11,700 each. CoinTerra has raised $1.5 million; its chief executive officer, Ravi Iyengar, used to design chips at Samsung Electronics and Nvidia. Secretive startup 21E6, another mining-machine seller, is believed to be backed by some of the wealthiest people in Silicon Valley; its co-founder is Balaji Srinivasan, a former Stanford University professor and data-mining expert. The latest and greatest equipment from these companies should begin arriving in December, kicking off what the startups hope will be a massive spending spree by Bitcoin miners. \u201cIt really is an arms race,\u201d says David Kanter, a chip analyst and consultant. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of the first people to get one of these, then boom, you will make some real money. But once everyone has one, it\u2019s back to square one.\u201d Individual miners who get outspent by larger groups will end up with basically worthless hardware unless they can pool it into something larger, he says. As he says about BitFury, \u201cI am sure he made more money from the hardware than the morons who bought.\u201d \n ', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/valleyhack', 'name': u'Ashlee Vance', 'twitterhandle': u'valleyhack'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-14/2014-outlook-bitcoin-mining-chips-a-high-tech-arms-race', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 15, 4, 12, 3, 458000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Mining Chips, a High-Tech Arms Race'}, {'articleText': u' Let\u2019s stipulate that Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that went offline on Feb.\xa025 and seems to have misplaced about 365\xa0million of its customers\u2019 dollars, might be \u201cthe worst-run business in the history of the world,\u201d as one Bitcoin investor recently said. Smart regulation might have made a difference\u2014and as digital currencies proliferate, getting that regulation right will only become more important. So far, countries have taken three main approaches to regulating Bitcoin and other digital currencies. The first is to outlaw them or severely restrict their use, as Russia and China are doing. This isn\u2019t irrational, but it could prevent needed innovation. The second is to do nothing, as Japan did. Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, showcases the wisdom of that strategy. A third and better approach: The U.S. and others are seeking to encourage digital currencies as long as they follow the rules. Therein lies the rub. The rules are manifold and onerous for companies that want to transmit money. They have to follow laws intended to prevent money laundering, terrorism, and tax evasion. In the U.S., they have to appease state regulators and federal overseers. And they have to assure consumers that they are reliable and secure enough to handle their money. Yet several U.S. regulators have been receptive to rethinking how this regulation should apply in the age of digital currencies. Benjamin Lawsky, New York State\u2019s superintendent of financial services, deserves credit for suggesting a \u201cBitLicense\u201d for digital currency companies. This would offer a much clearer framework for disclosing risks, protecting consumers, and preventing crimes. The goal isn\u2019t to create burdensome requirements just for digital currencies\u2014it\u2019s to think about how to address the same issues the old laws addressed, but in a more modern and flexible way. Another Mt. Gox might still arise under such a system, but customers would at least have a better idea of the risks involved. Bitcoin may not work in reality, but it is still an idea whose time had come. Paying for things using credit and debit cards is expensive, and moving money from one place to another, especially overseas, is cumbersome. Bitcoin\u2019s developers, in creating a peer-to-peer payment system that records all transactions on a public ledger, took an elegant approach to solving these and other problems. Unfortunately, Bitcoin\u2019s clever payment system is yoked to a volatile and deflationary pseudo-currency, prone to security flaws, attractive to criminals, and unreliable as a store of value, unit of account, or investment opportunity. Yet in showing the way for other payment innovators and in getting regulators to think creatively and ambitiously about how the money-moving business might be disrupted in the Digital Age, Bitcoin\u2019s designers and backers are performing a valuable service. Sadly, many had to lose their shirts in doing so.

In the days prior to Thanksgiving 2013, someone installed malware in Target\u2019s security and payments system designed to steal every credit card used at the company\u2019s 1,797 U.S. stores. At the critical moment\u2014when the Christmas gifts had been scanned and bagged and the cashier asked for a swipe\u2014the malware would step in, capture the shopper\u2019s credit card number, and store it on a Target server commandeered by the hackers.   On Saturday, Nov. 30, the hackers had set their traps and had just one thing to do before starting the attack: plan the data\u2019s escape route. As they uploaded exfiltration malware to move stolen credit card numbers\u2014first to staging points spread around the U.S. to cover their tracks, then into their computers in Russia\u2014FireEye spotted them. Bangalore got an alert and flagged the security team in Minneapolis. And then \u2026\xa0Nothing happened. For some reason, Minneapolis didn\u2019t react to the sirens. Bloomberg Businessweek spoke to more than 10 former Target employees familiar with the company\u2019s data security operation, as well as eight people with specific knowledge of the hack and its aftermath, including former employees, security researchers, and law enforcement officials. The story they tell is of an alert system, installed to protect the bond between retailer and customer, that worked beautifully. But then, Target stood by as 40 million credit card numbers\u2014and 70 million addresses, phone numbers, and other pieces of personal information\u2014gushed out of its mainframes. When asked to respond to a list of specific questions about the incident and the company\u2019s lack of an immediate response to it, Target Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel issued an e-mailed statement: \u201cTarget was certified as meeting the standard for the payment card industry (PCI) in September 2013. Nonetheless, we suffered a data breach. As a result, we are conducting an end-to-end review of our people, processes and technology to understand our opportunities to improve data security and are committed to learning from this experience. While we are still in the midst of an ongoing investigation, we have already taken significant steps, including beginning the overhaul of our information security structure and the acceleration of our transition to chip-enabled cards. However, as the investigation is not complete, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s constructive to engage in speculation without the benefit of the final analysis.\u201d More than 90 lawsuits have been filed against Target by customers and banks for negligence and compensatory damages. That\u2019s on top of other costs, which analysts estimate could run into the billions. Target spent $61 million through Feb. 1 responding to the breach, according to its fourth-quarter report to investors. It set up a customer response operation, and in an effort to regain lost trust, Steinhafel promised that consumers won\u2019t have to pay any fraudulent charges stemming from the breach. Target\u2019s profit for the holiday shopping period fell 46 percent from the same quarter the year before; the number of transactions suffered its biggest decline since the retailer began reporting the statistic in 2008. \n March 13 (Bloomberg) -- It was only after federal officials notified Target of unusual cyber activity involving credit card payments at Target stores that a squad of company investigators went back to find out what happened. As they pored over computer logs, team members found alerts from the weeks before warning that hackers had installed malware.  The hackers would go on to steal credit card info and ultimately compromise the personal information of as many as 70 million consumers. Here's a look at the timeline of the cyber-breach that has since engulfed Target, prompted congressional hearings and led to an international manhunt for the hackers. (Source: Bloomberg)  In testimony before Congress, Target has said that it was only after the U.S. Department of Justice notified the retailer about the breach in mid-December that company investigators went back to figure out what happened. What it hasn\u2019t publicly revealed: Poring over computer logs, Target found FireEye\u2019s alerts from Nov. 30 and more from Dec. 2, when hackers installed yet another version of the malware. Not only should those alarms have been impossible to miss, they went off early enough that the hackers hadn\u2019t begun transmitting the stolen card data out of Target\u2019s network. Had the company\u2019s security team responded when it was supposed to, the theft that has since engulfed Target, touched as many as one in three American consumers, and led to an international manhunt for the hackers never would have happened at all.\xa0\xa0The heart of Target\u2019s antihacking operation is cloistered in a corner room on the sixth floor of a building in downtown Minneapolis. There are no internal-facing windows, just a locked door. Visitors ring a bell, then wait for a visual scan before being buzzed in. If you\u2019ve seen one security operations center, or SOC, you\u2019ve essentially seen them all. Inside, analysts sit in front of rows of screens that monitor Target\u2019s billion-dollar IT infrastructure. Government agencies often build their own SOCs, as do big banks, defense contractors, tech companies, wireless carriers, and other corporations with centralized stockpiles of high-value information. Retailers, however, tend not to. Most still focus on their primary mission, selling stuff\u2014in part because their sprawling networks of stores and e-tailing entry points are difficult to lock down against incursions. A three-year study by Verizon Enterprise Solutions found that companies discover breaches through their own monitoring in only 31 percent of cases. For retailers, it\u2019s 5 percent. They\u2019re the wildebeests of the digital savannah. Target was striving to be different. Company officials say its information security staff now numbers more than 300 people\u2014a tenfold increase since 2006, says one of the chain\u2019s former information security managers. Less than a year before the Thanksgiving attack, Target brought in FireEye, a security software company in Milpitas, Calif., that was initially funded by the CIA and is used by intelligence agencies around the world.\n  On Nov. 30, according to a person who has consulted on Target\u2019s investigation but is not authorized to speak on the record, the hackers deployed their custom-made code, triggering a FireEye alert that indicated unfamiliar malware: \u201cmalware.binary.\u201d Details soon followed, including addresses for the servers where the hackers wanted their stolen data to be sent. As the hackers inserted more versions of the same malware (they may have used as many as five, security researchers say), the security system sent out more alerts, each the most urgent on FireEye\u2019s graded scale, says the person who has consulted on Target\u2019s probe. \n \u201cThe malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting,\u201d says Jim Walter, director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee  The breach could have been stopped there without human intervention. The system has an option to automatically delete malware as it\u2019s detected. But according to two people who audited FireEye\u2019s performance after the breach, Target\u2019s security team turned that function off. Edward Kiledjian, chief information security officer for Bombardier Aerospace, an aircraft maker that has used FireEye for more than a year, says that\u2019s not unusual. \u201cTypically, as a security team, you want to have that last decision point of \u2018what do I do,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. But, he warns, that puts pressure on a team to quickly find and neutralize the infected computers. Target had done a months-long test of FireEye that ended in May and was rolling out the technology throughout the company\u2019s massive IT system. It\u2019s possible that FireEye was still viewed with some skepticism by its minders at the time of the hack, say two people familiar with Target\u2019s security operations. And the SOC manager, Brian Bobo, departed the company in October, according to his LinkedIn page, leaving a crucial post vacant. (Bobo declined to comment.) Yet it was clear Target was getting warnings of a serious compromise. Even the company\u2019s antivirus system, Symantec Endpoint Protection, identified suspicious behavior over several days around Thanksgiving\u2014pointing to the same server identified by the FireEye alerts. \u201cThe malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting,\u201d says Jim Walter, director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee. If Target had had a firm grasp on its network security environment, he adds, \u201cthey absolutely would have observed this behavior occurring on its network.\u201d Target\u2019s security blunders don\u2019t end there. Its spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, says the intruders had gained access to the system by using stolen credentials from a third-party vendor. Brian Krebs, a security blogger whose site krebsonsecurity.com first broke the news of the Target hack, has reported that the vendor was a refrigeration and heating company near Pittsburgh called Fazio Mechanical Services. A statement on Fazio\u2019s website says its IT systems and security measures are in compliance with industry practices, and its data connection to Target was purely for billing, contract submission, and project management. Target\u2019s system, like any standard corporate network, is segmented so that the most sensitive parts\u2014including customer payments and personal data\u2014are walled off from other parts of the network and, especially, the open Internet. Target\u2019s walls obviously had holes. The hackers\u2019 malware disguised itself with the name BladeLogic, probably to mimic a component in a data center management product, according to a report by Dell SecureWorks. (SecureWorks is one of many cybersecurity firms that got their hands on the Target malware, which was made public on various websites used by researchers to help other companies fend off similar attacks.) In other words, the hackers cloaked their bad code with the name of legitimate software used by companies to protect cardholder and payment data. Once their malware was successfully in place on Nov. 30\u2014the data didn\u2019t actually start moving out of Target\u2019s network until Dec. 2\u2014the hackers had almost two weeks to pillage credit card numbers unmolested. According to SecureWorks, the malware was designed to send data automatically to three different U.S. staging points, working only between the hours of 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Central Standard Time. That was presumably to make sure the outbound data would be submerged in regular working-hours traffic. From there the card information went to Moscow. Seculert, an Israeli security firm, was able to analyze the hackers\u2019 activity on one of the U.S.-based staging points, which showed them eventually taking 11 gigabytes of data stored there to a Moscow-based hosting service called vpsville.ru. Alexander Kiva, spokesman for vpsville.ru, says the company has too many clients to monitor them effectively, and that it hadn\u2019t been contacted by U.S. investigators as of February. If Target\u2019s security team had followed up on the earliest FireEye alerts, it could have been right behind the hackers on their escape path. The malware had user names and passwords for the thieves\u2019 staging servers embedded in the code, according to Jaime Blasco, a researcher for the security firm AlienVault Labs. Target security could have signed in to the servers themselves\u2014located in Ashburn, Va., Provo, Utah, and Los Angeles\u2014and seen the stolen data sitting there waiting for the hackers\u2019 daily pickup. But by the time company investigators figured that out, the data were long gone.   The guts of the malware code provided some intriguing leads. One of the passwords was Crysis1089. That happens to be the nickname of an Xbox gamer. (His rank on the Xbox Live global leaderboard as of March 10: 11,450,001.) It also appears to be a reference to the October 1989 date of mass protests that preceded Ukrainian independence and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. There was another name embedded in the exfiltration code: Rescator. The alias, a reference to a pirate in the 1967 French film Indomptable Ang\xe9lique, belongs to a prolific Ukrainian trafficker in stolen credit card numbers. Rescator operates several online card number sites\u2014cheapdumps.org and Lampeduza.la, to name two\u2014that use the country domains of Laos, Somalia, and the former Soviet Union, among others. Rescator isn\u2019t the only reseller pushing the stolen Target data, but according to Krebs and several other security investigators, he\u2019s the most active, apparently operating with impunity out of the Black Sea port of Odessa.\xa0\xa0  The U.S. Justice Department worked with European law enforcement agencies to shut down Carderplanet in the mid-2000s. All that did was move Odessa\u2019s carder scene underground. The ringleaders of today\u2019s carding operations \u201cnever meet, they never know each other\u2019s names,\u201d says Ilya Zadorozhko, one of the deans of Odessa\u2019s hacker community, who currently makes his living aboveboard, as a network specialist for a Dutch IT group. \u201cThere are only private messages, strictly anonymous.\u201d And there are assumed names, such as Rescator. In posts to vor.cc, an online forum for Russian hackers, Rescator said he had also gone by the nickname Helkern. Photos, e-mail addresses, and other details that Helkern posted online show a 22-year-old from Odessa named Andrey Khodyrevskiy. An in-house blog at Netpeak, an Odessa marketing company where Khodyrevskiy once worked, confirms that he went by the nickname Helkern. A photo of a Helkern, posted on a website called Darklife that was co-founded by a person using the nickname, was identified by Netpeak\u2019s CEO as Khodyrevskiy. Still, there\u2019s no definitive proof that Rescator and Khodyrevskiy are the same person. Krebs, the security blogger who first disclosed the Target hack, reported that when he sent an instant message to one of Rescator\u2019s addresses, asking to speak with \u201cRescator a/k/a Andrey,\u201d he got a reply from someone asking why he wanted to contact that person. Later he got a message from Rescator\u2019s address offering him $10,000 not to publish his article, which identified Rescator as Khodyrevskiy. U.S. Secret Service Special Agent Brian Leary, spokesman for the cybercrime unit, says the agency could not comment on whether it was investigating the identity of Rescator or had linked the carder site to a particular individual. There is proof that Khodyrevskiy is a hacker, if not an accomplished one. One morning in February 2011, users of Odesskiy Forum, a popular Odessa Web portal, awoke to find the site riddled with error messages. Administrators swiftly determined that a hacker had planted malware on the site and stolen the e-mail addresses of 190,000 users. Breaking in was easy, because an administrator\u2019s password had been left visible in a rarely used part of the portal\u2014\u201can awful mistake,\u201d owner Dmitriy Kozin says. Still, it was hard to understand why anyone would want to hack a site that offers a blend of local news, Craigslist-type advertising, and discussion groups on everything from philosophy to pet grooming\u2014and doesn\u2019t store any financial data or other sensitive information. The Odesskiy Forum hacker screwed up: He streamed the stolen e-mail addresses to a proxy server that didn\u2019t have enough capacity to absorb them all. Some data spilled over into the hacker\u2019s own computer, exposing his IP address. Kozin alerted Ukrainian security police, and within days they\u2019d made an arrest: Khodyrevskiy. He was convicted and received a three-year suspended sentence. Kozin, for one, finds it hard to believe that this inept small-time hacker could have masterminded one of the biggest credit card heists ever. \u201cHe was lame, really unprofessional,\u201d he says.   Bloomberg Businessweek was unable to reach Khodyrevskiy. E-mail and instant messages sent to addresses he\u2019s used bounced back or went unanswered. A cell phone he used previously has been disconnected. There was no trace of him at the downtown Odessa address for Ghost.ua, a Web hosting company he ran for a time. Four consultants familiar with the Target probe say it\u2019s likely that Rescator wrote the Target malware. The word \u201cRescator\u201d ended up in the Target code by mistake: It\u2019s the name of the home directory of the computer on which the code was compiled. For Zadorozhko, the reformed hacker, the fact that an alias showed up in the Target malware suggests that Rescator was, at best, a low-level \u201cmonkey\u201d in the operation who was merely given blocks of the stolen cards to sell. \u201cNobody who is serious would do such a stupid thing as to put his name there,\u201d he says. All this means is that it\u2019s unlikely someone with Rescator\u2019s skill set would have acted alone. Modern computer crime is often a group affair, committed by gangs whose members bring different capabilities to the caper. In recent congressional testimony, William Noonan, deputy special agent in charge of the Secret Service\u2019s cybercrime investigations division, likened it to the movie Ocean\u2019s Eleven. To apply the comparison to the Target hack, Rescator may have been George Clooney\u2014the ringleader who recruited other criminals with the real skills. Rescator wrote the code, investigators suggest, then worked with a group of more expert hackers who breached the network and removed the data. The group he worked with are relative newcomers, and the network of servers they used, along with other clues, connect them to at least six other data thefts over the last two years, investigators say. Rescator\u2019s flagship site for selling illicit credit card numbers, Rescator.so, is unadorned\u2014no logos, no background images, all business, and extremely user-friendly. Shoppers can buy individual card numbers or load up by the thousands and get a bulk discount. Drop-down menus filter by geographic region, as well as by bank and type of card (ATM, American Express Blue, Visa, etc.). You can also filter by expiration date, last four digits, and city. That last feature is particularly impressive, says Mark Lanterman, a former member of the Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force who now runs his own digital forensics company, Computer Forensic Services, in Minnetonka, Minn. \u201cFraudsters want to buy credit cards for areas where they live,\u201d he says, to foil banks\u2019 fraud monitoring. If a card number attached to a billing address in New Jersey suddenly shows up in Stockholm, that\u2019s a red flag. Lanterman says that 10 years ago, during the era of Carderplanet, websites like Rescator\u2019s were public. Now you have to apply for credentials. Lanterman got his after lurking on black market forums, building a presence and a persona as a player in the carder underground. \u201cYou just hang out,\u201d he says. \u201cEventually they just think you\u2019re the same kind of scumbag they are and say, \u2018Yep, here\u2019s your login.\u2019\u2009\u201d \n Rescator may have been like George Clooney in Ocean\u2019s Eleven\u2014the ringleader who recruited other criminals with the real skills. He wrote the code, then worked with a group of more expert hackers to remove the data  Sitting in his conference room, Lanterman pulls up Rescator.so on his laptop\u2019s browser and shows a drop-down menu of cards for sale. He enters towns and cities. For Minnetonka, about 12 miles from Target\u2019s headquarters with a population of 51,000, there are 7,000 cards for sale. For another Minneapolis suburb, Plymouth, population 73,000, there are 5,335 cards available. Fayetteville, Ark.: 3,685. Torrington, Conn.: 5,115. The cards run from $6 apiece for a prepaid gift card to almost $200 for an American Express Platinum, and Rescator accepts payment in Bitcoin and Western Union. The return period\u2014just in case some of the cards don\u2019t work\u2014is six hours, according to the site\u2019s Replace Policy page, which is printed in Russian and English for better customer service. Long before six hours elapse, thieves can have the stash of stolen numbers printed on counterfeit cards and charge up a storm of purchases at stores or online, often in the form of gift cards that are easily transformed into cash. Eventually a bank catches wind of the fraud and freezes the card. For the thief, it\u2019s on to the next one. \xa0\xa0Target first publicly confirmed the breach in a press release at 6 a.m. on Dec. 19. Kelly Warpechowski, a 23-year-old IT recruiter in Milwaukee, already knew something was wrong. Her bank notified her that someone in Russia had spent $900 at \u201can oil company\u201d using her card. Target had been Warpechowski\u2019s go-to store, but she says she\u2019s visited only twice since. That night, Jamie Doyle, who\u2019s in the Navy and lives in Chesapeake, Va., got a fraud alert from the Navy Federal Credit Union while he was on overnight shipboard duty. His wife, Tracy, a school speech pathologist, checked the next morning and found their debit card had been drained, with more than $600 in pending charges. \u201cWe were literally going in to buy our Christmas dinner, and we had no money,\u201d she says. Jamie, who almost never shopped at Target, had used his debit card to grab $5 worth of groceries from a Chesapeake store on Black Friday. The card number was then used by thieves at an Ellicott City (Md.) Target store, Tracy says. She blames the retailer for the breach and for not checking more closely when the fraudulent user rang up the charges. Why didn\u2019t the cashier ask for ID to verify the cardholder, she wonders. The bank credited the Doyles\u2019 account in two days, Tracy says. She no longer shops at Target.   Sometime in early March someone broke into Rescator.so and stole the logins, passwords, and payment information of carders, then posted the data online. Krebs says it\u2019s unclear who was behind the hack, but it appears to be someone who wanted to shut the operation down, possibly vigilantes or competitors.", 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/MichaelRileyDC', 'name': u'Michael Riley', 'twitterhandle': u'MichaelRileyDC'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-13/target-missed-warnings-in-epic-hack-of-credit-card-data', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 17, 14, 31, 41, 353000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Missed Alarms and 40 Million Stolen Credit Card Numbers: How Target Blew It'}, {'articleText': u" It's ECB decision day, retail sales surge in the U.K.\xa0and all eyes on Valeant.

The euro\xa0dropped 0.3 percent to $1.1310 as of 10:45 a.m. in London. U.K. retail sales rose 1.9 percent in September, the most since December 2013 and far ahead of the 0.4 percent increase economists had forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The pound was 0.3 percent higher at $1.5460 at 10:50 a.m. London time, having risen as much as 0.6 percent when the data was published.\xa0 Yesterday was a dramatic day for Canadian drug company Valeant. The stock plunged around 40 percent after it was accused of Enron-like accounting. Shares\xa0recovered some of their losses after the company hit back against the claims, and major holder Bill Ackman confirmed that he bought more of the stock.\xa0Based on his recent disclosures, Ackman may have lost around $2.8 billion on his Valeant holdings. Unemployment in Spain fell to 21.2 percent in the third quarter, the lowest level since 2011. The data will give a boost to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's election campaign as it is the final unemployment reading ahead of the December 20 general election. Polling shows that the Spanish radical left party, Podemos, have dropped to fourth place, with new centrist party Ciudadanos rising. No party is polling high enough to form an overall majority.

He proposed building computer servers attached to satellites, loading them with data about everyday bitcoin transactions, and then launching those satellites into space.\xa0As one of the core developers of the virtual currency, Garzik was able to attract the attention of venture capitalists, who have been eager to throw cash at all sorts of bitcoin startups this year.\xa0However, the fundraising efforts failed. On Oct. 13, Garzik sent an e-mail to customers and partners, saying he\u2019d decided to place his startup,\xa0Dunvegan Space Systems,\xa0in a\xa0\u201cdeep freeze.\u201d The company was\xa0\u201cnowhere close to the necessary fundraising target,\u201d so it\xa0halted all\xa0\u201cspace-related marketing and operations,\u201d Garzik wrote.\xa0\u201cLet\u2019s look forward to the time when DSS is un-frozen, and we\u2019re getting back to lofting satellites and drones into space.\u201d A chill in bitcoin-related\xa0investments is not just affecting bizarre satellite-launching ventures. After an aggressive start to\xa02015 that entailed venture capitalists kicking $373 million into bitcoin startups in the first half of the year, growth slowed substantially in the third quarter, according to data from researcher CoinDesk. The $85 million in investments last quarter represents a relatively modest growth rate of 15 percent\xa0from a year earlier\xa0and\xa0a 41\xa0percent drop\xa0from the previous quarter. On Nov. 2, dozens of\xa0the most influential contributors to bitcoin\u2019s development\xa0will convene virtually on Bitcoin.com\u2019s Web forums as part of an event designed to answer questions about\xa0the digital currency\u2019s future. They\u2019ll have much to discuss. The total amount of\xa0venture capital invested in\xa0bitcoin companies is expected to surpass\xa0$1 billion by the end of October,\xa0according to Barry Silbert, a bitcoin bull and co-founder of SecondMarket, which is being acquired by Nasdaq. But the next milestone may come slower as investors tread cautiously.\xa0\u201cIt is natural that VCs are waiting to see whether their previous investments have panned out before increasing investment,\u201d said\xa0Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Some of the early bets have not panned out. Buttercoin, a bitcoin marketplace that went through Y Combinator\u2019s tech\xa0incubator, closed its\xa0doors\xa0this year, along with several other startups, while many survivors\xa0have\xa0merged so they can\xa0continue operating. BitPay, a bitcoin payment processor backed by Founders Fund and other\xa0venture firms, cut staff in September, affecting nearly 30 employees and contractors.\xa0\u201cWe have decided to restructure our workforce to better align ourselves with the pace of growth of the wider bitcoin economy,\u201d Stephen Pair, BitPay chief executive officer, wrote in an e-mailed statement. Bitcoin believers can be found among some of the highest-profile venture capitalists. Adam Draper\u2019s Boost VC has invested in numerous bitcoin startups, and his father, Tim, has promoted the digital currency as the future of money. \u201cOur Bitcoin companies are rocking, and there are lots of buyers and not many sellers of bitcoin out there,\u201d said Tim Draper, a founding partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson. \u201cThe transformation is here.\u201d Andreessen Horowitz\xa0backed\xa021, which makes\xa0bitcoin computers. Bloomberg LP is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz. The firm declined to comment about its investments in bitcoin, and Adam\xa0Draper didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A big source of the hard times for bitcoin startups is bitcoin itself. The price of the digital currency has declined 9.5 percent since the beginning of this year. Bitcoin Investment Trust, a publicly traded bitcoin fund created by Silbert, is down 35 percent since it listed in May. The hype has died down at online stores\xa0as well. After seeing huge growth in bitcoin sales last year, Web retailer Overstock.com said bitcoin transactions account for\xa0about 0.02 percent of sales this year, which is half of what they were in 2014. Investors are now more interested in bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology, called the\xa0blockchain. It\u2019s a mechanism for quickly and accurately recording transactions in an online ledger, and\xa0it could have important applications in banking and e-commerce to facilitate faster bank transfers or international transactions. On Oct. 14, bitcoin startup Bitreserve changed its name to\xa0Uphold and switched its focus\xa0to\xa0letting people transact in any form of money or commodity they choose, using the blockchain.\xa0\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pivoting of companies saying we want to build things for companies on the blockchain,\u201d said\xa0Michael Terpin, an investor in bitcoin who is backing\xa0more startups this year than he did in 2014. Terpin\u2019s faith hasn\u2019t wavered, and he said\xa0a slowdown isn\u2019t cause for alarm.\xa0\u201cThe rate of growth is slowing, and that\u2019s not a surprise,\u201d Terpin said.\xa0\u201cFor the most part, we are seeing a mild hiccup.\u201d He compared bitcoin to the dot-com bubble but said we aren\u2019t on the verge of bursting, at least not yet.\xa0\u201cNothing goes up forever,\u201d Terpin said.\xa0\u201cI don\u2019t think we are in a 2001 crash moment in bitcoin. We are in the 1997 inflection point.\u201d Garzik is similarly\xa0committed to bitcoin. His satellite project has a potential customer who may place an\xa0$18 million order in March 2016, which could revive the company. In the meantime, Garzik is working on a new startup called Bloq, which is exploring ways for\xa0\u201cprofessionalizing the entire bitcoin ecosystem.\u201d He described it as\xa0\u201ca more\u2014ahem\u2014down-to-earth bitcoin company.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/olgakharif', 'name': u'Olga Kharif', 'twitterhandle': u'olgakharif'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-26/the-bitcoin-startup-boom-comes-back-down-to-earth', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 26, 19, 22, 40, 978000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'The Bitcoin Startup Boom Comes Back Down to Earth'}, {'articleText': u' Bitcoin was built on the sort of open-source ethos that has driven generations of geeks. But the same principles it celebrates\u2014a decentralized network of contributors, a transparent code base\u2014are allowing competitors to flourish. The bitcoin faithful aren\u2019t so sure that\u2019s a good thing. Two high-profile bitcoin developers, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, released an alternative version of bitcoin over the weekend. In software parlance, this kind of offshoot is called a \u201cfork.\u201d Hearn acknowledged in a blog post that not everyone is thrilled with the endeavor. \u201cThe community is divided,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch a fork has never happened before.\u201d Actually, forking is a pretty common occurrence in software. After Google created Android, which has become the most popular smartphone operating system in the world, Amazon.com, Nokia, and other device manufacturers created their own versions, partly to differentiate their products. Google allows for some modifications to Android but tries to discourage drastic changes by withholding its app store from incompatible devices. Call it semi-open source. Many hugely successful programs started as forks, including the blogging platform WordPress and WebKit, which powers some of today\u2019s most popular Web browsers. But breaking off from an existing group of contributors to create a competing product \u201cis a practice that is considered as a last resort,\u201d according to a research report examining several hundred instances of forking. \u201cOur investigation shows, among other results, that forks occur in every software domain, that they have become more frequent in recent years, and that very few forks merge with the original project.\u201d The study found that nearly 44 percent of forks were successful; in nearly 30 percent of cases, the original software was discontinued, while 14 percent of the forks were eventually killed off. That\u2019s a solid track record. The new software, called Bitcoin XT, has much less support than the original, but it\u2019s gaining traction quickly. It already accounts for 8.4 percent of computers running bitcoin software, according to bitcoin tracker XTnodes. The price of bitcoin dipped slightly after Bitcoin XT\u2019s debut, perhaps reflecting concern that an alternative could hurt bitcoin\u2019s value. Many bitcoin supporters are opposed to an offshoot version for the same reasons that Linux and Android heads have voiced objections to similar projects in the past: They\xa0split the developer community, meaning fewer people are able to work on each version. Many forks also become incompatible with their predecessors. That could create unnecessary barriers for people with different currencies to exchange money. Despite the fervor in\xa0the bitcoin community, the odds are against Bitcoin XT. \u201cThis is not the first attempt to create a better bitcoin, but I believe bitcoin has such critical mass of resources devoted to it that it is unlikely anybody would abandon it for an incremental improvement,\u201dsays Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cNone has gotten much traction.\u201d If anything, some friendly competition could be good for bitcoin. \u201cForking can serve as a catalyst for innovation while simultaneously promoting better quality software through natural selection,\u201d according to a 2013 research paper.

Federal prosecutors say the 31-year-olds have since used their skills unlawfully. In indictments unsealed on July 21, Murgio is accused of running a Bitcoin exchange that laundered money for hackers. Aaron is accused of a pump-and-dump scam that used expertly crafted spam e-mails to lure investors into worthless penny stock purchases, generating $2.8 million in illicit profits. Although those indictments don\u2019t involve hacking, an FBI memo reviewed by Bloomberg also links the two men to last summer\u2019s cyber attack on JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest bank hacks in U.S. history. No one has pieced together how Aaron and Murgio may have gone from being promising business students to top-drawer cyber criminals, but there are hints of what may have happened along the way. Murgio racked up more than $500,000 in debt while trying to become a nightlife mogul, and Aaron moved to Israel and linked up with an alleged stock scammer. Friends and family say they\u2019re shocked by the charges. \u201cThey were always very business-minded but always very ethical and good people,\u201d says Drew White, a video producer and fraternity brother. Lawyers for Murgio declined to comment. It\u2019s unclear whether Aaron, who\u2019s still a fugitive, has an attorney. $2.8m: Profit Aaron is accused of helping generate illegally, using spam e-mail Murgio and Aaron met in 2002, their freshman year at Florida State. Aaron grew up in a brick colonial on a corner lot in the affluent Washington suburb of Potomac, Md. Murgio\u2019s family home sits on an acre abutting a private 18-hole golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla. Aaron\u2019s parents, Bob and Marsha, learned about the indictment hours after its unsealing and declined to comment. Murgio\u2019s father, Mike, a former high school principal who serves on the county school board, said friends would vouch for his son\u2019s \u201ctrustworthy and kind\u201d character. Both men had grown-up sensibilities at a young age, friends say: Neither did drugs, they were usually the designated drivers on nights out, and they were determined to become successful entrepreneurs. Murgio was outgoing and hammy, while Aaron was serious and reserved. In social media posts, Murgio called him \u201cthe Don.\u201d After a brief stint selling kitchen knives door-to-door, Aaron introduced Murgio and their fraternity brothers to \u201caffiliate marketing,\u201d a then-nascent business in which they crafted Google ads for companies willing to pay for traffic, taking a cut when people clicked. Friends say it was a popular job on campus, and Murgio later wrote on a personal Web page that he\u2019d \u201cstarted working for major corporations. Was flown all over the world, taken out to dinners all day and night\u2009\u2026\u2009lots of fun.\u201d Murgio, who also built vacation-rental websites, later said he\u2019d made $800,000 in college. He poured it into opening a restaurant and nightclub three blocks from campus after graduating in 2007. He was profiled in Tallahassee Magazine in 2010, and YouTube videos show long lines of students waiting to get into the club. Aaron dropped out in 2005 and relocated to Miami, where he started a series of companies in pricey Palmetto Bay. Among them were a maker of air purifiers, a home-security business, and an Internet marketing firm. He and Murgio stayed close. \u201cI still work with Josh, and we currently market many products on the Internet for various companies around the world,\u201d Murgio wrote on his personal Web page in 2013. Aaron left few traces online, unusual for an Internet marketer. His partner in a marketing firm he started in 2010 was a former securities broker previously banned for life by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for violations including marketing worthless technology stocks. According to Aaron\u2019s indictment, a year after starting the firm he was deep in a stock-fraud scheme with an Israeli friend, which continued into this year. Aaron had moved to Israel and married a tax lawyer he met there. His bachelor party in Amsterdam reunited some of the frat brothers, including Murgio. The wedding was Sept. 10, 2014, two weeks after it became public that the FBI was investigating a breach at JPMorgan. Starting around 2010, Murgio\u2019s nightlife business crumbled. He was in litigation with his landlord and was arrested in October 2011 after clashing with police over noise complaints. He filed for bankruptcy protection six months later, citing $545,000 in debt, and in early 2013 was arrested on charges that he stole $111,000 in unreported sales taxes his businesses collected. Murgio told friends it was a paperwork mistake, and the charges were dropped after he paid the taxes. Murgio and Aaron saw each other less after Aaron moved to Israel, but they did rendezvous in Russia Soon he was back on his feet. Murgio, who often posted about libertarian causes and uses a photo of himself with Ron Paul as his Facebook profile, registered the Coin.mx domain in October 2013 and started a Bitcoin exchange. \u201cHe is a bit ADD when it comes to new ideas. Comes up with a new one every day, then on to the next,\u201d says Taylor Wilson, an ex-girlfriend. \u201cHe liked the idea of Bitcoin, liked the principle behind it, but I don\u2019t know that it was his end-all. He is an entrepreneur, always will be.\u201d Prosecutors allege the Bitcoin exchange laundered illicit funds, including extortion payments made to hackers. In a 16-month period it exchanged a total of at least $1.8 million, according to court documents. \u201cAnyone who really knows him believes this is all a misunderstanding,\u201d Wilson says. Neither Murgio nor Aaron is accused of directly hacking JPMorgan. But the October FBI memo outlined some evidence linking them to the attack, including records of Aaron logging in to servers associated with the breach of the bank\u2019s main data center, where the hackers made off with personal data of 83 million customers over three months. Only relatively low-value data were removed, such as names, addresses, and e-mail addresses\u2014exactly what you\u2019d want for a pump-and-dump scheme, say three people familiar with the investigation. A group of elite Russian hackers that the people say teamed with the Florida State alums appears to have done the actual hacking, and the FBI hopes to use Murgio and Aaron to build the larger case. Murgio and Aaron saw each other less after Aaron moved to Israel, but they did rendezvous in Russia. Murgio visited Moscow at least a half-dozen times starting in 2014, drawing puzzled notes from Facebook friends. Court documents show he was working closely with Russian payment processors. Social media posts show him in selfies drinking vodka and soda and posed in front of the Kremlin and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He partied at the City Space Bar on the 34th floor of the lavish Swissotel Krasnye Holmy in downtown Moscow, and he posted a photo of himself smoking a hookah. \u201cDoesn\u2019t get better,\u201d he wrote in a caption. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t 25 degrees, I wouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d Aaron and his wife also traveled frequently to Russia starting in 2015. In a photo posted on social media accounts this year, he\u2019s wearing a Russian fur cap and posing in front of the Kremlin. He and his wife also drank at the City Space Bar. Aaron and Murgio met there in July. A photo shows them smiling as they dine along the Moscow River. Two weeks later, they were charged. Murgio was arrested in Tampa and is free on bond. Aaron\u2019s whereabouts are unknown. Friends of both men say it\u2019s unfathomable they would be involved in the crimes they\u2019re accused of. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around it,\u201d says frat brother White. \u201cThere must be something else going on here, or some kind of misunderstanding. They both just shared a passion for business.\u201d The bottom line: Murgio met bail. The whereabouts of Aaron, his fraternity brother and longtime collaborator, are unknown.

Its total area of approximately seven square kilometers would make it the third smallest sovereign state in the world, after the Vatican and Monaco. It's sandwiched between Croatia and Serbia on the western bank of the Danube River. On some maps, this area is referred to as \u201cGornja Siga.\u201d https://www.google.com/maps/place/45\xb046'00.0%22N+18\xb052'00.0%22E/@45.766658,18.8666667,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 \xa0 Not according to the founders. When the former Yugoslavia was split into new countries this small patch of land was forgotten about. Neither Croatia nor Serbia claimed it, making it a \u201cterra nullius\u201d or no man\u2019s land. A micronation is an entity that claims to be an independent nation, but is not officially recognized by world governments or major international organizations. Micronations are different from other kinds of social communes because they make a formal claim of sovereignty over a physical territory. The current president is Eurosceptic politician Jedlicka, 31, a member of the Czech Republic's Conservative Party of Free Citizens. Despite abstaining from Liberland\u2019s first presidential election, he was still elected by the two other founding members, one of whom is his girlfriend, and now the country\u2019s first lady. According to the founders the objective is to build a country where honest people can prosper with minimal interference from a centralized government. \u201cWe need more countries like Hong Kong, Singapore and Monaco, especially in Europe,\u201d Jedlicka says. \u201cWe really needed another tax heaven, not tax haven.\u201d All taxes will be voluntary, and the nation\u2019s services - such as power, healthcare and waste disposal - will be run either by private enterprises or through crowdfunding campaigns. Quite simply to have Liberland recognized by already-established nations as a sovereign state, paving the way for what the founders are calling a \u201cEuropean Singapore.\u201d To do this Jedlicka is appointing ambassadors from Liberland to countries all over the globe to drum up support for the idea. According to Jedlicka, Liberland has established embassies in several countries including the U.S., the U.K., France and the Czech Republic. He plans to open embassies in \u201ca hundred more countries by the end of the year.\u201d Liberland is attempting to use the homestead principle, which states that unclaimed and undeveloped land can be legally claimed by any group willing to develop it. But some legal experts have stated that even though the land may appear unclaimed, it is most probably already part of Serbia. Not yet. Croatian border police are arresting anyone who sets foot in Liberland. However, this has not deterred members of the Liberland Settlers Association, which attempts to reach it on a daily basis and often clashes with local police in the process. The Liberland Settlement Association (LSA) is an NGO based in Serbia, funded by the Liberland Settlement Corp. It is made up primarily of volunteers who attempt to maintain an active presence on Liberland to help it become a recognized country. According to CEO Niklas Nikolassen, the Liberland Settlement Corp. (LSC) \u201cis a group of liberty-minded investors who are funding the LSA.\u201d The corporation, based in Switzerland, has a claim on 80,000 square meters of Liberland and is hoping that the actions of the LSA will help Liberland achieve recognition as a sovereign state and thus make the land valuable.\xa0 Liberland has already received almost 400,000 applications for citizenship, however only around 45,000 of these are considered to be serious. According to Jedlicka there will probably be a total of 30,000-40,000 Liberlandians, not all of whom will actually live in Liberland. Liberland's government says it has already raised over $45,000 through crowdfunding on it's website, where they take donations in both regular currency and Bitcoin. This has paid for government offices in Praque and Serbia, a personal assistant for the president and his recent trips to the G-7 in Germany and Freedom Fest in the U.S.\xa0 (This story was corrected to say the corporation's claim within Liberland is 80,000 square meters.)", 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': u'Ed Kiernan', 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/inside-liberland-the-place-of-no-taxes-where-crowdfunding-rules', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 7, 21, 7, 1, 39, 965000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Inside \u2018Liberland,\u2019 the Place of No Taxes Where Crowdfunding Rules'}, {'articleText': u" Bitcoin is on a roll.

Earlier this year they sold several bottles on the online marketplace OpenBazaar using the technology that underlies bitcoin: the blockchain. The sale of the Vanderaars\u2019 honey was among the first e-commerce transactions to take advantage of the blockchain\u2014which in the most basic terms is a publicly viewable, online ledger that records a sale or trade of goods or services. It\u2019s seen as quicker, cheaper and safer, and that means items ranging from gold bars to concert tickets to even homes could all start moving through the blockchain, disrupting not just eBay Inc. but the banking, insurance and e-commerce industries. \u201cIt could replace most middlemen in most financial markets,\u201d Adam Draper, chief executive officer of Boost VC, a company investing in bitcoin startups, said in an e-mail. \u201cThat would amount to trillions of dollars. When institutions start to adopt blockchain technology, it will be world changing.\u201d The blockchain could record that the Vanderaars\u2019 bottles of honey\u2014or a more valuable asset, like a house\u2014changed hands by recording and authenticating the transaction in the ledger. But in the future, it could also track and ensure delivery while holding both parties accountable\u2014all by recording and authenticating the transaction in the ledger. And it\u2019s less susceptible to fraud: Unlike today\u2019s payments systems, the buyer never provides debit or credit card information to the seller. The payment is sent to the seller\u2019s digital-wallet address and handled by the blockchain.\xa0 Blockchain technology for selling assets and contracts, though in the works for more than a year, is also now starting to arrive. OpenBazaar, which received $1 million in funding from investors including Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz in June, is already testing its system with a limited number of users, and should launch by the holiday season, Brian Hoffman, the project lead for OpenBazaar, said in an interview. \u201cThe purchasing piece is working,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a small amount of sales on the network. I bought a pen from a guy in New Zealand.\u201d\xa0 One blockchain asset-trading builder, Colu, which raised $2.5 million in funding earlier this year, began beta testing in August. Among the companies developing apps for it are a ticket seller and a company selling gold bars, Amos Meiri, the company\u2019s CEO, said in an interview. Colu also is collaborating with Revelator, a cloud-based provider of sales and marketing intelligence for music businesses, to create a secure way to distribute digital assets including music copyright registration. \u201cOur vision is to make it simple for the end user,\u201d Meiri said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to use bitcoin addresses; you don\u2019t need to know what a bitcoin is.\u201d\xa0 While the base technology is typically free, some blockchain startups are trying to make money by selling their own currencies, and through donations.

The dumb money falls for investing fads, sells into market panics and pays ridiculous fees. The smart money doesn\'t. It\'s getting a lot harder to tell the two apart. More amateur investors have given up on trying to outsmart the market. And even the most sophisticated investors are rejecting strategies that require Ph.D-level math and managers with million-dollar salaries. Leading the way this week is the U.S.\'s largest pension. The $298-billion California Public Employees\' Retirement System, or Calpers, is ditching all of its hedge funds -- $4 billion worth. The dramatic move isn\u2019t tied to performance, though that\'s been lousy. It\'s to "reduce the complexity [and] costs in the program," interim chief investment officer Ted Eliopoulos told Bloomberg.  Cut cost and complexity -- it\u2019s a slogan that fits on a bumper sticker, and it\u2019s being adopted by investors large and small. It took a while for this argument to go mainstream. Index fund advocate John Bogle founded low-cost fund firm Vanguard Group Inc. in 1975. Now trillions of dollars are following Bogle\'s advice. The Boston Consulting Group estimates the market share of index funds and exchange-traded funds, designed for simplicity and low fees, has doubled since 2003. Vanguard itself has almost $3 trillion in assets, making it the world\'s second-biggest money manager after BlackRock Inc., the biggest provider of ETFs.  Investing programs are getting easier than pie. With a target-date fund, for example, a 401(k) investor no longer needs to know the difference between a stock and bond. These all-in-one funds, which automatically adjust risk levels as workers approach retirement, are taking over retirement plans, and are the favorite of young workers. At the end of last year, $618 billion sat in target-date funds, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) says, up from $160 billion in 2008. The ultimate in idiot-proof investing is a new raft of start-up online advisers, sometimes called \u201crobo-advisors.\u201d These firms, which include Wealthfront and Betterment, design extremely simple and slimmed-down web sites and put all clients in cheap, basic index funds and exchange-traded funds. Unlike established discount brokers such as Charles Schwab Corp., the new firms pare away "a million features that only five percent of the user base actually wants," says Grant Easterbrook of consulting firm Corporate Insight. Eleven start-ups were advising $15.7 billion in assets in July, Corporate Insight says. That\'s a small slice of the investing universe. But that\u2019s a 36.5 percent gain since April, which works out to an annual growth rate of 250 percent. And major brokers have noticed. Schwab has hinted it\u2019s working on its own robo-adviser platform.  Both big established players like Calpers and the hot new start-ups use the same investing mantra: Cut costs and simplify. It\u2019s working. Fees are falling, with the average expense ratio on an equity mutual fund down 25 percent in 10 years, ICI data show. That means even dumb-as-a-post investors get to keep more of their money. And that\'s pretty smart.

The government will amend the Bank Act to create \u201cexplicit regulation-making authority\u201d over banks that trade standard derivatives, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said in his budget released today in Ottawa. The move may broaden the powers of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, which currently regulates some aspects of derivatives trading. Canada is trying to prevent improper trading in the nation\u2019s financial markets and reduce risk in its housing market and banking industry, which has already been ranked the world\u2019s soundest by the World Economic Forum. The government is also trying to promote competition by bolstering smaller banks. Canada plans to eventually assign oversight of derivatives trading to its proposed national securities regulator. The changes will make it easier for Canada to bring its regulations in line with foreign agencies such as the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, according to the budget. \u201cThis is a sign of things to come, as Canada and other jurisdictions try to impose more transparency on the darker corners of derivatives,\u201d said David Tulk, chief macro strategist for TD Securities. \u201dIt does ultimately reinforce the stability of the financial system.\u201d The government said it will step up regulation of financial benchmarks set by banks, a change that could affect how the Canadian dollar offered rate, also known as CDOR, is set. The rate is based on submissions by banks and is used as a benchmark for derivatives. Canadian banks shouldn\u2019t have difficulty adjusting to the new rules given the international financial regulations with which they\u2019ve already complied, Tulk said today in Ottawa. The budget also takes more steps to insulate taxpayers from a downturn in the nation\u2019s housing market. The Bank of Canada has identified record household debt as the biggest domestic risk to the financial system. Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp., a government-owned housing agency, will reduce the amount of portfolio mortgage insurance it provides this year to $9 billion ($8.1 billion) from C$11 billion, according to the budget. CMHC will also pay guarantee fees to the federal government starting this year to compensate for mortgage insurance risks. Private insurers already pay these fees. CMHC insures mortgages against default, and its insurance is fully backed by the federal government. By law, Canadian mortgages that have less than a 20 percent down payment must be insured. Financial institutions often buy such insurance in bulk so they can repackage home loans as securities for investors. The government said it will reduce the amount of mortgage-backed securities it guarantees from C$135 billion last year to C$120 billion in 2014. Canada will also review its deposit-insurance system, according to the budget. Currently, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corp. covers up to C$100,000 of an individual\u2019s savings in the event a bank fails. In addition, the government will introduce legislation to crack down on money laundering and terrorist financing through the use of unconventional currencies such as Bitcoin. To boost competition in the finance industry, the government will make it easier for small banks to access funding from CMHC. The budget also proposes steps to make it easier for new banks to be established and to ease mergers of credit unions.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-11/canada-to-increase-regulation-of-over-the-counter-derivatives', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 11, 21, 9, 57, 665000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Canada to Increase Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin advocates entered Washington a year ago with the shadow of a federal criminal investigation cast over the virtual currency industry. Their first mission: Win over, or at least not alarm, the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, called Fincen. \u201cOur first reaction, particularly when I was on the law enforcement side, when we had something new was \u2018Huge risk! Huge risk for money laundering. It\u2019s bad!\u2019\u201d Fincen Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery said in an interview this week. \u201cBut we\u2019re the Department of the Treasury, we can\u2019t have that knee-jerk of a response.\u201d In March, Fincen issued rules stating that Bitcoin businesses may be considered money transmitters, which must abide by anti-money-laundering laws. The industry welcomed the move because it provided a road map for complying with regulations, and helped erode Bitcoin\u2019s reputation as an enabler of illicit transactions. That was the \u201cstarting-gun shot\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s activities in Washington, said Marco Santori, chairman of the Seattle-based Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s regulatory affairs committee, who said he met with Shasky Calvery. After starting 2013 with no Washington presence, Bitcoin now has its own foundation and industry representatives as ambassadors to Capitol Hill. It\u2019s being courted for business by professional lobbyists. Adrian Fenty, Washington\u2019s former mayor now with the legal firm Perkins Coie, is helping develop a political strategy, at the same time fans of Ron Paul, a former libertarian-leaning Republican who ran for president in 2012, are turning up the buzz around Bitcoin. The outreach is aimed at ensuring that wary lawmakers don\u2019t kill the embryonic industry and regulators provide a clear set of rules to play by. A pair of mostly friendly Senate hearings in November showed Bitcoin\u2019s early Washington moves -- though decentralized like the currency itself -- are working so far. Even Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who in June 2011 described Bitcoin as \u201can online form of money laundering,\u201d sounded more upbeat about its prospects. \u201cAs a rapidly growing hub for technology and venture capital, New York has every interest in building on the promise that technologies like Bitcoin have to revolutionize payment systems, or even form the building blocks for whole new technology platforms,\u201d Schumer said during a Nov. 19 hearing. The currency\u2019s rapid rise in value, from about $13 per Bitcoin in January 2013 to about $840 yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, also is helping to push it onto Washington\u2019s radar. Yet some lobbyists, many of whom want to represent Bitcoin ventures, warn that as the virtual currency\u2019s popularity broadens, such powerful industries with well-established Washington operations as banking and credit-card companies might begin to turn on a perceived threat. \u201cWith the Senate hearings, they may have awoken a sleeping giant who is less enamored with virtual currency than they are,\u201d said Heather Podesta, a lobbyist who is seeking clients in the Bitcoin realm. \u201cAs with any new industry they\u2019ll probably have to play some defense as people begin to raise questions.\u201d Bitcoin, created five years ago by an anonymous programmer or programmers known as Satoshi Nakamoto, exists as strings of computer code. \u201cMiners\u201d unlock new Bitcoins by using ever-faster computers to solve complex mathematical problems. The will only be 21 million Bitcoins created, a ceiling that potentially enhances each one\u2019s value. Its decentralized and limited production appeals to investors and libertarians in the way that gold does, although skeptics see little more than a new financial bubble. The foundation, which tech entrepreneur Peter Vessenes began in July 2012, says on its website that its mission is to standardize, protect and promote Bitcoin. The organization has members representing the biggest investors and companies in the industry, including Lightspeed Venture Partners, a Menlo Park, California venture capital firm, and Bitcoin Investment Trust, a virtual currency fund run by New York-based SecondMarket Inc. The foundation employs an executive director, a finance director, general counsel and a Washington-based spokeswoman -- all paid in Bitcoins. The Washington employee, Jinyoung Lee Englund, was a scheduling aide to Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington State Republican. Englund worked on Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, and at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based group that promotes reduced government regulation. Patrick Murck, the foundation\u2019s general counsel, works out of Seattle and said he is in Washington about one week per month. Murck previously worked at a Washington-based law firm that specializes in telecommunications issues. Also working the halls of Congress and regulating agencies for Bitcoin are investor representatives. Jeremy Allaire, of Circle Internet Financial, which received the second largest venture capital investment in Bitcoin, testified in November at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing. Perkins Coie, which also employs President Barack Obama\u2019s former White House counsel Bob Bauer, doesn\u2019t lobby but does provide legal services and strategic advice for the foundation and an estimated 90 percent of the Bitcoin industry, said Lowell Ness, a partner based in Palo Alto, California. He said the firm has about 20 employees focused on Bitcoin. Among them is Fenty, who moved to California after losing his 2010 re-election as mayor of the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cHe\u2019s our ace in the hole in terms of DC strategy,\u201d Ness said about Fenty\u2019s work on Bitcoin for Perkins Coie. \u201cHe can connect us with just about anybody.\u201d Fenty also is an adviser to Andreessen Horowitz, which in December made the largest venture capital investment, $25 million, in a business seeking to commercialize Bitcoin. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz, founded by technology industry veterans Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. The industry in October received one of its biggest breaks in Washington when the Federal Bureau of Investigation took down Silk Road, an online drug and weapon marketplace where users paid in Bitcoin. The resolution of the investigation without criticism of the virtual payments provided credibility that was followed by the encouraging Senate hearings. The Federal Election Commission now is weighing how to handle Bitcoin in the campaign-finance arena. Already several super-political action committees dedicated to Bitcoin have filed FEC paperwork, and Representative Steve Stockman, a Texas Republican, recently began accepting donations in Bitcoin to his Senate campaign. Nick Spanos, a former Paul activist and the head of a Republican data company, gave Stockman a tour of his Bitcoin education center in New York City on New Year\u2019s Eve. He said in an interview that Stockman \u201cgets it. Not all politicians have the ability to accept new concepts into their minds.\u201d One way to motivate them, he said: \u201cEveryone should send Bitcoin donations to their politicians.

Senior legal executives at the companies met Jan. 6 to\ndiscuss \u201csettlement opportunities,\u201d according to the agreement\nfiled Jan. 8 in federal court in San Jose.  The companies agreed to retain someone \u201cwho has experience\nmediating high-profile disputes,\u201d according to the filing,\nwhich doesn\u2019t name the person.  Apple and Samsung previously tried and failed to reach\nagreement in court-ordered settlement negotiations. In 2012, in\ntheir first patent-infringement case in San Jose, U.S.\nMagistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero handled negotiations. The\ncompanies also met at least twice in 2011 to discuss settling\ntheir dispute before the U.S. International Trade Commission,\naccording to a company filing.  In San Jose, Apple is again seeking an order banning sales\nin the U.S. of Samsung products that were at issue in the\ncompanies\u2019 first patent trial in California even though they are\nnow no longer on the market. Apple said in a court filing that\nit needed the injunction to deter Samsung from releasing new\nproducts that also infringed its patents.  The iPhone-maker last month asked U.S. District Judge Lucy\nKoh to bar sales of more than 20 smartphones and tablets that a\njury in 2012 found to infringe Apple\u2019s patents. Total damages\nowed by Samsung in that case stand at $930 million.  While Koh rejected Cupertino, California-based Apple\u2019s bid\nfor a sales ban on the infringing Samsung devices after the 2012\nverdict, a federal appeals court on Nov. 18 cleared the way for\nthe company to pursue an injunction targeting some Samsung\nproducts. Apple\u2019s second case against Samsung in San Jose is\nover newer models, including Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S III.  Adam Yates, a spokesman for Suwon, South Korea-based\nSamsung, declined to comment on the mediation. Kristin Huguet,\nan Apple spokeswoman, also declined to comment on it.  The lower court case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics\nCo. Ltd., 11-cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of\nCalifornia (San Jose). The appeals court case is Apple Inc. v.\nSamsung Electronics Co., 13-1129, U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit (Washington).  Nintendo Co., the maker of the Wii video-game console,\nbought at a sheriff\u2019s sale patents it was once accused of\ninfringing.  The Kyoto, Japan-based company said in a statement\nyesterday that it acquired the entire patent portfolio of IA\nLabs, which sued Nintendo for infringement in April 2010.  Nintendo prevailed in the infringement suit, and a federal\nappeals court upheld the lower court\u2019s ruling. IA Labs was\nordered to pay Nintendo\u2019s attorney fees and litigation costs and\nfailed to do so.  The game company bought Potomac, Maryland-based IA Labs\u2019\npatent portfolio at a Jan. 7 sale in Maryland\u2019s Montgomery\nCounty.  Nintendo, in a statement, called IA Labs a \u201cdefunct patent\ntroll.\u201d According to court papers, IA Labs was founded in 2002\nand originally known as Powergrid Fitness.

J&J Will Appeal China Ruling to Revoke Diabetes-Strip Trademark  Johnson & Johnson, the world\u2019s biggest maker of health-care\nproducts, said it will appeal a Chinese government agency ruling\nthat called for its trademark for the OneTouch diabetes test\nstrips to be revoked.  J&J will apply to a court \u201cfor judicial review and\ncancellation\u201d of the decision from China\u2019s State Administration\nof Industry and Commerce, it said in an e-mailed statement\nyesterday. The administration\u2019s trademark review board can\nremove the blood glucose meters from the market if the company\nhasn\u2019t filed a lawsuit within 30 days of the Dec. 27 ruling,\naccording to the state-owned China Daily.  Companies including Apple Inc. and Burberry Group Plc have\nfaced battles over brand rights in China. Apple paid $60 million\nin 2012 to settle a two-year-old dispute regarding the iPad\ntrademark in the Asian nation with Proview International\nHoldings Ltd., which had applied to Chinese customs to block\nlocal shipments of the U.S. company\u2019s tablets.  \u201cJohnson & Johnson, which has invested in the Chinese\nmarket under this brand for almost 10 years, is extremely\nshocked by the decision and is very disappointed,\u201d the company\nsaid in its statement on OneTouch.  The application against its trademark had been brought to\nthe trademark board via a Chinese company that previously\nproduced fake OneTouch test strips which were exported to the\nU.S. and other countries, J&J said.  J&J is also investigating producers and distributors of\nfake OneTouch test strips in China and \u201cwill continue to take\nactive measures to ensure that patients will not be harmed by\nfake products,\u201d it said.  J&J was fined by Chinese authorities last August, and two\nof its units were ordered to compensate a local distributor\nafter a court in Shanghai ruled that their setting of minimum\nresale prices constituted monopolistic conduct. China has been\nconducting a crackdown on the health-care industry that led to a\ncorruption probe into GlaxoSmithKline Plc.  The creators of the \u201cCoinye West\u201d virtual currency have\nbeen sent case-and-desist letters for the performer Kanye West,\nthe U.K.\u2019s Guardian newspaper reported.  The letters, sent to the coders who created the virtual\ncoins, accused them of attempting to trade on the reputation of\nWest, known for his rap music and his marriage to pop celebrity\nKim Kardashian, according to the Guardian.  The coders, who operate through the Coinyeco.in website,\nthen released their first \u201ccoins\u201d Jan. 7, saying \u201cwe want to\nrelease this to the public before the man can try to crush it,\u201d\nthe Guardian reported.  Counsel for West said in the letters to the coders that\nthey will sue any business that accepts the coins, and \u201cnotify\nthe cryptocurrency community\u201d of the actions the performer\nconsiders infringement of his trademarks, according to the\nnewspaper.

Major broadcasters are heading for a showdown in their bid\nto block a Barry Diller-backed company from upending the\nindustry\u2019s economics by offering subscribers live television\nover the Internet.  The U.S. Supreme Court will say as soon as tomorrow whether\nit will consider the claim by companies including Walt Disney\nCo.\u2019s ABC and 21st Century Fox Inc. that Aereo Inc.\u2019s business\nis built on copyright violations, obtaining broadcast signals\nfor free and distributing them for a profit.  Both sides in the dispute are seeking a high court hearing,\nincreasing the chances the justices will step in. If so, the\ncase will determine the fate of Aereo, a startup that threatens\nthe billions of dollars in retransmission fees broadcasters get\nfrom pay-TV systems that provide signals to subscribers.  A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo, which\nprovides broadcast signals to subscribers after capturing them\nwith thousands of small antennas, isn\u2019t violating broadcasters\u2019\ncopyrights. Comcast Corp.\u2019s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. are\njoining Disney and Fox in urging reversal.  A decision this month to take up the case may mean a\nSupreme Court ruling by early July. The justices might also ask\nthe Obama administration for input, a step that would delay a\nresolution.  The Supreme Court case is American Broadcasting Cos. v.\nAereo, 13-461.  Fullscreen Inc., a YouTube content provider, reached an\naccord with music publishers in a copyright suit over royalty\nnonpayment.  In a Jan. 8 court filing, the parties agreed to dismiss the\ncase. Terms were not disclosed in the court filing other than\nthe fact that all parties were to bear their own court costs and\nattorney fees.  The music publishers filed the infringement suit in federal\ncourt in New York on Aug. 4, 2013, saying Fullscreen was using\nmusic videos without obtaining licenses or paying royalties.  Fullscreen is a multichannel network that operates and\naggregates thousands of YouTube channels, with content that is\ncomprised mainly of cover song videos, according to the\ncomplaint.  Founded by former YouTube manager George Strompolos,\nFullscreen claims to have 200 million subscribers across 15,000\nYouTube channels with more than 2.5 billion monthly views,\naccording to its website.

Chinese officials \u201cdesperately wanted\u201d the technical\nknow-how to manufacture white pigment cleanly, and California\nengineer Walter Liew told them he could provide it, a U.S.\nprosecutor told jurors.  Except Liew didn\u2019t have the knowledge, the prosecutor said.\nSo he stole it from DuPont Co., the world\u2019s largest producer of\nthe pigment, and gave it to a Chinese state-owned company for\n$28 million in contracts, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Hemann\nsaid this week in San Francisco, where Liew is on trial, accused\nof conspiracy, economic espionage and trade secret theft.  \u201cHe didn\u2019t have the ability,\u201d Hemann said in opening\nstatements in federal court. \u201cIt had to be taken. This case is\nabout theft.\u201d  Liew, a poor Malaysian farmer\u2019s son who emigrated to the\nU.S. in 1980, and co-defendant Robert Maegerle, a 78-year-old\nex-DuPont engineer, say trade secrets played no role in the\nplans they delivered to help a Chinese company in the $14\nbillion global market for white pigment.  Rather, they took publicly available information developed\nin the 1960s and technology that wasn\u2019t protected by\nconfidentiality agreements, and over several years came up with\ntheir own design to cleanly manufacture titanium dioxide, a\nwhite chemical substance used paper, paint and plastics, their\nlawyers said.  \u201cWe are talking about some old stuff,\u201d Stuart Gasner,\nLiew\u2019s attorney, told the jury. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of trade\nsecrets\u2019 being used.\u201d  China\u2019s Pangang Group Inc. paid Liew $28 million from 2006\nto 2011 for contracts to design a titanium plant that used\nchloride, instead of the more toxic sulphate, to make titanium\ndioxide, Hemann said. The men had process-flow diagrams and\nparts of an internal report from Wilmington, Delaware-based\nDuPont, the biggest U.S. chemical maker, about the specialized\nvats needed for such a plant, both trade secrets, he said.  Pangang was also charged in the case. U.S. District Judge\nJeffrey White is weighing dismissal of the indictment because\nprosecutors failed to get the charging documents to the company.

Since the inception of the currency, more than 35 major Bitcoin scams and thefts have occurred worldwide, including the heist of 38,527 Bitcoins from online-exchange Bitcoinica LLC in May 2012, according to BitcoinTalk.org. About a dozen startups, from a coin-making company called Titan Mint Inc. to a marketplace called BitShares that lets people trade Bitcoins among themselves, are aiming to assuage concerns over Bitcoin\u2019s vulnerability. They\u2019re offering everything from metal coins embossed with security codes to encrypted online accounts. \u201cThe risk is there, and that is enough to dissuade some users,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist for ConvergEx Group in New York. He estimates that more Bitcoins are lost to thieves and hackers today than dollars to bank robberies. Since Bitcoins are stored as software files in \u201cwallets,\u201d or folders on websites, personal computers or smartphones, that makes them susceptible to loss to theft, failure or hacking. And because the digital money was designed to be difficult to trace, any looting is akin to a cash plunder, and harder to track compared with real money held in bank accounts. The skyrocketing value of Bitcoins, to more than $1,000 in November from about $12 in early 2013, has made them a more tempting target and worth extra protection efforts. Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped about 7 percent on exchange Bitstamp today after a major Tokyo-based exchange, Mt. Gox, said in a blog post it imposed a \u201ctemporary pause on all withdrawal requests.\u201d Out of about 1 million people with Bitcoin wallets, as many as a few thousand have lost their funds, according to Andreas Antonopoulos, a Bitcoin security analyst. The scope of theft is difficult to measure, since Bitcoins were designed to be a hard-to-trace self-governing currency. Created in 2008 by an unknown programmer or group of programmers, the supply of Bitcoin is regulated by the software underlying the currency, which can only be created by solving complex puzzles embedded in Bitcoin\u2019s code. The digital money is being used to buy everything from chocolates to digital cameras on the Web. Michail Wilson, a 42-year-old systems administrator in Seattle, turned to physical coins from Titan Mint. Each coin -- which will be available in gold or silver -- contains a redemption code to unlock Bitcoins. \u201cI like the idea of being able to hold something,\u201d said Wilson, who said he bought 230 Titan coins and later sold half of them to other people. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about it being hacked. I can just throw them in a safe and not worry about my wallet being hacked.\u201d Once Bitcoins are stolen, it may be impossible to get them back, since a transfer is similar to a cash transaction, rather than a reversible exchange between accounts. Bitcoin wallets also aren\u2019t protected, such as through deposit insurance offered by governments. Financial tools that safeguard money -- such as escrows and safes -- are also being developed for Bitcoins. Of the nine companies funded by Adam Draper\u2019s Boost, six have a strong focus on security, he said. \u201cHaving people think their money is safe is the most important aspect for Bitcoin mass adoption,\u201d Draper wrote in an e-mail. Scott Robinson runs Bitcoin Accelerator Program, a startup incubator in Sunnyvale, California. He said he\u2019s received more than 45 applications from startups. Of those, about 40 percent were focused on security or digital wallets, he said. \u201cIn Bitcoin, there\u2019s no central authority that\u2019s monitoring the risk points of account access, as in banking,\u201d said Richard Crone, CEO of payment-consultancy Crone Consulting LLC. \u201cThere\u2019s no oversight. There\u2019s no way of estimating what percentage of people using Bitcoin have lost money due to hacks, viruses and thefts -- which should have everyone question the viability, given these vulnerabilities.\u201d Some developers of new Bitcoin-security technologies have background in cryptography and military security. Alan Reiner -- CEO of Armory Technologies Inc., the maker of secured Bitcoin wallet Bitcoin Armory, which has been downloaded 65,000 times in the last six months -- used to work on missile defense at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Ian Purton, developer of StrongCoin.com, learned about Bitcoin while designing software for investment banks. Dan Larimer, who is building a more secure currency exchange, had worked on autonomous vehicles. \u201cWe have security problems, but we also have security opportunities,\u201d Antonopoulos, the security analyst, said in an interview. \u201cWe can innovate with money.\u201d To reduce the risk of currency-exchange website owners stealing users\u2019 money, Larimer and his team of more than 15 full-time employees are building BitShares, a Bitcoin exchange where the participants jointly run and manage the operation. While users usually have to trust their money and data to a private company to buy and sell Bitcoins, the members of BitShares also double as safekeepers. Since the technology will be distributed as bits of software across members\u2019 computers, no single person will have access to all of the money or the central system. \u201cNo company can run away with your funds, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that,\u201d Larimer said. \u201cThere\u2019s no central place to rob.\u201d His exchange is on track to debut this year, he said. Another method to prevent theft is \u201ccold storage,\u201d or offline Bitcoins. Antonopoulos has created the Safe Paper Wallet project, which sells kits that let users print their log-in credentials on a piece of paper, which can then be kept in a safe-deposit box. \u201cI keep 99.9 percent of my Bitcoins in my paper wallet,\u201d Antonopoulos said. \u201cYou don\u2019t walk around with your net worth in your purse.\u201d Czech startup SatoshiLabs is releasing a device with a small screen and two buttons that must be used to initiate Bitcoin transactions. Money can\u2019t be moved without the device, making it more difficult for hackers to steal Bitcoins. Another popular security method is to store Bitcoin passwords as well as the actual digital money as digital codes etched on coins and other metal objects such as a plaque, to make sure they won\u2019t be lost in a fire or obliterated by spilled coffee. Bitcoin Firesafe, a startup in Memphis, Tennessee, in November began selling fireproof metal pieces that contain Bitcoin wallet owners\u2019 private passwords. That allows users to remove login information from a computer, so it can\u2019t be found by a virus or a hacker. For Titan coins, each is registered to an e-mail address and password, which are needed to redeem the Bitcoin value stored within. To spend the coins, users peel back a security hologram to uncover a unique redemption code. Tim Fillmore, president of Titan, said the company has sold more than 1,000 coins since they went on sale in September. \u201cThey are really designed to appeal to coin collectors and traditional gold buyers,\u201d Fillmore said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-07/bitcoin-rally-spawns-startups-offering-theft-protection-tech', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 7, 17, 27, 1, 626000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Rally Spawns Startups Offering Theft Protection: Tech'}, {'articleText': u'  Robocoin Technologies, the company that opened the world\u2019s first Bitcoin automated teller machine, won\u2019t need regulatory approval from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to provide the machines in the Chinese city.

Bitcoin is not a currency but a virtual commodity.\u201d Robocoin opened the first Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver in October, allowing users to exchange cash for Bitcoins or vice versa, according to the company\u2019s website. Zynga Inc. became the latest merchant to accept Bitcoins, testing it as a virtual currency for some of its online games. Hong Kong\u2019s laws imposes punishment on the illegal act of theft, fraud and money laundering involving Bitcoin, the HKMA said. The regulator said Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have any backing and doesn\u2019t meet the criteria of a means of payment or an electronic currency. Taiwan\u2019s Financial Supervisory Commission won\u2019t allow Bitcoin ATMs on the island, Tseng Ming-Chung, minister at the commission, said in Taipei today.

Now he\u2019s packed his bags and moved back to Texas, convinced the best deals are gone. The 52-year-old began making venture investments in China in 2009 and ended up putting money into about 50 startups. His focus was backing students graduating from top schools, such as Tsinghua University, as they came up with innovative ideas for companies. The valuations for startups have risen so much, though, he thinks the bargains are now gone. The venture business has soared in China as investors try to imitate the success of companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which last year scored the largest initial public offering ever, and Xiaomi Corp., the smartphone maker valued at $45 billion. Venture investment in China more than tripled last year, pushing valuations to levels approaching those in the U.S. \u201cThe market changed like a switch,\u201d said Bell, who cut the deals as managing director of Trilogy VC, a venture capital firm founded with Trilogy Software Inc. chairman Joseph Liemandt. In 2014, total venture capital deals in China hit $13.6 billion, up from $4.2 billion the year before, according to the London-based consultancy Preqin Ltd. Venture capital investments in the U.S. rose to $54 billion from $36 billion. Bell, an entrepreneur who has started companies on three continents, began going to China regularly when he sold software for Trilogy, based in Raleigh, North Carolina. He and Liemandt decided to begin their venture investing in China in large part because valuations were so much lower than for U.S. companies. Bell would visit schools including Tsinghua and Peking University in Beijing and host competitions in which students voted on each other\u2019s 60-second elevator pitches. The best business idea would win 3,000 yuan ($483). He found plenty of opportunities for so-called angel investing, usually the first outside money put into a startup. He said he could offer $100,000 for a 25 percent stake, roughly one-sixth the cost of similar Silicon Valley seed deals. \u201cEvery term sheet I put out, I got the deal,\u201d Bell said. His portfolio grew to include BTCChina.com, China\u2019s most popular bitcoin exchange; games maker droidhen.com; social sharing app JiaThis.com; and sports motion sensor Zepp Labs. Last year, as Alibaba went public, the number of angel investors in China soared to thousands from a few dozen two years before. A Chinese version of AngelList, vc.cn, tallies at least 1,985 investors. Bell said local competitors started offering money at 10 times the valuations he was used to, putting them in the same range as Silicon Valley startups that had more support and less country risk. \u201cAs a startup investor, if I\u2019m paying seven times or less than my U.S. counterparts, I\u2019m going to be okay,\u201d Bell said. \u201cBut once I start paying the same? I\u2019m like, no way.\u201d China seed and startup tech investments rose to $2 billion in 2014 from $946 million in 2013, according to Hong Kong-based AVCJ Research. So far this year, it has hit $1.4 billion. Bell isn\u2019t the only one with concerns about valuations. \u201cAngel investing is almost on par with the U.S.,\u201d said Rui Ma, partner for 500 Startups, a Silicon Valley-based fund. \u201cThey have the same prices as the U.S. but less traction, the companies are less mature.\u201d That's a boon for entrepreneurs like Deng Jin, a journalist who decided to launch an online education company to fill what she felt were gaps in her daughter\u2019s traditional elementary school. Even without a clear idea how she\u2019d make money, she raised $2 million to start providing online and mobile courses in liberal arts. \u201cWhen you look back in China\u2019s history there has not been a better time than now for startups and entrepreneurs,\u201d she said. Still, many early stage investors may not see the risks that Bell did. Seed investing in China has a very short track record and few have realized the high rate of failure. In Silicon Valley, it\u2019s common to have only one big hit out of 10 investments. \u201cWhen people are doing things they\u2019ve never done before, there\u2019s a learning curve,\u201d said William Bao Bean, investment partner at SOSventures and managing director of Chinaccelerator in Shanghai.", 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-20/why-one-venture-investor-called-it-quits-amid-china-startup-boom', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 5, 20, 21, 0, 2, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"This American VC Thinks He's Getting Out of China Just in Time"}, {'articleText': u' Bitcoin got a boost at the European Union\u2019s top court after judges said exchanging virtual currencies should be exempt from value-added tax in the same way as traditional cash. In a ruling that puts Bitcoin on a more equal footing with mainstream money, the EU Court of Justice sided with Swede David Hedqvist who set up a service for the exchange of mainstream money for bitcoin and vice versa. VAT, a type of sales tax, shouldn\u2019t be charged because the business involves \u201cthe exchange of different means of payment,\u201d the judges said. \u201cIt\u2019s very good news,\u201d\xa0said Simon Dixon, CEO of Bnktothefuture.com, a platform for investing in new, alternative financial products, including those based on Bitcoins. \u201cIf you were taxed on the exchange it would make it an inferior currency to other currencies, so the implications of it being treated as a currency are that it can free flow.\u201d Bitcoin currency, introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, has no central issuing authority and uses a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions. It has gained traction with merchants selling legitimate products but also has been used to facilitate illegal transactions because money can be transferred anonymously. Virtual currencies have faced increased scrutiny amid concern that their use may fall under the radar of financial watchdogs and law-enforcement. The European Banking Authority said last year that banks shouldn\u2019t buy, hold or sell virtual currencies until regulators develop safeguards to protect their integrity. \u201cI always felt like this was the only sensible decision,\u201d\xa0Hedqvist said after the ruling. \u201cIt is important for businesses all over Europe that they finally have clear guidance regarding VAT and for some this could mean that they will get money back from the tax office.\u201d The lack of clarification from the EU on how bitcoin should be treated for tax purposes has been \u201ca bit of a hindrance,\u201d said Dixon. Bitcoin\xa0has \u201cproperties of a commodity, some of the properties of a currency and it\u2019s also a technology,\u201d he said by phone from London. The EU court said to exclude bitcoin exchanges from the tax exemptions given to traditional exchanges \u201cwould deprive it of part of its effects,\u201d given that the exemption\u2019s aim is to counter \u201cthe difficulties connected with determining the taxable amount and the amount of VAT deductible\u201d in cases of taxation of financial transactions.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/StephanieBodoni', 'name': u'Stephanie Bodoni', 'twitterhandle': u'StephanieBodoni'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/bitcoin-virtual-currency-exchange-is-tax-free-eu-court-says-ig21wzcd', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 22, 9, 53, 37, 610000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"EU's Top Court Rules That Bitcoin Exchange Is Tax-Free"}, {'articleText': u'  Jesse Powell knew Mt. Gox was not long for this world more than two years before the once-dominant bitcoin exchange went bankrupt in February. In June 2011, Powell took a last-minute flight to Tokyo to help Mt. Gox recover from a hacking attack. He ran the day-to-day business, drafting press releases, hiring and training staff, while the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles focused on reviving the service. A month after the trip, Powell founded a competitor -- Kraken. It is in talks to offer services in Japan, he said in an interview, declining to give a date. \u201cIt was clear after that hack at Mt. Gox, when they were down for like a week, that the exchange is really the most critical piece of the ecosystem,\u201d said Powell, 33, who started dealing with digital currencies more than a decade ago when he set up an online store for virtual swords and armor. \u201cI wanted there to be another one to take its place, if Mt. Gox failed.\u201d When a $470 million heist finally shuttered Mt. Gox for good in February, San Francisco-based Kraken\u2019s user base surged 50 percent in two months, making it one of the top bitcoin exchanges. The company accounts for about half of the virtual currency\u2019s daily euro trading, Powell said in a telephone interview on July 29. Powell is already an industry veteran. In 2001 he founded Lewt, an equivalent of Amazon.com for the virtual potions, runes and amulets used in some computer games -- seven years before bitcoin came into existence. When he dropped out of California State University, Sacramento, in 2003 to run the company full time, the business environment was similar to that facing bitcoin entrepreneurs now, he says. So-called real money trading, or sale of in-game items, currency and characters, has been banned by many companies that run massive online multiplayer games. Square Enix Holdings Co. set up a special task force to punish transgressors in \u201cFinal Fantasy XI,\u201d while the terms of use for Activision Blizzard Inc.\u2019s \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d explicitly forbid it. Powell says one of his acquaintances lost about $100,000 worth of virtual gold overnight after Blizzard suspended his account, leaving the man with no recourse. Even so, Lewt prospered. It tapped into a latent demand from people that slipped through the cracks of the financial system -- kids, foreigners, those with a bad credit score, he said. The business also gave Powell a nose for opportunities offered by digital currencies as well as the real money to get Kraken started. \u201cThe whole game currency space was very interesting to me, which is how I was able to notice bitcoin,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIt has all the benefits of these gaming currencies without that centralized point of weakness. I think it\u2019s really the future.\u201d Regulatory hurdles and uncertainty still make opening new markets difficult for bitcoin businesses, Powell said. That\u2019s why he was back in Japan in May, rubbing shoulders with local legislators and laying the groundwork for the new service. Kraken is one of the founding members of Japan Authority of Digital Asset, together with CoinPass and BitFlyer. A picture posted on the web shows Powell, with long blond hair, in a T-shirt and a down vest, posing for a photo with black-suited Liberal Democratic Party parliamentarian Mineyuki Fukuda. Another photo shows Fukuda squatting next to a homemade bitcoin mining rig. \u201cI was really surprised how open-minded Japanese politicians are,\u201d Powell said. \u201cCompared to Japan, the United States is in the Dark Ages.\u201d The start of Kraken\u2019s services was set back by half a year when the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued guidance on virtual currencies in March 2013, Powell said. The rules made it difficult to get custodial bank accounts to hold customer funds, limiting the company\u2019s U.S. services to five states -- South Carolina, Montana, Alabama, New Mexico and Massachusetts, he said. Kraken got a break when it partnered with Germany\u2019s Fidor Bank AG in October. Euro trading of virtual currencies, including bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin, accounts for about 95 percent of the company\u2019s volume, Powell said. The exchange also allows deposits and withdrawals in South Korean won. \u201cMost of our launches into a new region depend on getting a banking partner there,\u201d Powell said, declining to name the Japanese counterpart. \u201cIt\u2019s a big expense opening a new region. Whoever goes in first will do all the hard work.\u201d Competition for a slice of Japan\u2019s virtual currency market is intensifying as new entrants seek to take advantage of the vacuum left by Mt. Gox. BitFlyer began offering services in April. BitOcean, a Chinese startup, joined with New York-based Atlas ATS Inc. to bid for the assets of the defunct Mt. Gox. The two companies plan to start a bitcoin platform in the country this month, according to Nan Xiaoning, founder and chief executive officer of BitOcean. Bitcoin fetched about $494 in Tokyo today, down from a record $1,151 in December, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.

Cornelis Jan Slomp, 23, of Woerden, Netherlands, was the biggest drug dealer on Silk Road, prosecutor Andrew Boutros said at a hearing today in federal court in Chicago. Slomp admitted to one count of drug trafficking conspiracy and his lawyer said he may be asked to testify against the alleged mastermind of Silk Road, who went by the name \u201cDread Pirate Roberts.\u201d Described as a \u201csprawling black-market bazaar\u201d by U.S. prosecutors in New York, who said it was used to anonymously sell illicit goods and launder money, the Silk Road site was shut last year. Slomp, a software developer, made more than $3 million from March 2012 until he was arrested in August 2013, according to a plea agreement accepted today by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly. While the maximum punishment for Slomp\u2019s crime is 40 years in prison and a $5 million fine, prosecutors agreed to seek a term of no more than 15 years as long as Slomp cooperates with the government\u2019s continuing investigation. Ross William Ulbricht, who allegedly ran Silk Road as Dread Pirate Roberts, has pleaded not guilty to charges of running a narcotics-trafficking scheme, money laundering, computer hacking and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. His trial is scheduled for Nov. 3. While Slomp never met Ulbricht, the two have communicated, defense lawyer Paul Petruzzi of Miami said after today\u2019s hearing. \u201cThey chatted,\u201d Petruzzi said. Slomp was arrested in August at the Miami International Airport on his way to a meeting with alleged co-conspirators where he planned to \u201cspin off his entire U.S. Silk Road operations\u201d to one of them, prosecutors said last month. Before the U.S. seized his assets, Slomp had been a depositor in the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox Co. bitcoin exchange, Petruzzi said. The exchange filed for bankruptcy in February. Mt. Gox creditors today won a U.S. judge\u2019s tentative approval of a plan to settle a misappropriation lawsuit with two of the bitcoin exchange\u2019s executives, while maintaining litigation against Mt. Gox principal Mark Karpeles and Japan\u2019s Mizuho Bank Ltd. Mt. Gox said when it sought bankruptcy protection that it couldn\u2019t account for more than 850,000 bitcoins, which were then worth about $500 million. It later said 200,000 had been located. The creditors, who sued the exchange\u2019s U.S. affiliate, Karpeles and the executives with whom they\u2019ve settled, propose to partner with outside investors to revive the exchange and compensate depositors. That deal also must be approved by a Japanese bankruptcy court. One bitcoin was worth $436.99 at 2:15 p.m. New York time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. The criminal case is U.S. v.

Nothing in the annals of corporate hacking compares to the portrait U.S. authorities painted Tuesday of a vast, global crime syndicate -- a mob for the digital age. As described by federal prosecutors, it was an operation of breathtaking scale, involving more than 100 people in a dozen countries, with illicit proceeds stretching into the hundreds of millions of dollars. At its head is a mysterious Israeli, Gery Shalon -- a 31-year-old from the Republic of Georgia who prosecutors said used aliases, fake passports and banking havens to turn hacking into the backbone of his criminal enterprise. Much as the mafia gained footholds in construction, shipping, trucking and gambling, Shalon\u2019s organization was a conglomerate that allegedly ran illegal Internet casinos and elaborate pump-and-dump stock schemes, while dabbling in credit-card fraud and fake pharmaceuticals. His group is the thread that runs through many of the biggest cyber-attacks of recent years, including the largest bank breach on record, involving the theft of information relating to 83 million customer accounts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Along with JPMorgan,\xa0Fidelity Investments Ltd., E*Trade Financial Corp., Scottrade Financial Services Inc. and Dow Jones & Co., a unit of News Corp., confirmed they had been among the victims of hackers who worked for the group. The indictment unsealed Tuesday against Shalon and two other men didn\u2019t name those institutions, saying only that hackers linked with the group had breached banks and other financial firms, stealing information on 100 million of their customers. \u201cThe conduct alleged in this case showcases the brave new world of hacking for profit,\u201d U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said Tuesday in announcing two of the indictments that laid out parts of the scheme. \u201cIt is no longer hacking merely for a quick payout,\u201d Bharara said. \u201cIt is hacking as a business model.\u201d The allegations are perhaps the starkest illustration yet that even the most sophisticated computer networks, run by companies at the heart of the global financial system, may be vulnerable in the age of the Digital Don. The latest revelations come just three months after U.S. authorities arrested several men they accuse of lurking inside servers where corporate press announcements were awaiting release, in order to trade on the information before it went public. Shalon\u2019s alleged ring processed payment information for fake pharmaceuticals and fake anti-virus software. Its members sent misleading stock pitches to clients of banks and brokerages, whose e-mail addresses they\u2019d stolen. They profited by using trading accounts set up under fake names and used dozens of shell companies and bank and brokerage accounts around the world to launder money. They also tried to extract nonpublic information from financial corporations, prosecutors said. Shalon -- also known as Garri Shalelashvili, Phillipe Mousset and Christopher Engeham -- was the self-described \u201cfounder\u201d of the enterprise, according to an indictment unsealed in Manhattan that also named Joshua Aaron and Ziv Orenstein. Shalon\xa0directed hacks to further his market-manipulation and Internet gambling schemes,\xa0the indictment said, concealing at least $100 million in Swiss and other bank accounts. Shalon and Orenstein were arrested in Israel in July,\xa0and the U.S. is seeking their extradition to New York for trial. Aaron remains at large. Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Orenstein, didn\u2019t immediately return a voice-mail message left at his office seeking comment. Shalon and Aaron couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. A separate indictment outlined the case against Anthony Murgio, who was arrested in Florida in July. He was accused of crimes related to a bitcoin-exchange service owned by Shalon, as well as the takeover of a New Jersey credit union, all used to launder proceeds from the criminal enterprise. Gregory Kehoe, a lawyer for Murgio, didn\u2019t immediately return a voicemail message left at his office seeking comment. Outlines of the government\u2019s case against the men began emerging with the arrests last summer, when Shalon, Orenstein and Aaron were implicated in a pump-and-dump scheme. That began raising questions about the links between Shalon and a group of men, including Murgio and Aaron, whose friendship dated back more than a decade to their days at Florida State University. Another mystery: Who did the hacking? A clue emerged in an indictment over the E*Trade attack, which was unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Atlanta. It names Shalon, Aaron and a third person -- \u201ca computer hacker who is believed to have resided in Russia\u201d -- who it alleges infiltrated computer networks under Shalon\u2019s direction, located customer databases and exported the profile information to computers overseas. Among the ring\u2019s early hacking targets was Dow Jones. The hackers located some 10 million e-mail addresses of customers and stole millions of those from Dow Jones, identified as Victim 8 in the indictment. In October, the company disclosed that its computer systems had been hacked. As part of that disclosure, Dow Jones chief executive officer William Lewis said that some customer payment information may have been compromised -- on no more than 3,500 accounts -- and that it was unknown whether other information had been taken. Earlier in October, Scottrade disclosed that it had been hacked and that information on 4.6 million customers had been taken. According to the indictment, Shalon and a co-conspirator expanded their efforts to seek material non-public information from firms they were hacking. In one e-mail, they referred to seeking \u201cinteresting info\u201d from top managers at Victim 5, a St. Louis brokerage firm now confirmed as Scottrade. A spokeswoman for Dow Jones said in a statement: "The indictment unsealed today refers to the public disclosure we made on October 9. The government\u2019s investigation is ongoing, and we continue to cooperate with law enforcement." The hack of Fidelity has been previously reported. The company said it has no indication that any customer accounts, customer information or related systems were affected. E*Trade confirmed it was attacked in late 2013 but declined to provide more information. \u201cWe continue to cooperate with law enforcement in fighting cybercrime,\u201d JPMorgan spokeswoman Trish Wexler said in a statement. Shalon began building his criminal conglomerate in 2007 with Internet casinos and capped it off with stock and credit-card schemes years later, according to the 68-page indictment against Shalon and others in Manhattan. Shalon and his associates operated at least a dozen online \u201creal money\u201d casinos in the U.S. from 2007 until this year, raking in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and, in some months, millions in profit. By December 2013, Shalon was paying 270 casino employees in Hungary and Ukraine, the indictment said. \u201cCasino turnover\u201d in October 2013 alone was $78.9 million, Shalon\u2019s associate Orenstein said in an e-mail. Profit for February 2015 totaled $7.29 million, another e-mail said. To attract bettors, Shalon used \u201cmassive\u201d e-mail campaigns. He also arranged to send promotional material through the regular mail to as many as 100,000 U.S. residents in more than 30 states. All the while, Shalon was bent on crippling his rivals, the government said. He and his accomplices allegedly broke into other Internet gambling operations to steal customer data and orchestrated the hack of two firms that supplied software to online casinos. By 2012, the government said, Shalon had grown so aggressive he was engineering cyber-attacks to incapacitate rival gambling sites \u201cin response to perceived misconduct\u201d directed at his own casinos. Another part of Shalon\u2019s 21st-century cyberfraud was a classic 20th-century pump-and-dump scheme, which authorities said netted tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits. Teaming with two allegedly crooked stock promoters who are now cooperating with prosecutors, Shalon, Aaron and sometimes Orenstein selected publicly traded companies or private firms they could take public through reverse mergers with listed shell corporations. Using aliases and phony passports, the five opened trading accounts and then bought on the cheap almost all of a company\u2019s shares, driving its price higher -- in one instance, more than 1,800 percent higher. In the first phase, they and their accomplices executed prearranged trades that spurred a modest price rise on successive days. Next, prosecutors wrote, Shalon and Aaron sent spam e-mails touting the stock and its price rise to millions of potential investors they\u2019d identified in their earlier hacks of banks and brokerages. Is it \u201cpopular in America -- buying stocks?\u201d an accomplice not named in the indictment asked Shalon at one point. \u201cIt\u2019s like drinking freaking vodka in Russia,\u201d Shalon answered, according to the indictment. \u201cWe buy them\u201d -- stocks -- \u201cvery cheap, perform machinations, then play with them.\u201d With the price inflated, Shalon, Aaron and the promoters began dumping their shares in coordinated fashion, often generating millions of dollars in profit per stock. Their sales eventually put downward pressure on the stock, and unsuspecting investors suffered big losses, prosecutors said. The profits, Shalon boasted, were \u201ca small step towards a larger empire.\u201d In all, Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein manipulated dozens of stocks, prosecutors said. They made more than $2 million in 2012 when they pushed up the price of Mustang Alliances Inc., a purported mining company with operations in Honduras, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit filed against the three in July. By telling investors that the company was \u201csitting on at least $1.7 billion worth of gold,\u201d the group raised the price of Mustang by 65 percent. \u201cIn a way, it was securities fraud on cybersteroids,\u201d Bharara said. There was more than a fair amount of ingenuity involved. Criminals seeking to accept payments by credit and debit cards face a big problem -- how to steer money through a global financial system where card networks, banks and regulators doggedly prowl for suspicious transactions. Prosecutors said Shalon and conspirators offered a solution. They allegedly set up a sophisticated processing system that funneled hundreds of millions of dollars for criminals while charging a fee for each transaction -- more than $18 million total. Tactics described in the indictment ranged from old-fashioned bribery to other strategies requiring more creativity. First, Shalon set up a bogus pet-supply store and dress shop. Then, every time a card was used by a U.S. gambler, he and his accomplices made it look like payments went to fake stores selling pet supplies and wedding dresses. When card networks caught the ring\u2019s illegal payments, they imposed millions of dollars in penalties on banks that let transactions slip through. Shalon and his accomplices allegedly feigned shock, reimbursed the banks, then set up more accounts, according to prosecutors. When all else failed, they hacked the watchdogs. Shalon\u2019s alleged victims included a risk-intelligence firm in Bellevue, Washington, that flagged merchants accepting payments for \u201cunlawful goods or services," according to the indictment. Prosecutors said the defendants hacked into the company\u2019s computer network to read e-mails and keep tabs on its efforts. The hackers figured out which credit and debit cards the company used to detect bogus merchants, then blacklisted those card numbers from Shalon\u2019s network. With hundreds of millions rolling in from their global enterprise, the gang needed a way to process and launder its cash, prosecutors said. Shalon, Orenstein and others used Shalon\u2019s bitcoin-exchange company, Coin.mx, to process transactions and hide their origins, while charging fees on each deal. Murgio, the ex-Florida State University student arrested over the summer, operated Coin.mx. The group set up a front company, Collectibles Club \u2013- supposedly a platform for hobbyists to chat and sell treasures like stamps and sports memorabilia \u2013-\xa0 to disguise the unlicensed money-transmitting business. They then took over the New Jersey credit union -- with Murgio allegedly paying over $200,000 to two accounts at the direction of an unidentified bank executive between May and December 2014 -- and installing accomplices on the board of directors. They then moved Coin.mx\u2019s banking operations there, making it \u201ca captive bank for their unlawful business,\u201d the U.S. said. The money-laundering operation was as complex as other parts of the vast scheme. Using phony documents and aliases, the ring used accounts and at least 75 shell companies to wash its proceeds and moved gambling proceeds from account to account to account. \u201cThey colluded with corrupt international bank officials who willfully ignored its criminal nature in order to profit from, as a co-conspirator described it to Shalon, their payment processing \u2018casino/software/pharmaceutical cocktail\u2019,\u201d according to the indictment of the three. The outfit may have had grander ambitions -- stealing inside information about companies to win a leg up in the market -- Bharara said Tuesday. \u201cThe conduct alleged in this case also may signal next frontier in securities fraud, sophisticated hacking to steal material non-public information,\u201d he said. The defendants discussed this \u201cas the next stage of their sprawling criminal enterprise.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/gregfarrel', 'name': u'Greg Farrell', 'twitterhandle': u'gregfarrel'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/digital-don-accused-of-hacks-at-jpmorgan-dow-jones-over-8-years', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 10, 22, 8, 34, 821000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'The Man Accused of Masterminding the Hacks That Shook Wall Street'}, {'articleText': u'  New York\u2019s financial regulator said the state this year will be the first to propose regulations for oversight of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. \u201cSerious people -\u2013 in the technological and investment community -\u2013 are taking virtual currencies seriously,\u201d Benjamin Lawsky, the state\u2019s superintendent of financial services, said at a hearing in New York today. \u201cThey are putting significant amounts of time, attention, and capital behind them. We, as a regulator, cannot turn a blind eye.\u201d Federal regulators in March said Bitcoin-related businesses can be handled as state-licensed money transmitters, triggering a race by some states to assess their own rules. Bitcoin, a software protocol for issuing and moving money across the Internet, has gained traction with merchants selling everything from Sacramento Kings basketball tickets to kitchen mixers on Overstock.com. Venture capitalists see it as an alternative to the global payment system currently dominated by companies including Visa, Western Union and large banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. Other states, notably California, are also studying how they will treat Bitcoin-related businesses, and may do so under existing rules. Lawsky convened two days of hearings to consider whether New York should create what he called a \u201cBitLicense\u201d for virtual currency companies. The price of Bitcoin rose almost 4.5 percent today to $851.10 at 2:30 p.m. New York time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. In an interview, Lawsky said the complexity of the emerging virtual currency business suggests his department needs to do more than simply adjust New York\u2019s existing rules on money transmitters. \u201cIt\u2019s feeling more like little tweaks around the edges are not enough,\u201d Lawsky said. The idea got a skeptical reception from industry participants at the hearing, who debated with Lawsky whether regulation, especially rules aimed at stopping money laundering, could stifle innovation. \u201cIt is difficult to determine the problems the BitLicense idea is meant to  solve, or how well it would solve them,\u201d Marco Santori, chairman of the regulatory affairs committee of the Bitcoin Foundation, a group promoting the currency, said in written testimony for the hearing. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, brothers who are seeking regulatory approval for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, pointed out that federal regulators have said their legal tools are enough. \u201cWe agree,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cWe also believe the same is true of state law.\u201d Fred Wilson, managing partner of Union Square Ventures, a New York venture capital firm, said at the hearing that existing rules on money laundering and consumer protection \u201care probably the right kind of regulations.\u201d \u201cWe should not regulate how the system itself operates,\u201d Wilson said. At the same time, Wilson also suggested that New York might adopt a simplified rule in which companies notify the regulator they are operating, and are in a legal \u201csafe harbor\u201d for a certain period of time. Lawsky\u2019s general counsel, Daniel Alter, countered that \u201csimply knowing somebody is operating\u201d isn\u2019t enough for regulators. \u201cIt would be great for any industry if you could simply open the doors,\u201d Alter said. Jeremy Liew, a partner with Menlo Park, California-based Lightspeed Ventures, argued that the current system has so far worked well to stop illicit use of Bitcoin, and that new rules could push startups away \u201cIf that same company can be started in the U.K. or Germany, maybe that innovation just gets pushed offshore,\u201d Liew said. Lawsky, speaking near the rebuilt World Trade Center in New York, said that regulators have to focus on how to prevent crimes like the ones on Sept. 11, 2001, not simply investigating after the fact. \u201cThe first job is to get rid of money laundering,\u201d he said. The hearings come one day after a federal indictment of the head of a digital currency exchange, Charlie Shrem, on charges of conspiring to launder more than $1 million in Bitcoin tied to Silk Road, an online bazaar alleged to have hosted the sale of illicit goods. Shrem, the chief executive officer of BitInstant, resigned today as vice chairman of  Bitcoin Foundation, the organization said in a blog post. The day before Lawsky and industry participants wrestled with the role of regulation, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the probe of Silk Road is \u201congoing,\u201d and warned against cutting regulatory corners. \u201cIf you want to develop a virtual currency or a virtual currency exchange business, knock yourself out,\u201d Bharara said. \u201cBut you have to follow the rules. All of them. And if you want to invest in such a business, you better kick the tires and make sure compliance there is not a joke.\u201d Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

Federal prosecutors want to present evidence at Ulbricht\u2019s drug-trafficking trial next month of alleged murder-for-hire plots, as proof of the extreme steps he took to protect an online drug-distribution network. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest today said the government may do so, even though Ulbricht isn\u2019t accused in the case of attempted murder. \u201cThe fact that there aren\u2019t any bodies doesn\u2019t erase the desire to take extremely harsh action\u201d against those who threatened Silk Road, Forrest said at a hearing in Manhattan today, rejecting a defense claim the evidence is \u201cirrelevant.\u201d Ulbricht, an Eagle Scout who earned an advanced degree in physics from Pennsylvania State University before abandoning academia to pursue a career in finance, is accused of operating an Internet marketplace where customers used the digital currency bitcoin to buy and sell drugs. He faces drug-trafficking, computer-hacking and money-laundering conspiracy charges. In other rulings, Forrest said prosecutors may present evidence that Ulbricht possessed phony identity documents but can\u2019t offer proof that Silk Road was used to sell weapons and counterfeit goods. Forrest also said she was \u201ctroubled\u201d by conspiracy allegations that appeared \u201cextraordinarily broad.\u201d She didn\u2019t issue any rulings on that matter. Prosecutors say illegal drugs were openly advertised on Silk Road under categories such as cannabis, ecstasy, opioids, prescription drugs and stimulants. Law enforcement agents made more than 100 undercover purchases of heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and LSD, prosecutors said. Ulbricht is charged with a murder-for-hire scheme in a separate case in federal court in Baltimore. Ulbricht hasn\u2019t entered a plea in that case, according to court records. The criminal case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 14-cr-00068, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The murder-for-hire case is U.S. v.

Even amid a slowing economy, the country\u2019s online shopping increased 26 percent\xa0last year, to 510 billion rubles (about $14 billion), according to Moscow\u2019s Data Insight, and could double by 2015. That has made the country an intriguing target for foreign players such as Amazon.com, EBay, Asos, and China\u2019s Alibaba Group, while boosting the fortunes of such local companies as search engine Yandex and Amazon-like Ozon. The dark horse leading the race right now is Ulmart, an online retailer that reported $1.2 billion in sales last year. It has succeeded by doing what Amazon does not. Instead of wooing customers with low-cost home delivery, Ulmart encourages them to pick up their orders at urban outposts and warehouses that double as stores. While Amazon ships on such partners as United Parcel Service, Ulmart keeps its own fleet of 190 trucks. The St. Petersburg company ships fast-moving items in bulk from suppliers to urban outlets instead of breaking apart the shipment and repackaging it at a mega-hub. Where Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos racked up $3 billion of losses in his early years, Ulmart\u2019s chairman and major shareholder, Dmitry Kostygin, says his site has lost around $30 million in its first five years. \u201cIt\u2019s in the \u2018illions,\u2019 but with an m,\u201d he laughs. And yet Ulmart\u2019s three-tier distribution and fleet allow it to bypass Russia\u2019s byzantine postal service, turn around orders in as little as seven minutes, and accept cash in a country where many are reluctant to use credit cards. While Amazon has expanded deliveries and may be testing the waters in Russia, Kostygin says he\u2019s not worried. \u201cIn this market,\u201d he says. \u201cAmazon has no chance.\u201d That prognosis may prove to be premature in a country where e-commerce makes up less than 2 percent of retail sales. But it points to the strength of the hybrid model that Ulmart\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Sergey Fedorinov, has built with Ulmart Outposts and Kibermarket stores. It also illustrates the intensity around Russia\u2019s e-commerce business right now. Kostygin and Fedorinov were together in New York yesterday to promote the company to journalists. That follows an unusual press release earlier this month in which Ulmart announced it was shelving plans to become the \u201cfirst major retailer in all of Europe\u201d to accept Bitcoin as payment after the Bank of Russia warned that could promote illegal activities, such as money laundering or the financing of terrorism. Ulmart\u2019s push comes at a time when Ozon CEO Maelle Gavett has also raised her public profile and Russia\u2019s government is making it tougher for locals to buy goods at foreign sites. Ulmart chairman Kostygin knows firsthand the power that foreign rivals wield when it comes to having capital and known brands. As chairman of the hypermarket chain Lenta, Kostygin tussled with TPG Capital when it took a controlling interest, though in yesterday\u2019s interview he cited the U.S. private equity giant\u2019s stake as a sign of Russia\u2019s openness to foreign players. (Lenta is expected to raise at least $1 billion in its initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange.) On one level, Ulmart\u2019s formula is simple. Its product mix focuses largely on electronics, and its network sticks to the cities of \u201cEuropean\u201d Russia, an area, about three times the size of Texas, where much of the country\u2019s wealth and consumption are concentrated. Ulmart currently has three national hubs that average 12,000 square meters, or roughly 129,000 square feet, with plans to build two hubs almost twice that large this year. (Many of Amazon\u2019s 100 fulfillment centers worldwide exceed 1 million square feet.) Customers can pick up or order goods at 30 urban warehouses, each of which range from 2,000 to 3,000 square meters. They can also have their orders sent to one of 250 outposts that are only 100 square meters or pay extra to get home delivery a day or two later on one of Ulmart\u2019s 190 trucks. Those living in other parts of the country are subject to the vagaries of Russian Post, a system so sclerotic that Kostygin says it can take two weeks just to cover the 400 miles between Moscow and St. Petersburg.   Unlike Fedorinov, Ozon CEO Maelle Gavet has tried to build her business across Russia\u2019s nine time zones, which increases delivery costs. For years, those advantages were muted by a generous duty-free policy that let consumers order up to 1,000 euros at a time on foreign sites and have them shipped tax free. That has now changed, with lower limits and new customs rules that prompted FedEx and DHL to suspend deliveries in January, resuming only after officials promised to simplify the process. Kostygin, for one, supports the tougher policy, saying \u201cwe\u2019ve had considerable abuse of these rules, mostly by entrepreneurs who arrange shipments for their corporations without customs clearance.\u201d While smart distribution has helped make Ulmart a leading player online, Russian e-commerce is still at an early phase. Whether a company that now gets half its sales from electronics, such as iPhones, and its \u201cMicroXperts\u201d house brand will continue to dominate as more foreign players and consumers get into the game remains to be seen.

History shows calls to supplant the currency will be futile. The dollar hasn\u2019t budged from its top spot for the past three decades, withstanding repeated efforts to unseat it. Almost 90 percent of the $5.3 trillion a day in foreign-exchange transactions last year involved the dollar, the same share as in 1989, data from the Bank for International Settlements show. More than 80 percent of trade finance was done in dollars in 2013, according to Swift, a global financial-messaging network. Companies, consumers and central banks around the world prefer the dollar to other currencies, including the euro and yen, because they trust the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government to back it, according to Marc Chandler, the chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. \u201cThere are always people who say the dollar is going to be replaced, but it hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Chandler, who\u2019s based in New York. \u201cThe biggest threat to the dollar\u2019s dominance is the U.S. deciding to abdicate one day, not others complaining about it for this reason or that.\u201d As long as the dollar maintains its central role, banks around the world will have to bow to U.S. rules and oversight. BNP Paribas SA, the French firm hit with a $9 billion fine last month, also agreed to suspend clearing dollar transactions related to oil and gas trading when it pleaded guilty to violating U.S. sanctions against transferring cash for Iranian and Sudanese entities. New rules introduced this year tightened the regulation of foreign lenders\u2019 U.S. units. A week after the BNP Paribas plea, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin urged European governments to promote the euro more in international transactions. While he said he wasn\u2019t fighting \u201cdollar imperialism,\u201d his comments echoed those of predecessor Valery Giscard D\u2019Estaing, who coined the term \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d in 1965, referring to the benefits the U.S. received for the dollar\u2019s status. When the euro was introduced in 1999, some predicted it would one day topple the dollar. Since then, the euro has only taken over the share of the European currencies it replaced in global central-bank reserves. In foreign-exchange transactions, it accounts for even less. When the U.S. warned against doing business with Iran and North Korea in 2006, many -- including a former U.S. banking regulator -- predicted a shift by Iran and other oil-exporting countries away from the dollar. That didn\u2019t happen. After the 2008 financial crisis, when the Fed expanded its balance sheet by trillions of dollars and the government\u2019s budget deficit swelled, some economists said that would devalue the dollar, making it unattractive. That didn\u2019t happen either. Currencies that have been candidates for ending the dollar\u2019s supremacy have drawbacks of their own. The euro was on the verge of a breakup as recently as a year ago. The Chinese yuan isn\u2019t freely exchangeable. Bitcoin plummeted after about $500 million-worth of the virtual currency went missing. Having the global currency of choice has bestowed some benefits on the U.S., including cheaper funding of debt. It also has brought risks and responsibilities. Those became evident during the crisis, when emergency loans by the Fed to the U.S. units of European banks peaked at about $538 billion, almost as much as U.S. firms borrowed. \u201cThe Fed is the central bank of the world,\u201d said Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at Bank of America Corp.\u2019s U.S. Trust, which oversees about $380 billion. \u201cThe rest of the world benefits from the dollar standard as well.\u201d The world needs a central currency to make trading and finance flow smoothly because it reduces transaction costs, Quinlan said. The global monetary system relied on gold until World War II. The dollar replaced the precious metal under the Bretton Woods regime after the war. It was fully convertible to gold until the U.S. broke the pact in 1971 so it could devalue its currency. Now the values of most major currencies are set by market forces, even as the dollar remains the anchor. Economist Fred Bergsten, who has called for a multicurrency monetary system, acknowledges that the dollar won\u2019t lose its dominance even as others gain significance. \u201cThe dollar\u2019s role will decline gradually and modestly over time, but it will still remain as the dominant currency,\u201d said Bergsten,\xa0founder of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and a former Treasury Department official. \u201cThe euro has already claimed a central role, and the yuan keeps getting more important. Neither will likely replace the dollar, though.\u201d Last year, about 60 percent of foreign-currency reserves of the world\u2019s central banks were in dollars, little changed from 1995, according to the International Monetary Fund. That\u2019s because U.S. government bonds are seen as the safest investment. Euros make up about 25 percent. More than 60 percent of banks\u2019 cross-border liabilities are in dollars, as they were 25 years ago, compared with about 20 percent in euros, BIS data show. Governments and corporations issue most of their foreign-currency debt in dollars. In 2012, 52 percent of such borrowing was denominated in dollars, up from 43 percent in 1999, according to the most recent data available from the European Central Bank. While the euro\u2019s share has remained stable at about 25 percent, the yen now accounts for 5 percent of international debt, down from 17 percent almost two decades ago. In trade finance, the yuan quadrupled its share from a year ago to claim the No. 2 spot, Swift data show. At 9 percent, it pales in comparison with the 80 percent in dollars. \u201cThe U.S. dollar remains dominant in traditional trade finance, and we don\u2019t see a replacement any time soon,\u201d said Astrid Thorsen, the head of business-intelligence solutions at Swift in Brussels. \u201cThe yuan is gaining traction, and it has dethroned the euro from second place. But the competition has been between currencies other than the dollar.\u201d The dollar is also dominant in commodities markets. Of 1,785 active commodities-futures contracts, 1,133 are denominated in dollars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. regulators can go after foreign banks doing dollar transactions anywhere in the world because almost all are routed through two clearing networks in the U.S. Clearing of dollar transactions in Hong Kong and Singapore, though available for almost two decades, hasn\u2019t taken off. Those two cities account for less than 1 percent of the global total, BIS data show. \u201cThe Fed provides dollar liquidity, so dollar clearing will happen here,\u201d said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics Inc. in Washington, which consults for some of the world\u2019s largest banks on financial regulation. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Fed and other U.S. regulators worry about what foreign banks do. At the end, the U.S. is on the hook.\u201d The Fed\u2019s new rules for foreign banks require their U.S. units to have higher capital and liquidity. While banks might not like tighter rules or stiffer fines from U.S. regulators, they have no way out because global trade and finance will continue to require dollars, Petrou said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-15/dollar-dominance-intact-as-u-s-fines-on-banks-raise-ire', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 16, 7, 54, 24, 702000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Dollar Dominance Intact as U.S. Fines on Banks Raise Ire'}, {'articleText': u' A financial technology startup has enlisted heavyweights from Barclays Plc and Moelis & Co. as it seeks to differentiate itself in a much-hyped sector. QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain The company is called SETL, and it\u2019s seeking to overhaul the transfer of assets using the blockchain, the encrypted digital ledger that makes bitcoin work. SETL has appointed Sir David Walker, the chairman of Barclays until April this year, as its own chairman, according to a statement on Tuesday. He previously chaired Morgan Stanley International and worked as executive director at the Bank of England. SETL has also enlisted Moelis\u2019s Caroline Silver, a banker who advised on the sale of NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange, to raise funds for the company. Walker will begin his role after the company has finished raising funds. To its fans, blockchain is the future of finance -- a way to complete transactions in seconds or minutes, instead of days. It could displace creaky back-office systems, but for all its promise, blockchain has yet to be integrated into mainstream finance. Most of the companies involved have little in the way of revenue or demonstrable products. Blockchain startups and initiatives targeting capital markets have attracted about $105 million of spending so far, according to Aite Group LLC, a consultancy. Participants in the industry have used high-profile hires, partnerships with top-tier banks and money from investors to document their progress in the still nascent sector. R3, headed by former ICAP Plc executive David Rutter, has agreements with 25 of the world\u2019s largest banks. Digital Asset Holdings LLC arguably started the fever for blockchain when it hired former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker Blythe Masters as chief executive officer in March. SETL has built a functioning\xa0blockchain and demonstrated it using payments data provided by the Bank of England. The system is designed to work alongside existing infrastructure without forcing institutions to replace their current systems. Unlike the original bitcoin concept -- which relies on an anonymous, widely distributed system of computing -- SETL\u2019s ledger consists of a network of known users. \u201cWe are moving along very rapidly in terms of implementation,\u201d said SETL Chief Operating Officer Peter Randall. \u201cWe can show a functioning system. We can show a phased approach. We can show experience in innovation. Those are things which not all firms talking in this space are able to demonstrate. \u201cWe say that we believe the SETL blockchain will do to payments and finance what the container did to shipping and world trade,\u201d said Randall, who used to be CEO of the Chi-X Europe stock market, which helped open European equity markets to competition in 2007.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/johndetrixhe', 'name': u'John Detrixhe', 'twitterhandle': u'johndetrixhe'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-15/ex-barclays-chairman-walker-joins-blockchain-startup-setl', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 15, 0, 1, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Ex-Barclays Chairman Walker Joins Blockchain Startup SETL'}, {'articleText': u' Blockchain, the bitcoin-linked software ledger that\u2019s touted as a way to speed up and simplify how transactions are recorded, just won the backing of\xa0finance and technology titans including IBM, Wells Fargo & Co. and London Stock Exchange Group Plc.

IBM is contributing tens of thousands of lines of existing code to the project, as well as dedicated developers and intellectual property, according to a statement.\xa0 The open-source software will enable others to \u201ctransform the way business transactions are conducted,\u201d according to the statement Thursday. Blockchain is the software that makes bitcoin possible, providing an immutable and transparent means of recording each time the digital currency is transferred from one person to another. The world of finance has taken notice, with a gold rush of startups saying their blockchain-related technologies can process virtually any kind of trade or money transfer in minutes instead of current times measured in days. \u201cAs with any early-stage, highly-complex technology that demonstrates the ability to change the way we live our lives and conduct business, blockchain demands a cross-industry, open source collaboration to advance the technology for all,\u201d Jim Zemlin, executive director at the Linux Foundation, said in the statement. Other participants include major parts of the financial system\u2019s infrastructure: Swift, the network that banks around the world use to notify each other of financial transactions, and CLS, the largest cash-settlement system in the $5.3 trillion currency market. Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp., Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., State Street Corp. and\xa0Accenture Plc are also members, as is the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts, a joint-effort of faculty at Cornell University, Cornell Tech and the University of California at Berkeley. Digital Asset Holdings LLC, which is led by former JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive Blythe Masters, is contributing code, developer resources and its\xa0Hyperledger brand name. This isn\u2019t the first blockchain consortium. R3, a startup headed by former ICAP Plc executive David Rutter, has signed up more than 20 banks including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale SA, Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan. R3 is studying how trading of securities, derivatives and loans can be overhauled by using distributed ledger and blockchain technology. R3 and JPMorgan have also committed to contributing to the Hyperledger project, according to the statement. With a digital ledger, as long as banks or exchanges, all of whom are known to each other, verify that one company has the funds or assets to transact with another company, the settlement and clearing time is reduced to seconds. Fundamental to that prospect, however, is that various digital ledger applications can connect and communicate with each other. That\u2019s the aim of the new consortium, according to Zemlin. \u201cDistributed ledger systems today are being built in a variety of industries but to realize the promise of this emerging technology, an open source and collaborative development strategy that supports multiple players in multiple industries is required,\u201d he said in the statement. The best-known blockchain is the one that powers bitcoin. While it relies on anonymous users to verify and maintain its history of every bitcoin transaction, banks and financial institutions are exploring the technology to see if it can allow known users to interact. That\u2019s because regulated financial institutions must abide by regulations to prevent money laundering and know-your-customer rules. A group of IBM engineers has been building the technology to contribute to the open-source project for the past year.

Inside the hushed, white-tableclothed establishment that is frequented by socialites and businesspeople, the hostess seats customers for Le Cirque\u2019s $165 six-course dinner depending on whether a reservation came through OpenTable Inc. If the booking was through the online system, the hostess seats patrons at a table assigned by OpenTable\u2019s table-management tool. Then from the moment the diner sits down, Micros\u2019s point-of-sale service kicks in, collecting orders and other information until the final credit-card swipe. Selections are relayed to the kitchen and bar, where chefs and bartenders get busy preparing appetizers and cocktails. It\u2019s all part of a push by Le Cirque\u2019s parent company, Le Cirque International LLC, which owns about a dozen fine-dining establishments worldwide, to embrace technology starting five years ago -- a trend Le Cirque plans to extend, said Co-Chief Executive Officer Carlo Mantica. \u201cThe restaurant industry is a laggard in technology adoption,\u201d Mantica said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re at a brink of a disruption and technology will see greater and greater adoption in the next five to 10 years.\u201d Restaurants like Le Cirque and their growing appetite for technology are now helping to spur a deals boom for providers of software and other services to the market. Oracle yesterday said it was purchasing Micros -- which counts restaurants as key customers -- in its biggest acquisition since its $5.7 billion takeover of Sun Microsystems Inc. in 2010. Earlier this month, Priceline Group Inc. agreed to buy OpenTable for $2.6 billion to add restaurant bookings to its travel business. Google Inc. last month also brought on the staff of Appetas Inc., a startup that helps restaurants build better websites. The activity is ramping up as the opportunity for technology providers with restaurants is set to grow. More than half of fine-dining operators plan to spend more on customer-facing technology such as mobile applications this year, with half of casual-dining operators and 41 percent of family-dining establishments anticipated to do the same, according to a 2013 survey by the National Restaurant Association. The total point-of-sale software market in the U.S. has also expanded 3.3 percent annually from 2009 to a projected $1.3 billion this year, according to Ibisworld. As a result, more technology companies are rushing to position themselves with offerings for restaurants. NetSuite Inc. sells financial software to restaurants like Australia\u2019s Guzman y Gomez Mexican dining chain. Intuit Inc. markets its QuickBooks small business accounting software to restaurants. Others such as G4Technologies Corp. have developed specific tools for dining companies, such as its AccuBar beverage-tracking system to help restaurateurs figure out when they need to order more wine or stock up on liquor. \u201cIt\u2019s still a very untapped market,\u201d said Dave Grimm, founding partner of Centennial, Colorado-based G4Technologies, of the restaurant industry. That\u2019s set to change, he said, as \u201ctechnology is such a part of everyone\u2019s lives, people are going to wonder how they ever ran a restaurant without it.\u201d For big technology companies like Oracle and Priceline, purchasing a restaurant-specific business also helps widen the door for them to sell other parts of their product line-up to the establishments. Oracle has acquired several retail-specific software companies in the past few years to build up its offerings to restaurants, hotels and other hospitality providers. The Micros deal was also a relative bargain at 17 times Micros\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with the median multiple of 22 for Internet and software acquisitions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cWe anticipate delivering compelling advantages to companies within the hospitality and retail industries with the acquisition of Micros,\u201d Oracle Co-President Mark Hurd said in a statement about the deal yesterday. Oracle bought Micros with this potential in mind, said Christine Dover, a research director at IDC. Oracle could create a platform that integrates services -- including software for accounting, point of sale, workforce scheduling, and inventory management -- into a single solution, she said. Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, declined to comment beyond its statement yesterday. Micros, headquartered in Columbia, Maryland, didn\u2019t respond to a call for comment. Restaurants have been slow to incorporate new technology, partly because the dining market is fragmented and filled with mom-and-pop operations that buy from suppliers at their own pace. In addition, some establishments have resisted the cost of new software. Almost 75 percent of dining operators described implementation expenses as the biggest factor preventing them from adding more consumer-facing tools, according to the National Restaurant Association\u2019s 2013 survey. \u201cSmall business owners are not tech savvy and they\u2019re not necessarily coming from a tech background,\u201d Daniel Bohlen, owner of East Village Asian Diner in San Diego, said in an interview. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of missed opportunity by not offering reasonably priced services for small businesses.\u201d Yet the attitudes are changing now as more restaurants deal with the impact of mobile applications like GrubHub Inc. and other food-ordering services and technology, said software providers and restaurateurs. \u201cRestaurant companies are realizing that it may seem like the oldest of the old-school industries -- you buy some ingredients and cook them -- yet all of these industries are getting disrupted by the cloud,\u201d said Andy Lloyd, general manager of commerce products at NetSuite. Oracle\u2019s CEO Larry Ellison has been one of NetSuite\u2019s big backers.

The auction of 29,656 bitcoins, part of more than 144,000 the FBI transferred to U.S. Marshals after shutting down the Silk Road marketplace and arresting its operator last year, represented a rare opportunity to secure a large cache of the virtual currency. While the actual price of the winning bid isn\u2019t known, the cache sold on June 30 was worth about $19 million at current exchange prices. Vaurum is a Palo Alto, California-based startup that enables companies including banks and brokerages to trade and store bitcoins on behalf of customers. Earlier this year it raised $4 million in seed funding from investors including Draper, Battery Ventures and America Online Inc. co-founder Steve Case. Vaurum said it was incubated last year by Boost, which invests in bitcoin startups and was founded by Tim Draper\u2019s son, Adam Draper. \u201cWe knew we were going to build a really interesting business around it, and we needed a real strong piece of bitcoin to do it,\u201d Draper said at a press conference today. \u201cThis is really going to make money transfer and deal-making much easier than it ever was in the past.\u201d Vaurum said it has started trading platforms in emerging markets where it is also difficult to get access to bitcoin. The company is initially targeting India, Brazil, Argentina and Turkey. \u201cCollectively, we\u2019ve been brainstorming to come up with new ways to help grow global bitcoin adoption,\u201d Vaurum Chief Executive Officer Avish Bhama said in the statement. \u201cWhat we came up with is a way to leverage our exchanges and utilize the auctioned pool of bitcoins, as well as market making strategies, to help provide liquidity in these underserved markets.\u201d Draper\u2019s and Vaurum\u2019s vision of bitcoin as a more stable alternative to some currencies stands in contrast to executives like JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett, who have expressed doubts about bitcoin. Bankers including Dimon, 58, have predicted bitcoins probably won\u2019t last after governments subject them to rules and standards akin to those for other payment systems. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not around in 10 or 20 years,\u201d Buffett, the billionaire chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., told CNBC in March. \u201cIt does not meet the test of a currency.\u201d SecondMarket, Rangeley Capital, Pantera Capital Management, Bitcoin Shop and Coinbase Inc. all said they were among bidders in the auction with offers that fell short. Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera, said that the spectacle of the U.S. government auctioning bitcoins suggested that \u201csupply creates its own demand.\u201d \u201cThe publicity created a tremendous amount of demand,\u201d Morehead wrote in an e-mail. \u201cWe had several large new players bid.\u201d Micky Malka, founder of Ribbit Capital, a venture capital fund which buys bitcoins and backs bitcoin companies, echoed that sentiment today. \u201cWe bid, and we are happy to see that there are a lot of institutional buyers interested in bitcoin, which clearly have a lot of potential,\u201d Malka said. Because liquidity on the exchanges is low -- a trade of 500 bitcoins can move prices -- the auction offered a chance to avoid paying a premium. More bitcoins may be sold later, U.S. Marshals have said. The sale excludes bitcoins the government obtained from computer hardware owned by Ross William Ulbricht, who the U.S. said ran Silk Road. The marketplace was an online bazaar where anonymous users allegedly bought and sold heroin, LSD, phony passports and computer hacking services. Ulbricht is contesting charges and filed a claim asserting ownership of the bitcoins. The price of bitcoins skyrocketed in 2013 to $1,147 from around $12 as technologists and speculators flocked to the digital currency, before dropping sharply amid regulatory crackdowns in China, Russia and elsewhere. One bitcoin fetched about $644 yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which represents an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. Bitcoins, which exist as software and aren\u2019t controlled by any single authority or country, emerged in 2009 out of a paper authored under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

While Apple didn\u2019t mention bitcoin specifically, its developer terms now allow for certain \u201capproved virtual currencies,\u201d without saying what those were. Apps that use the digital money must comply with state and federal laws wherever they\u2019re designed to work, the terms say. The change signals that Apple is warming up to virtual currencies after previously blocking programs like Blockchain.info from its App Store. Bitcoin is the most popular digital currencies, which governments are struggling to determine how to regulate because they exist only as software. \u201cThis is a sign that the ecosystem is maturing and gaining credibility,\u201d Bill Lee, an investor in bitcoin wallet BitGo, said in an e-mail. \u201cTo be clear, I still think bitcoin is in its infancy as a technology, but its acceptance is becoming more and more mainstream.\u201d Bitcoin entrepreneurs were already predicting an explosion of activity. \u201cGet ready for a plethora of bitcoin iOS apps!\u201d bitcoin venture capitalist Adam Draper said in an e-mail. \u201cVery exciting news!\u201d Developer Rob Banagale said he\u2019s planning to submit a new version of his app, called Gliph, which was kicked out of Apple\u2019s store last year because it let users send bitcoins to each other in instant messages. Banagale had to strip out that function for iOS devices; the app is only fully functional on phones and tablets that use Google Inc.\u2019s Android operating system. \u201cIf anything, Apple had more to lose by keeping bitcoin off the App Store,\u201d said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. \u201cBitcoin users were not going to give up bitcoin - they were giving up on the iPhone.\u201d After Apple removed Blockchain, several people posted videos online destroying their iPhones. One user shot his iPhone with a sniper rifle, another smashed it with a metal bar and another threw it down a flight of stairs. After topping $1,000 late last year, Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted to $360.84 in April. It has since rebounded, reaching about $667 yesterday. While bitcoin and other virtual currencies still aren\u2019t used by many retailers and service providers, they are gaining acceptance. Last month, satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp. said it will soon begin accepting bitcoin payments from subscribers. Getting access to iPhones could help increase bitcoin\u2019s use, as Apple is the top U.S. smartphone manufacturer, with a 41 percent average share of the market in the three months ending in March, according to ComScore Inc. Until now, most users have had to use their PCs or Android phones to pay for goods and services with bitcoin at food carts, restaurants and stores. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that Apple allows bitcoin transmission to occur,\u201d Banagale said in an interview. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get apps into the App Store, bitcoin will always going to be suppressed in its potential.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-03/apple-allows-virtual-currencies-in-apps-opening-door-to-bitcoin', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 3, 4, 1, 0, 16000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Apple Allows Virtual Currencies in Apps, Opening Door to Bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin, which tumbled last year after an exchange that traded the virtual currency lost its holdings and collapsed, held up today after another market, Bitstamp, suspended trading because of a breach. Prices for bitcoins rose 4 percent to almost $284 as of 4:45 p.m. in New York, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which represents an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. That compares with an average daily move of about 3 percent during the previous 30 days. Bitstamp, an online platform in Europe, said on its website today that it\u2019s temporarily suspending services after losing fewer than 19,000 bitcoins in a breach of electronic wallets used for operations. The loss amounts to a \u201csmall fraction\u201d of the platform\u2019s reserves, and bitcoins held by customers before yesterday\u2019s suspension \u201care completely safe and will be honored in full,\u201d it said. Bitcoin prices plunged by more than half last year amid cyber thefts, mounting competition and moves by governments to head off its potential use in criminal transactions. While Bitstamp is among several key exchanges, it\u2019s dwarfed by bigger platforms, accounting for about 5 percent of dollar transactions in the past 30 days, according to Bitcoin Charts, which tracks the virtual currency. Mt.Gox, once the world\u2019s largest exchange for digital-currency transactions, went offline in Tokyo in February after losing 850,000 bitcoins, then valued at about $473 million.

Gradual distrust in the dong motivates people to use bitcoin.\u201d Two virtual currency exchanges that started in Vietnam this year are adding to the woes of a communist government that has seen the dong\u2019s 26 percent slide since 2004 burnish the appeal of gold and dollars. The Southeast Asian nation\u2019s monetary authority has followed China in banning bitcoin transactions at banks. Pressure on businesses to discourage its use prompted a cafe in Hanoi to stop accepting the digital currency. \u201cBitcoin is like digital gold,\u201d Dominik Weil, a consultant with Ho Chi Minh City-based VBTC Vietnam Ltd., which operates an exchange that trades bitcoin for the local currency, said in a July 17 interview. The dong\u2019s depreciation is aiding the development of an underground system for bitcoin as \u201cpeople are looking for a secure storage of wealth,\u201d he said. The State Bank of Vietnam\u2019s Feb. 28 warning on its website that the use of bitcoin \u201cis not lawfully approved and protected\u201d didn\u2019t stop companies from creating a global exchange for brokers in March. A second bourse that caters to users within Vietnam started this month. The monetary authority said it doesn\u2019t recognize bitcoin and has banned banks from using virtual currencies. The central bank \u201chas been warning organizations and individuals to not hold, invest or execute any transactions involving bitcoin or any other similar virtual currencies because possession, trading and utilization of bitcoin and similar virtual currencies as assets pose risks and are not lawfully recognized nor protected,\u201d the monetary authority said in an e-mailed statement yesterday in response to Bloomberg questions. China\u2019s central bank in December banned financial institutions from transactions in bitcoin and Thailand\u2019s foreign-exchange rules bar its conversion into other currencies. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has said it plans to issue regulations requiring facilitators of virtual currency exchanges to verify identities of customers and report suspicious transactions to the police. Bitcoin is the latest threat to the dong in Vietnam where dollars and gold are often given as wedding gifts and are preferred as payment for large transactions such as house purchases. In 2011, the government began taking steps to reduce the dollarization of its economy. The central bank directed lenders to cut interest rates on dollar deposits and sought to curb a black market for the greenback. While some Vietnamese landlords still demand rent for high-end apartments in dollars, goods and services are prohibited from being priced in U.S. currency. The government has had to deal with runs on banks and credit cooperatives that collapsed and is \u201cvery suspicious\u201d of new financial instruments that could threaten macro-economic stability, according to Fred Burke, managing director of Baker & McKenzie (Vietnam) Ltd. in Ho Chi Minh City. \u201cWith something like virtual currencies, there can be an even bigger feeling of loss of control,\u201d Burke said in a July 23 phone interview. \u201cIt undermines the power of the state.\u201d The global exchange run by Bitcoin Vietnam Co. has seen the number of users rise to more that 1,800 since it started in March, with about 150 bitcoin trades valued at about $86,200, according to Weil. The domestic exchange operated by VBTC has about 300 users with two bitcoins traded so far, he said, adding that both companies are owned by the same startup. The bourses in Ho Chi Minh City, run out of a home along a narrow alley where neighbors raise chickens and sell vegetables, have been scrutinized by local authorities and the police, though their operations haven\u2019t been hindered, Weil said. \u201cThey are sending out messages that, \u2018We don\u2019t like it,\u2019\u201d Weil said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ban it. Some people hope this bitcoin thing will go away.\u201d The government\u2019s anti-bitcoin campaign is, however, discouraging some businesses. A Hanoi cafe that accepted bitcoin until April no longer accepts digital money, its co-owner, Quang Hung, said in a July 24 phone interview. Vietnam lacks regulations on the use of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, the Thoi Bao Ngan Hang newspaper reported July 23, citing an interview with Major General Nguyen Hung Linh, the head of investment, currency and finance security at the Ministry of Public Security. The government will need a transition period to formulate solutions and responses to digital money, the report quoted him as saying. Officials at the department didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment via phone and a hand-delivered letter. The central bank devalued the dong for the first time in a year on June 19, weakening the reference rate by 1 percent. Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. expects the authority to further weaken the currency by the end of the year, economics analyst Eugenia Fabon Victorino wrote in a June 19 note. The dong has slipped 0.6 percent this year to 21,230 per dollar, while currencies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore have strengthened, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bitcoin has surged from $13.28 at the start of 2013 to $567.86 as of 3 p.m. local time today. The virtual currency reached a high of $1,147 in December and plunged in the first quarter of this year following the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange. Dwindling faith in the dong along with the growing popularity of smartphones and electronic commerce will help bitcoin gain acceptance in Vietnam, according to Kien, the founder of the parenting website. He has received one payment of 0.03 bitcoin so far. \u201cBitcoin could play a big role in Vietnam,\u201d Le Thao, the founder of a startup in Hanoi to create software for virtual-currency touchscreen kiosks, said in a July 21 interview. \u201cIt\u2019s unstoppable in the world.

Desperate to find a way out of the cage it put itself in, the defaulted nation is going ahead with a plan to go native. It will let debt holders exchange foreign-currency bonds for new ones subject to domestic laws and paid through the Argentine central bank instead of the U.S. trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, and allow those opting to keep their notes also to be paid locally. It will also have a window for the holdouts, Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital, should they change their minds and agree to accept the terms that are being dictated to them. Which will probably not make things go any easier for them in Judge Thomas Griesa\u2019s New York courtroom. Guess they figured they don\u2019t have much more to lose, right? Citigroup is probably breathing a little easier. This decision appears to help it sidestep the issue of being caught between Griesa\u2019s previous ruling blocking interest payments to exchange bondholders until the holdout bondholders get paid 100 cents on the dollar and Argentina\u2019s demand that the bank proceed with making payments to customers holding the country\u2019s debt. We wonder if this development is going to pre-empt the commercials we were hoping to see. American television viewers were being pulled into the legal showdown through advertisements -- paid propaganda, to be honest -- from the holdout hedge funds decrying the fate of Argentines who held the country\u2019s debt. One 60-second commercial focuses on the case of a woman who lost her life savings after buying government notes to pay for the care of her 97-year-old father. \u201cArgentina, these people deserve better,\u201d the narrator intones. It\u2019s a response to the full-page newspaper advertisements Argentina has taken out in newspapers around the world ripping Griesa and the hedge funds.

For one day, at least, we got your attention. One reader pointed out that it\u2019s unclear just exactly what the terms of Edwards\u2019s employment contract are, and that it might be wrong to assume that he\u2019d be leaving money on the table if he walked away just before a change in ownership. That was the impression that came from BMO Capital Markets\u2019 David Maris in a research note yesterday, in which he also noted that, instead of the resignation being a bad omen, it \u201cmay be a sign that a strategic transaction marking a new chapter in Allergan\u2019s growth may be nearing.\u201d Which certainly got more interesting when the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Allergan may be in the hunt for Salix Pharmaceuticals, a deal that would add a layer or two of complication to the uber-hostile, $53 billion takeover attempt by Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square and Michael Pearson\u2019s Valeant. The reactions from the parties\u2019 shares didn\u2019t help much. Salix rose, naturally, which only adds to its market value and thus the expense of Valeant\u2019s proposed buyout of Allergan should Allergan complete that deal. Allergan rose, probably because the prospect of a defensive acquisition bolsters its defense as well as adds the wrinkle of a possible inversion play: Salix itself is in the middle of trying to buy an Ireland-based unit of Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, the Journal reports. Although there\u2019s no telling whether Allergan would go for the Cosmo stuff as well as Salix. And Valeant rose because...Why did Valeant rise? Because investors see the Allergan-Salix news as a sign this tractor pull that apparently had started to weigh on Valeant shares might finally be coming to an end? A relief rally? Anyway, we called Allergan to see if anyone would tell us the particulars of Edwards\u2019s employment contract. Nope. *** Thinking about your Christmas shopping yet? Economic forecasters are. As Anna-Louise Jackson and Anthony Feld report, inbound-container traffic at two key ports in California suggest U.S. retailers are preparing for a busy holiday season. Chris Christopher, director of U.S. consumer economics at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts, forecasts retail sales will grow 4.2 percent in November and December on a year-over-year basis, compared with 3.1 percent in both 2013 and 2012. This has potentially positive implications not just for big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s and Sears., but also for the companies that carry the merchandise, including A.P. Moeller-Maersk, Swift Transportation, Werner Enterprises and J.B. Hunt. Predicting December sales in August seems like one of the more complicated tasks in economic forecasting, combining as it does variability in consumer confidence, unpredictable wintry weather, transportation snafus and, this year, the chance of a labor disruption. The calendar shows that, with Black Friday on Nov. 28, there are 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, one more than last year. So that\u2019s something. On the other hand, it\u2019s still five days shorter than the longest holiday shopping season possible. A recent Gallup Poll found that 45 percent of Americans report spending more today than they were a year ago, versus 18 percent spending less. On the other hand, the poll found we\u2019re spending our money on utilities and health care, rather than on the activities and items we actually want. And what will we want, once the Thanksgiving turkey is in our bellies? Yet more singing ice princesses, it appears. Or maybe a monster with gas issues. Better soundproof that playroom. *** Tomorrow is the start of the Kansas City Fed\u2019s three-day economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and you know what that means. Not much, probably. Janet Yellen\u2019s speech is likely to track well-telegraphed themes, and by the sounds of this handy guide by Matthew Boesler and Simon Kennedy on what to look for, Mario Draghi will have more to talk about. Yellen will be all about wage growth and persistent slack in the labor market and about the seemingly never-ending need to continue stimulus, even though things are looking up, generally, with scant inflation. Draghi, however, has some issues on his hand, with stagnating economies and the lingering risks of deflation that aren\u2019t being helped by the euro -- or Yellen\u2019s dovish stance. Meanwhile, we would kill to be there with, say, a 9-foot, 5-weight Sage rod, a floating line and some grasshopper patterns. *** Sure, some people may say the immediacy of a Scripps Networks takeover is slim, but you can\u2019t tell that from its price. We tend to jump for anything Tara Lachapelle writes because the smartest stories make our job easier, and she finds that in the days following 21st Century Fox\u2019s aborted attempt to buy Time Warner Inc., Scripps has risen to match Time Warner\u2019s multiple based on expectations it\u2019s going to be a target. She writes Discovery Communications had been kicking the tires last year, and throws Viacom and Disney in the discussion, while citing Wunderlich Securities as saying price might be an issue.

Then again, it could get worse. That\u2019s the concern voiced by those who see the pending $42.5 billion acquisition of TWC by Comcast as having the potential to take those subscribers from the frying pan to the fire, and it\u2019s why the deal could risk foundering. Todd Shields and David McLaughlin report that amid regulatory scrutiny of a deal that will only concentrate ownership and power if Comcast wins TWC, this is exactly the kind of power authorities worry about when reviewing a deal. Especially when the power\u2019s about to shift into the hands of a company that\u2019s been found to employ the same tactics. When Comcast bought NBC Universal, it had to agree to arbitration in pricing disputes because it had \u201ccut the satellite-TV share in its home market by withholding professional baseball, basketball and hockey programming,\u201d Shields and McLaughlin report, citing the FCC order. Writing as we are from Comcast\u2019s hometown, we can tell you that there is cause for concern. Moreover, the cost of sports programming now is officially insane. Because of player salaries. *** More and more, golf looks like the new tennis. For a while the two country-club sports were moving in opposite directions, like bond prices and yields. Tennis was in decline as an American pastime, be it at the local park or on television. Golf, with a Tiger on its side, was soaring as if it were hit by a 9-iron. Now golf is struggling too.

Skeptics were already questioning the currency\u2019s future amid increasing regulatory oversight and after bitcoin\u2019s slide had made it one of the biggest money-losing investments of 2014, worse than oil or the ruble. Bitcoin was valued at about $272 on Monday, compared with more than $1,100 in late 2013, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Draper bought about 32,000 bitcoins at government auctions last year. He\u2019s been investing them in various startups building on bitcoin technology, which can be used to facilitate cheap international money transfers or buy assets like gold.

The virtual currency was up 10 percent at $340 as of 4:40 p.m. in London, according to Bitstamp data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell 14 percent during the weekend. Bitcoin users must grapple with volatility in the unregulated currency even as it wins wider acceptance from mainstream businesses such as online travel-booking service Expedia Inc. and satellite-television company Dish Network Corp. Recent price declines were reinforced by the unique way in which new bitcoins are added, said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \u201cMiners,\u201d who authenticate transactions using the currency and record them in bitcoin\u2019s public ledger, receive new bitcoins for their services. Because their work requires fixed investments in expensive hardware, the lower the price of the coins they generate, the more they have to sell to cover their costs. \u201cAll this describes a negative, self-reinforcing cycle,\u201d Luria said in an e-mail. \u201cAnd bitcoin does not have liquidation value to set a bottom - not cash on the balance sheet, no hard assets.\u201d Unlike traditional currencies, virtual currencies such as bitcoin often have a fixed supply and can\u2019t respond to changes in demand, making them prone to greater volatility, the Bank of England said in a report last month.

Trendon Shavers, 33, founder of Bitcoin Savings and Trust, raised at least 764,000 bitcoins by promising investors a return of as much as 3,641 percent, prosecutors said. Instead, he used bitcoins from new investors to cover payments owed to earlier clients, while also paying for his own Las Vegas gambling and spa treatments, according to the U.S. At the peak of his scheme in 2011 and 2012, Shavers held about 7 percent of all bitcoins in circulation, prosecutors said. \u201cI know what I did was wrong and am very sorry,\u201d Shavers said at a court hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in Manhattan Monday. Shavers\u2019s case came as the U.S. intensifies its scrutiny of bitcoins. Prosecutors also won the conviction of Ross William Ulbricht for running Silk Road, an online bazaar where people anonymously used the digital currency to buy heroin, phony passports and hacking services. He was sentenced to life in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Ferrara said Monday the government\u2019s evidence against Shavers included electronic messages as well as bank records. Federal investigators determined Shavers invested some of his victims\u2019 funds with Mt. Gox, a digital currency exchange based in Japan, according to Ferrara.\xa0 Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan in February 2014 after disclosing it couldn\u2019t account for about 850,000 units of the virtual currency. "The evidence would show the money he received from Investor B was used to pay Investor A -- in other words, he had the tell-tale signs of a Ponzi scheme," Ferrara said. Shavers faced as long as 20 years in prison on the securities fraud charge. He\u2019s scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan on Feb. 3. Under a deal struck with the U.S., Shavers agreed not to challenge any sentence from 33 months to 41 months. He also agreed to pay a $5 million fine. The case is U.S. v.

Though he can\u2019t promise you heaven, he is offering a haven: a condo in the Caribbean that comes with a new passport and almost zero taxes. Meet Roger Ver, ex-U.S. citizen, ex-convict, millionaire investor, self-described libertarian and founder of Passports for Bitcoin.com. The ever-expanding universe of what you can buy with bitcoins includes a hotel stay in Rome, a kimono in Tokyo, and cable TV in the U.S. Ver, a pioneer investor in bitcoin startups, now says he can add citizenship to the list. Specifically, that\u2019s the right to live in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, two sun-kissed islands a three-hour flight from Miami. St. Kitts has run an invest-and-become-a-citizen program since 1984, making it the oldest of its kind, says the country\u2019s website. Plunk down $400,000 for real estate and you get a passport that allows visa-free travel to 120 countries. There are no taxes on personal income or capital gains and the islands\u2019 restrictive disclosure laws offer shelter from outside scrutiny, according to the Tax Justice Network, a think tank that studies secrecy jurisdictions. Ver\u2019s website, in English, Russian and Chinese, offers a way to purchase a piece of that paradise with bitcoins. He says it will help people who are hemmed in by government restrictions on cash transactions. \u201cI\u2019m going to China next month to explain to people that bitcoin is the easiest way to pay for things outside the country,\u201d Ver said during a meeting this month at the plush 51st floor lounge of Tokyo\u2019s Roppongi Hills. A trim 35-year-old with a crew cut, in a black polo shirt and slacks, Ver looked a little like an electronics salesman at a big-box retailer. Still, a crowd of followers hung on his every word. A former derivatives trader at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a hacker, and a professional boxer were all there to pitch ideas or talk bitcoin with the master. Ver got rich investing in bitcoin early and has become a regular speaker at industry conferences. He\u2019s provided seed funds for a dozen prominent startups including Kraken, an exchange where people buy and sell the digital currency, and Blockchain, an online wallet used to store it. Bitcoin was invented in 2008 as a currency that could be used without government oversight. That\u2019s drawn people who want to trade illicit goods like drugs and guns. It\u2019s also gained support from libertarians like Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal who plans to build an artificial island where people can do whatever they want. Ver\u2019s passport site, his latest venture, is a scaled down version of that ideal. \u201cSt. Kitts\u2019 government is much more libertarian compared with the U.S.,\u201d Ver said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even close. So all these early bitcoin adopters, of course if they have the means, they\u2019d rather be a citizen of St. Kitts.\u201d However they pay to get in, people usually seek out countries like St. Kitts so they can evade taxes, says John Christensen, director of the Tax Justice Network. The U.S. Treasury Department last month said the island\u2019s passports are being used to facilitate financial crime. \u201cTo be blunt, we talk about places like St. Kitts as places where you go to escape from responsibilities,\u201d Christensen, an expert on tax havens, said by phone from London. \u201cSt. Kitts sells secrecy on the international market and, unsurprisingly, attracts all types of dirty money.\u201d Erasmus Williams, press secretary for St. Kitts, didn\u2019t respond to phone calls or e-mailed questions about the Citizenship-By-Investment program. A woman who answered the phone at the Office of the Prime Minister said the program is \u201cnot a matter of buying passports, it\u2019s about gaining citizenship.\u201d Nonetheless, no residency or visit is needed, just that $400,000 investment -- re-sellable after five years -- or a non-refundable $250,000 donation to the country, according to St. Kitts\u2019s official website. For those who don\u2019t get the message the first time, the site repeats in bold print: \u201cNo personal visit required.\u201d Still, wealthy Chinese have a tough time buying in because government limits on money transfers stop them from sending more than $50,000 worth of cash overseas each year. \u201cThe processing agent in St. Kitts told me he feels bad for all of his Chinese clients,\u201d Ver said. \u201cThey have to reach out to all different friends and relatives and get them to all send the money in drips and drabs. Bitcoin solves all of that.\u201d That\u2019s because it was designed to be anonymous. While an online public ledger stores every single Bitcoin transaction, the entries don\u2019t include the names and addresses required for bank accounts. In practical terms, a person in Beijing can buy bitcoins at home through BTC China, OKCoin or numerous other exchanges. With a few swipes on a smartphone, the money can then be beamed to St. Kitts with no government on Earth the wiser. The U.S. lost its allure for Ver after he was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison after selling about 14 pounds of explosive without a license on the EBay auction site. The product, \u201cPest Control Report 2000,\u201d was basically a firecracker to scare birds away from cornfields, Ver says. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I didn\u2019t hurt anybody. I had nothing but happy customers and the U.S. government locked me in a cage because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I want nothing to do with those people. I don\u2019t want to support them. I want them out of my life.\u201d Ver moved to Tokyo after finishing probation in 2006. He got his St. Kitts passport on Feb. 13, 2014, and abandoned his U.S. citizenship by the end of the month. \u201cI would have done it the same day if I could,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told me I had to have a one-week cooling-off period. They said, \u2018Did you know if you renounce citizenship, you won\u2019t be able to serve in the armed forces?\u2019 It was like, \u2018darn.\u2019\u201d The U.S. is unusual in taxing its citizens no matter where they live. Recent laws requiring disclosure of foreign bank accounts has driven up the number of wealthy Americans looking to sever ties with home. A record 2,999 renounced their citizenship in 2013. Although Ver\u2019s computer parts business made him a millionaire by the time he was 25, the real money came after he bought tens of thousands of bitcoins in 2011. They cost about $1 each then. Today they trade at about $600, according to the CoinDesk price index. Ver said he earned his moniker, Bitcoin Jesus, by telling anyone who would listen about bitcoin well before other venture capital companies paid any attention to the digital currency. One of the people who got a dose of Ver\u2019s sermons was the agent who processed his application for citizenship, Paul Bilzerian. Bilzerian is a former corporate raider who moved to St. Kitts after long battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and two stints in prison for securities fraud and conspiracy to defraud the government of millions. The two men bonded over the belief they\u2019d been targeted by U.S. authorities, according to Ver. Together, they started passportsforbitcoin.com in April, Ver said. Bilzerian, who is one of several-dozen licensed government processers in St. Kitts, declined to comment in an e-mail. Their website says a second passport insulates you from governments that intrude on citizen\u2019s lives. The site also has testimonials from Ver and Bilzerian\u2019s son, Dan, a 30-something professional poker player with millions of followers on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself with half-naked women, along with his gun collection. He didn\u2019t respond to e-mailed questions forwarded through his press agent. \u201cI value freedom more than almost anything else and a second or third passport provides me insurance just in case the U.S. government decides to value security over freedom,\u201d Bilzerian\u2019s son writes on the passport website.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-15/-bitcoin-jesus-calls-rich-to-tax-free-tropical-paradise', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 16, 13, 31, 54, 440000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'\u2018Bitcoin Jesus\u2019 Calls Rich to Tax-Free Tropical Paradise'}, {'articleText': u'      (Bloomberg) --  Hosts Catherine Cowdery and Doug Krizner\nfeature the best stories of the day from Bloomberg Radio,\nBloomberg Television, and over 150 Bloomberg News bureaus around\nthe world on Bloomberg Radio\u2019s Bloomberg Best.

The watchdog identified more than 70 risks linked to the currencies ranging from identity theft to the possibility hackers could target a trading platform. Virtual currencies have come under increased scrutiny from regulators and prosecutors around the globe. Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in Japan earlier this year amid claims it lost 850,000 Bitcoins. China\u2019s central bank barred financial firms from handling virtual currency transactions last year. \u201cRegulators have become alert to the potential for fraud and disruption,\u201d Richard Reid, a research fellow for finance and regulation at the University of Dundee, Scotland, said by e-mail. \u201cSuch attention from regulators is bound to curb the growth of markets such as Bitcoin.\u201d The EBA called on the EU to devise rules for trading platforms and start groups to oversee each internet currency to ensure that no individual can manipulate a currency. The EU should consider extending the scope of anti-money laundering law to better cover virtual currencies, according to the EBA. \u201cThe EBA is of the view that a regulatory approach to addressing the risks it has identified would require a substantial body of regulation,\u201d the regulator warned. Widespread use of the currencies could also make it harder for central banks to steer the economy by making the effects of monetary policy harder to predict, the EBA noted. Bitcoins emerged in 2009 out of a paper authored under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, retailers selling items from Gummi Bears to luxury homes have started accepting Bitcoins, and new companies have begun offering ways to ease its use as a payment system. The currency gained credibility after law enforcement and securities agencies said in U.S. Senate hearings that it could be a legitimate means of exchange. The price of Bitcoins topped $1,000 as speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. The price has since dropped to about $629.98, including a 1.8 percent decline today, on Bitstamp, an online exchange based in Slovenia. The EBA\u2019s announcement is \u201cnot very helpful\u201d and may only deter individual users of virtual currencies, according to Simon Dixon, a director of the U.K. Digital Currency Association, a group representing the country\u2019s virtual currency industry. \u201cBanks are not engaging with digital currencies yet as it is a person-to-person network that operates outside of banking,\u201d he said by e-mail. \u201cThe more likely result of the announcement is to scare people from using digital currencies rather than banks.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-04/eu-banks-must-shun-bitcoin-until-rules-in-place-eba-says', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 4, 15, 54, 17, 461000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'EU Banks Must Shun Bitcoin Until Rules in Place, EBA Says'}, {'articleText': u'  Expedia Inc. will start accepting bitcoins for hotel purchases, becoming the largest online travel service to adopt the virtual currency.

Expedia may start accepting bitcoins for airline tickets and trips if there\u2019s demand, Michael Gulmann, a vice president at Expedia, said in an interview. Web retailers such as Tiger Direct Inc. and Overstock.com Inc. already accept bitcoins to appeal to tech-savvy consumers using the virtual currency. CheapAir.com, another online travel agency, began accepting bitcoins in November. \u201cWe think there\u2019s growth potential for bitcoin as a currency,\u201d Gulmann said. \u201cWe see it now as something that\u2019s growing that we want to be a part of.

One place the shift has become evident is Hong Kong, where dollar selling has led the central bank to buy more than $9.5 billion since July 1 to prevent its currency from rallying as the sanctions stoked speculation of an influx of Russian cash. OAO MegaFon, Russia\u2019s second-largest wireless operator, shifted some cash holdings into the city\u2019s dollar. Trading of the Chinese yuan versus the Russian ruble rose to the highest on July 31 since the end of 2010, according to the Moscow Exchange. While no one\u2019s suggesting the dollar will lose its status as the main currency of business any time soon, its dominance is ebbing. The greenback\u2019s share of global reserves has already shrunk to under 61 percent from more than 72 percent in 2001. The drumbeat has only gotten louder since the financial crisis in 2008, an event that began in the U.S. when subprime-mortgage loans soured, and the largest emerging-market nations including Russia have vowed to conduct more business in their currencies. \u201cThe crisis created a rethink of the dollar-denominated world that we live in,\u201d said Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at Bank of America Corp.\u2019s U.S. Trust, which oversees about $380 billion. \u201cThis nasty turn between Russia and the West related to sanctions, that can be an accelerator toward a more multicurrency world.\u201d Such a transformation may take as long as 25 years, with the dollar remaining \u201ctop of the heap\u201d even as other currencies play a greater role, Quinlan said, speaking by phone on Aug. 4 from New York. The U.S. and EU announced further restrictions on trade with Russia over its support of insurgents in Ukraine on July 29. The additional sanctions limit state-owned banks\u2019 access to European and U.S. capital markets. Europe also imposed an embargo on weapons sales while the U.S. added a shipbuilder to a list of blocked defense-technology entities. MegaFon, a Moscow-based company that hasn\u2019t been targeted by the sanctions, is moving funds into the Hong Kong dollar, Chief Financial Officer Gevork Vermishyan said in a phone interview last week. Billionaire Alisher Usmanov\u2019s wireless operator has traditionally kept its foreign cash in U.S. dollars and euros, according to the company. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world\u2019s largest producer of nickel and palladium, is also keeping some of its cash in the Asian currency, two people with knowledge of the situation said last week, asking not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. The nickel producer keeps its free cash-flow in a variety of currencies and instruments, spokesman Petr Likholitov said last week, declining to elaborate or comment on the use of Hong Kong dollars. In addition, rich Russians are looking to move funds to banks in Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai, Danilo Lacmanovic, chief executive officer of Moscow-based Third Rome LLC, which manages $400 million on behalf of high net-worth individuals, said in a phone interview yesterday. Since the U.S. currency replaced gold as the bedrock of the financial system after World War II, the greenback has weathered numerous crises. It emerged from the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, endured the introduction of the euro almost three decades later and maintained its status as a haven currency even when the 2008 collapse spread from Wall Street to economies around the world. The Federal Reserve\u2019s unprecedented monetary stimulus to stem that crisis channeled cash into the economy through debt purchases, leading nations including Brazil and Germany to claim the U.S. was debasing its currency. The crunch increased interest in tenders divorced from a single nation\u2019s strength, spurring the International Monetary Fund to boost almost 10-fold the allocation of special drawing rights, a reserve asset whose value is based on a basket of currencies, and fueling demand for so-called virtual currencies, such as bitcoin. A $9 billion fine imposed on BNP Paribas SA, France\u2019s largest bank, by U.S. regulators in June has also made some institutions wary of the penalties dealing in dollars can bring, according to Steven Englander, the head of Group of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New York. BNP was banned from clearing certain dollar-denominated commodity trades for a year after the lender admitted to violating U.S. restrictions on doing business with Iran, Sudan and Cuba. \u201cYou used to think that you had to worry about the Fed and about the supply of dollars and the monetary policy reaction function, and now you have to worry about potentially sanctions and other kind of regulatory liabilities, so it\u2019s baggage,\u201d said Englander, speaking by phone on Aug. 4. \u201cIf you see yourself on the receiving end in some geopolitical dispute with the U.S., holding liquid dollar assets is risky.\u201d The risk may be something institutions stomach in the near term. About 38.8 percent of global payments by value were denominated in the U.S. currency in January 2014, up from 29.7 percent in January 2012, according to data compiled by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift. Use of the euro slipped from 44 percent to 33.5 percent of transactions over the same period. The dollar\u2019s share of foreign-exchange transactions has also increased. Buying or selling the greenback against another currency accounted for 87 percent of all trades in April 2013, about two percentage points more than in 2010, according to a September report from the Bank for International Settlements. Dollar pairs comprised about $705 billion of the $811 billion average daily volume seen by North American financial institutions this April, the Fed-sponsored Foreign Exchange Committee said last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape the stratosphere,\u201d Sebastien Galy, a senior currency strategist at Societe Generale SA in New York, said Aug. 1. It\u2019s \u201ca broad dollar world which is dominating everything and the consequences are suffered when there\u2019s mismanagement of the system. But it\u2019s one that has no good alternative at this point in time.\u201d The U.S. currency climbed against all 16 major peers last month as fighting in Ukraine and the downing of a Malaysian jet over the country enhanced the appeal of haven assets. It extended gains today as NATO warned of a Russian incursion in Ukraine under the \u201cpretext\u201d of a humanitarian mission, pushing its advance to 2.5 percent against the euro since the start of last month. It traded at $1.3354 as of 11:50 a.m. in New York. Citigroup forecasts a rally to $1.33 per euro by the end of the year, compared with a median forecast in a Bloomberg strategist survey of $1.32. SocGen predicts an advance to $1.32. China is making a push for greater use of its currency in international trade. The People\u2019s Bank of China extended a yuan swap line to Switzerland in July after agreeing a facility with the European Central Bank last year. The nation also agreed to allow companies to clear yuan-denominated transactions in London and Frankfurt for the first time. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought U.S. dollars in the foreign-exchange market this week to curb gains in the local dollar, which is pegged to the greenback, after purchasing $8.4 billion in July, the most since at least October 2012. Sanctions show the potential for an increasing reliance on economic measures -- such as restricting the use of a currency - - as \u201can alternative to military\u201d action, according to Marc Chandler, the chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. \u201cThis represents a big step in the evolution of U.S. foreign policy toward Russia,\u201d he said by phone on Aug. 4. \u201cThe real challenge is converting that financial power into political influence.\u201d  Download: Investor Faber Avoids U.S. Stocks, Invests in Dollar (Audio) ', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-06/russia-sanctions-accelerate-risk-to-dollar-dominance', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 8, 6, 15, 51, 14, 457000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Russia Sanctions Accelerate Risk to Dollar Dominance'}, {'articleText': u'  California officials said they have decided against regulating digital currencies such as Bitcoin under existing rules and instead will ask the legislature to take up the issue. After concluding in December that regulators had legal authority over Bitcoin, the California Department of Business Oversight has decided not to exercise it, spokesman Tom Dresslar said. The question of how and whether to regulate Bitcoin has confounded regulators around the world since it emerged in software form in 2009 from a paper authored by an anonymous computer scientist. Bitcoin proponents and some financial regulators say the digital currency is an important innovation that makes payments easier and cheaper. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether Bitcoin and the virtual currency industry will fulfill the growth prospects forecast by backers,\u201d Dresslar said by e-mail. \u201cPrudence dictates we take a deliberate approach and let the market further develop.

They stand a chance because Spiderwoman is on the case. So nicknamed for her work on State Street Corp.\u2019s \u201cSpider,\u201d the first ETF when it came to market in 1993, Kathleen Moriarty is the lawyer attempting to shepherd the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The twins, famous for their dispute with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg, aim to roll out the first ETF that invests in a virtual asset, an idea that has its skeptics. \u201cShe brings instant credibility to a less-than-credible investment product,\u201d Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund and ETF research at S&P Capital IQ. Moriarty, 61, who is 5-feet-1-inch tall with a silver bun of hair, has spent more than 20 years breaking ground in the fastest-growing segment of the money-management industry, guiding products to market such as the first hedge-fund replicator, the first physical commodity ETF and the first leveraged offering. She has built a reputation as the go-to lawyer for anyone seeking to sell an innovative ETF that regulators may scrutinize closely. \u201cI\u2019ve represented most everybody who\u2019s done an unusual ETF,\u201d Moriarty, a partner at New York law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, said in an interview at her office in Manhattan. The Bitcoin Trust has already had an unusual journey. Katten Muchin\u2019s executive committee initially rejected the idea of taking on the project because they believed bitcoins might be a Ponzi scheme. Moriarty asked the committee for four weeks to investigate. She came back convinced the virtual currency was \u201cnot an inherently fraudulent scheme,\u201d and won their assent. The world\u2019s smartest investors are divided about bitcoins. While billionaire investor Warren Buffett, 83, has said he\u2019ll be surprised if bitcoins last 10 or 20 years, Legg Mason Inc. stock picker Bill Miller and Michael Novogratz at private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC have both said they\u2019ve bought the virtual currency. Moriarty declined to say exactly where the Bitcoin Trust stands with regulators beyond indicating the SEC staff is still reviewing and commenting on the proposal. For any ETF, she said, the SEC first seeks to determine how to categorize its underlying assets, whether they are securities, a commodity, a currency or something else. It\u2019s not clear to many where, exactly, bitcoins should fall. \u201cWe think the closest thing is commodity money, like shells or deerskin,\u201d Moriarty said. A native of Chicago, Moriarty moved to New York when she was five after the death of her mother. She\u2019s lived in Manhattan for most of her life, except for her years studying psychology and art history at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, and getting a law degree at the University of Notre Dame near South Bend, Indiana, where she met her husband, Robert John Keefe. Between those schooling years, she had a stint as a paralegal in Washington, D.C., in the mid-1970s, where, she said, a young female college graduate had three options: Capitol Hill aide, secretary or paralegal. \u201cI didn\u2019t like politics and I couldn\u2019t type,\u201d she recalled. As a paralegal, \u201cI began to realize that the only difference between me and the lawyers was a law degree. They weren\u2019t any smarter than I was.\u201d Moriarty is one of a handful of people who, by helping to create and continually expand the scope of the industry, can claim credit for transforming the investment landscape, said Matt Hougan, president of research firm ETF.com. \u201cShe\u2019s a legend,\u201d said Hougan, whose company picked Moriarty for their first lifetime achievement award when they started the tradition in March to recognize accomplishments in the ETF world. An ETF is a bundle of securities that trades on an exchange like a common stock, usually tracking an index of equities, bonds or commodities. Today they hold $1.7 trillion in the U.S. and about $2.6 trillion worldwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and research firm ETFGI LLP. They give hedge funds and other big traders a tool for buying, or selling short, whole markets or market segments as frequently as they wish. ETFs have also broadened access for individual investors to those markets at prices unimaginable a generation ago. Back in 1993 when the first ETF, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, hit the American Stock Exchange, its success was far from certain. The Spider now holds $163 billion and is the most traded security in the world. \u201cWe all hoped it would be a success, maybe would get to $1 billion,\u201d Moriarty said. \u201cWe just had no idea what the market appetite would be. And I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d These days, she cultivates her reputation with a bit of flair. Spot her at a conference or industry event and she\u2019s likely to be wearing a brooch decorated with a large, sparkling spider. Her Madison Avenue office is peppered with various stuffed or inflated arachnids that sit atop stacks of paper, filing cabinets and chairs. While the Spiderwoman schtick is memorable, it\u2019s Moriarty\u2019s hard-won track record of slogging customer after customer through the SEC\u2019s approval process that does the real selling, said James Ross, head of ETFs at Boston-based State Street. Compared with mutual funds, ETFs typically face much higher regulatory hurdles, partly because they are listed on an exchange. And if a proposed product does something new, the review can be long. The most complex offerings can wait years before they receive approval. The task for the applicant\u2019s lawyer, according to Ross, is part art and part science, and Moriarty is particularly good at it. \u201cShe has the appropriate level of tenacity,\u201d said Ross, also part of the original Spider team. \u201cShe balances when to push versus when to let them breathe a little bit.\u201d Moriarty laughed when she heard that assessment and said it\u2019s true only when her client will let her find that balance. \u201cSome people who don\u2019t come from a regulated environment, like hedge funds, have a hard time understanding there isn\u2019t more than one SEC,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018Do it my way or we\u2019ll go somewhere else.\u2019\u201d When an application stalls, those customers sometimes call and demand that she harangue the SEC staff to get them moving. \u201cIf you nag people all the time, they will find you annoying. And if you annoy them, they will start doing things that will make it slower,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, yes, there\u2019s an art to knowing when to press and when not to press.\u201d Bitcoin is a software protocol for issuing and moving money across the Internet. There is now about $8 billion in bitcoin in circulation, according to CoinDesk, a news and pricing website. The Winklevoss brothers owned about $10 million in bitcoins when they filed their initial application with the SEC on July 1, 2013. The virtual currency has proven to be volatile. Prices plummeted earlier this year from a high of $1,147 in 2013 after the collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, once the world\u2019s largest, and China and Russia moved to block money laundering. One bitcoin currently sells for about $515, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Virtual Currency Monitor. The SEC in May issued an alert to investors on the risks of bitcoins and other virtual-currency investments, although it has not commented on the proposed bitcoin ETF. Hougan of ETF.com said he put the odds of the Bitcoin Trust making it to market at 45 percent in the next 18 months. S&P\u2019s Rosenbluth said it is impossible to predict whether the Bitcoin Trust would eventually get the SEC\u2019s consent. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be complicated. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen, but it\u2019s not a straightforward effort,\u201d Rosenbluth said. How Bitcoin is categorized by the SEC is meaningful. That can affect how much regulation a fund is subject to and by whom, influencing the degree of protection for shareholders and the costs they\u2019ll incur. It can also determine the level of taxation for investors. Once that\u2019s settled, Moriarty said, regulators examine whether the fund will perform as intended. For example, the SEC evaluates whether its share price will stay reasonably close to the value of its index throughout the trading day. Proposed ETFs are very rarely rejected because the SEC considers a product too risky for investors. Still, if the staff isn\u2019t comfortable with a proposed fund, it can simply keep asking for more information and demanding more disclosures until the applicant gives up. The Winklevoss twins have argued that bitcoins have a clear practical utility, especially in countries with underdeveloped banking systems. And a bitcoin ETF would make it much easier for people to buy them. \u201cThey really are very passionate about bitcoin,\u201d Moriarty said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think it will replace any currency, but that it can be very useful for a number of applications. They think it should be regulated and, as long as it should be regulated they should have some say in how.\u201d Whether it reaches the market or not, it\u2019s not the wildest ETF idea to cross Moriarty\u2019s desk. Someone once asked her to create a fund investing in yellowcake, a uranium concentrate powder that, when highly refined, can be used to make fuel for nuclear reactors or bombs. She declined. \u201cIf there weren\u2019t any realistic uses, I wouldn\u2019t be so happy about doing this,\u201d she said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-15/spiderwoman-brings-hope-to-winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-etf', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 8, 15, 4, 0, 1, 1000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Spiderwoman Brings Hope to Winklevoss Twins\u2019 Bitcoin ETF'}, {'articleText': u'  The trial of the man charged with running the Silk Road online drug bazaar has featured what prosecutors call the diary of a major trafficker, damaging testimony from a friend and a giveaway promotion for the \u201cbiggest stoner holiday\u201d of the year. Prosecutors are set to continue presenting their case Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan after a 1 1/2 day interruption caused by a snowstorm in the Northeast. The government may rest its case next week, while the defendant hasn\u2019t said whether he will take the stand. Jurors listened closely during the trial\u2019s first two weeks to evidence that the government hopes will tie the man at the defense table, Ross William Ulbricht, to \u201cDread Pirate Roberts.\u201d That\u2019s the online identity of the person -- or people -- who for almost three years ran the most notorious illicit website on a hidden, anonymous part of cyberspace called the dark net. \u201cThat really is one of the biggest challenges in prosecuting cybercrime,\u201d said Marcus Asner, a former head of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s unit that prosecutes computer crime. \u201cWith some detective work you often can pin it to a computer, but the challenge then is to pin it to an individual.\u201d The government claims that from January 2011 to October 2013, Ulbricht ran Silk Road, where customers used bitcoins to buy LSD, heroin, marijuana, Ecstasy, phony identification, computer hacking help and other illegal goods and services from thousands of sellers around the world. If convicted of charges including Internet drug trafficking and conspiracy, he faces the possibility of life in prison. Asner, now partner in the New York office of the firm Arnold & Porter LLP, said prosecutors face a challenge similar to those in more traditional cases involving drug trafficking, child pornography and identity theft. He said defendants in those cases go to great lengths to keep authorities from figuring out who they are. Prosecutors showed jurors evidence collected from Ulbricht\u2019s computer, including the diary, a list of servers used to run the site and online computer chats with Silk Road employees, in an effort to prove Ulbricht was in charge of its day-to-day operation. Ulbricht took the name \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d from the 1987 film \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d prosecutors claim. In the film, the name is taken by a series of pirates, who pass it along to another as each retires. Ulbricht, who denies breaking the law, claims that\u2019s what happened with Silk Road\u2019s Dread Pirate. Ulbricht isn\u2019t required to testify in his defense, and his lawyer, Joshua Dratel, hasn\u2019t disclosed what evidence he may present to show his client\u2019s innocence. Elements of the defense\u2019s theory have emerged in court filings and in Dratel\u2019s opening statement to jurors and his cross-examination of the government\u2019s witnesses. He argues he was set up as a \u201cfall guy\u201d to take the punishment when the U.S. targeted Silk Road. Prosecutors said they will also present evidence that Ulbricht tried to arrange as many as six killings, including the murder of a former Silk Road employee. The government claims Ulbricht paid $80,000 to an undercover agent, who misled Ulbricht into believing the hit had been carried out. In another alleged plot, prosecutors claim Ulbricht paid $150,000 to a drug dealer known as \u201credandwhite\u201d to kill another Silk Road user, \u201cFriendly Chemist.\u201d Friendly Chemist was blackmailing Ulbricht by threatening to disclose the identities of Silk Road vendors and customers, according to the government. U.S. authorities believe none of the murders were carried out. Ulbrict isn\u2019t charged in the New York case with the attempted murders-for-hire. He\u2019s charged with one of the alleged plots in federal court in Baltimore. Silk Road used the Tor network, which routs communications through multiple computers, to help users hide their identities while transacting more than 1 million drug transactions, according to the government. Silk Road required the use of bitcoin virtual currency, limiting the ability of authorities to identify people. Dratel surprised observers and Ulbricht\u2019s own family when he conceded at the start of the trial on Jan. 13 that his client had created Silk Road in early 2011 as an \u201ceconomic experiment.\u201d He passed the site to others after a few months when running it proved too stressful, according to Dratel. \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d was merely an online identity used by different people in connection with the site, he said. Dratel seized on testimony by a federal agent that just weeks before Ulbricht was arrested in October 2013, the agent believed there was probable cause to think Silk Road was run by Mark Karpeles, the former head of the bankrupt Mt. Gox Co. bitcoin exchange. Dratel told U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Forrest, who\u2019s overseeing the trial, that Karpeles was Silk Road\u2019s true mastermind and that he set up Ulbricht to take the blame. Karpeles, who lives in Japan, denies involvement with Silk Road. He hasn\u2019t been charged. The government claims Ulbricht\u2019s computer contained a personal journal containing \u201cdevastating confessions\u201d about his connection to the website. In entries shown to the jury, Ulbricht appears to write about coming up with the idea for the site, adding upgrades and struggling to keep up with Silk Road\u2019s rapid expansion. The government also tried to show that Ulbricht was the Dread Pirate on Oct. 1, 2013, the day he was arrested. Thomas Kiernan, a computer scientist with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told jurors that plainclothes agents tracked Ulbricht to a public library in his San Francisco neighborhood, then staged a fake domestic dispute to distract Ulbricht while agents grabbed his Samsung 700Z laptop from him, to avoid giving him time to close it and encrypt his files. Agents testified that they recovered online chats between Ulbricht and site employees with names such as \u201cLibertas,\u201d \u201cSamesamebutdifferent\u201d and \u201cInigo.\u201d In a March 2012 chat, prosecutors said, Ulbricht discussed a marijuana sale for April 20, or \u201c420,\u201d a date observed by marijuana users in the U.S. \u201cHere\u2019s a rough draft for ya,\u201d the U.S. claims Ulbricht said. \u201cRoll up a doobie and put your party hat on because the biggest stoner holiday is just around the corner, and we\u2019ve got alot of ganja to deliver!\u201d In the chat, he suggests giving away prizes every 420 seconds and even sending one customer on a \u201cdream vacation with all the trimmings!!!\u201d According to the government, Ulbricht joked about selling drugs to kids, \u201cand we\u2019re selling drugs here, first one\u2019s free little jonny! damn that sounds aweful.\u201d Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a Department of Homeland Security special agent, testified that he used the name \u201cCirrus\u201d when he infiltrated the site as an undercover administrator for several months as part of the government\u2019s investigation. Der-Yeghiayan told jurors that investigators maintained at least a dozen buyer and seller accounts on the illicit site, occasionally expressing frustration over the uncertain identities of the people they were dealing with. Prosecutors countered the defense theory through the testimony of Richard Bates, a software engineer who, as a friend of Ulbricht, helped him with free programming assistance for Silk Road. \u201cDid the defendant share a secret with you?\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Howard asked Bates, who testified in exchange for immunity from prosecution. \u201cHe shared with me that he created and ran the Silk Road website,\u201d said Bates, who frowned throughout his testimony. Bates said he purchased marijuana, MDMA, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Vicodin and an antibiotic from Silk Road using the name \u201cMelee.\u201d He testified that his friend told him in November 2011, almost two years before Ulbricht\u2019s arrest, that he had sold the site. If true, Ulbricht\u2019s sale of Silk Road may not matter for the purpose of the criminal charges, said Asner, the former prosecutor. He has admitted starting the site in 2011. And federal agents said his 2013 arrest showed him acting as the Dread Pirate. \u201cHe was literally caught with his fingers at the keyboard,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Howard said in his opening statement.

The virtual currency originated at the height of the financial crisis in November 2008. Bitcoins are created, or \u201cmined,\u201d by computers that solve difficult cryptographic problems to verify transactions. As more Bitcoins are created, the problems become more difficult.

A new survey suggests financial-services professionals are on board. Greenwich Associates found 94 percent of respondents say blockchain -- the ledger that drives bitcoin -- could be used in finance, according to a report to be released Wednesday. The software is touted as a way to speed up and simplify how trades of everything from stocks to loans and derivatives are processed. \u201cRevolution in the making -- that\u2019s what this feels like,\u201d Kevin McPartland, a co-author of the study with Dan Connell, said in a phone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity for some change here.\u201d A series of startups want to use the technology to execute and settle trades, saving Wall Street banks and investors billions of dollars by radically reducing a transaction\u2019s lifespan. That would free up capital that\u2019s pledged to back trades until they\u2019re settled, such as in the bank loan market where it took nearly 23 days to settle trades in 2013. McPartland and Connell, part of Greenwich\u2019s market structure and technology practice, interviewed 102 executives at banks, asset managers, financial technology firms and exchanges for their first research report on blockchain. Eighty-four percent of respondents said blockchain could reduce the risk a trade won\u2019t settle and the time that process takes, while 74 percent said it could alleviate the chance your counterparty to a trade won\u2019t make good on the deal. Markets where there is the least amount of trading infrastructure in place that still have high volume of transactions are the most likely to be affected by blockchain, McPartland said. Those include the loan market and trades in private over-the-counter derivatives that can\u2019t be backed by clearinghouses. Startups focused on bringing blockchain into finance have attracted funding and well-known supporters for the past year. Last month, Symbiont, which plans to use blockchain to make it quicker and cheaper to transfer assets between buyers and sellers, raised $1.25 million from financial industry heavyweights including former New York Stock Exchange chief Duncan Niederauer, former Citadel LLC executive Matt Andresen, and two co-founders of high-frequency trading firm Getco LLC, Dan Tierney and Stephen Schuler. Other firms investigating finance-related uses of blockchain include Digital Asset Holdings LLC, headed by former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker Blythe Masters; Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.; and the New York Stock Exchange. As deployed with bitcoin, blockchain is a public, anonymous database that\u2019s virtually impossible to tamper with. Some want to strip blockchain away from bitcoin for use on Wall Street, creating a private system where trading partners are known to each other. \u201cA number of hotly debated questions remain unanswered regarding capital markets\u2019 adoption of distributed ledger technology,\u201d the Greenwich analysts wrote in the report. \u201cCan Bitcoin and the blockchain be separated effectively?

Ross Ulbricht, 30, who used the moniker \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d offered people the chance to anonymously buy illegal merchandise and services with bitcoins. On Wednesday, a jury took just three and a half hours to find him guilty on all seven federal charges. Wearing a navy jacket, blue shirt and tan pants, Ulbricht didn\u2019t have a visible reaction to the verdict. His parents, Lyn and Kirk Ulbricht, both dropped their heads, while some of Ulbricht\u2019s supporters wept. \u201cRoss is a hero,\u201d a courtroom observer, Derrick Broze of Houston, shouted as U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest was wrapping up the proceedings. Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Dratel, said his client will appeal. Dratel said Forrest blocked him from calling witnesses supporting the defense. Prosecutors claimed Ulbricht ran Silk Road from 2011 to 2013, armed only with a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection. When he was arrested, his computer was filled with evidence showing he conceived the site, ran it and even tried to arrange the murder of five people who threatened the anonymity of buyers and sellers. Prosecutors told jurors that $213 million in bitcoins were used to buy drugs and other illegal items on the site. Ulbricht faces as long as life in prison when he\u2019s sentenced May 15. One of the counts carries a mandatory 20-year minimum. \u201cThe supposed anonymity of the dark web is not a protective shield from arrest and prosecution,\u201d Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement after the verdict. Ulbricht claimed he was set up as a \u201cfall guy\u201d by Mark Karpeles, the former head of the bankrupt Mt. Gox Co. bitcoin exchange, or by someone else who was the real Dread Pirate Roberts. A six-man, six-woman jury in Manhattan federal court rejected Ulbricht\u2019s claim that he only ran Silk Road for a few months. Charges against Ulbricht included trafficking drugs on the Internet, narcotics-trafficking conspiracy, running a continuing criminal enterprise, computer-hacking conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy. At the start of the trial on Jan. 13, Dratel told the jurors that his client started Silk Road as an \u201ceconomic experiment,\u201d then passed it to someone else after a few months. Ulbricht\u2019s online name was taken from a character in the 1987 film \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d prosecutors said. The Texas native was arrested in a San Francisco public library on Oct. 1, 2013, \u201ccaught red-handed\u201d after logging onto his computer as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d prosecutors said. Federal agents seized Silk Road, along with bitcoins worth $3.6 million, and shut down the site. The agents testified they found on Ulbricht\u2019s computer online chat transcripts, Silk Road maintenance logs, to-do lists, weekly reports, accounting entries and a computer journal detailing the beginnings and growth of Silk Road. The government also found more than $13 million in bitcoins, most of which they traced back to Silk Road. In a key pretrial ruling, Forrest in October rejected Ulbricht\u2019s request to bar electronic evidence seized from the laptop, his Gmail and Facebook accounts, and a Silk Road computer server in Iceland. Forrest ruled that because Ulbricht didn\u2019t claim any personal connection to the material, he lacked the ability to complain that police had seized it illegally. During the trial, Forrest blocked Dratel from presenting an expert in computer-based currencies and another in cybersecurity, saying he\u2019d failed to give prosecutors the required time to prepare. Outside court Wednesday, Ulbricht\u2019s parents blamed the judge for the verdict, saying they were \u201coutraged.\u201d \u201cI think it would have been a very different outcome if the jury had been permitted to hear all the evidence,\u201d Lyn Ulbricht said. The jurors heard evidence that Ulbricht paid $150,000 to someone claiming to be a member of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang to kill a Silk Road user who called himself FriendlyChemist. The government claimed FriendlyChemist sought to extort Ulbricht by threatening to publish a list of names and addresses of Silk Road sellers and buyers unless he was paid $500,000. Ulbricht didn\u2019t face murder solicitation charges in the trial and prosecutors said they don\u2019t believe any murders were carried out. Forrest said the government could use the evidence to show Ulbricht\u2019s connection to Silk Road. Ulbricht faces one murder solicitation charge in Baltimore. The case is U.S. v.

Argentine bonds have risen 4 percent\xa0and the Buenos Aires stock exchange has surged 13 percent since Macri defied opinion polls to come within 3 percentage points of front runner Daniel Scioli last month and force a runoff on Nov. 22. Betvote, a website that allows people to vote using bitcoin, now has the opposition candidate as an odds-on favorite. Macri has pledged to reverse President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s economic policies, removing currency controls within his first week in office, negotiating with hold-out bondholders and easing import restrictions. Still, while Macri may have the momentum, investors shouldn\u2019t underestimate Scioli\u2019s ability to harness his alliance\u2019s party structure, said Mauro Roca, an economist at Goldman Sachs & Co. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be tighter than people think,\u201d Roca said by phone from New York. \u201cMacri won momentum but the question is going to be how long he\u2019s able to maintain it.\u201d The focus in the campaign has turned to the third-placed candidate, Sergio Massa, and where the 5.4 million votes he received might go. That\u2019s not as easy to predict as it might initially seem, Roca said. Massa is a former cabinet chief under President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner who broke away to form his own movement. So while his voters are opposed to Fernandez\u2019s government many of them are still part of Peronism, the political movement named after former President Juan Domingo Peron. A poll by Elypsis, the only company to successfully predict the outcome of the first round, found Macri would get 47.8 percent against 37.2 percent for Scioli.\xa0While Scioli would get 41 percent of Massa\u2019s votes against 30 percent for Macri, the opposition candidate would also take votes directly from his rival. If both candidates maintain their votes from the first round and the votes from the remaining candidates are split evenly, Scioli would only require about 40 percent of Massa\u2019s votes to win, said Andy Tow, a political analyst who writes a blog about polling data. While Felipe Sola, a member of Massa\u2019s alliance who ran for governor of Buenos Aires province, said about 65 percent of their votes will go to Macri, Tow said it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly where they will go. \u201cNo one can deny that right now Macri has the advantage but this isn\u2019t decided and the difference in the end is going to be small,\u201d Tow, who also works as an adviser for ruling party Senator Juan Manuel Irrazabal, said by phone from Buenos Aires. Scioli is now trying to portray Macri as the harbinger of an economic adjustment that will result in devaluation, faster inflation and loss of jobs, Daniel Kerner, head of Latin America research at Eurasia Group. The success of that strategy may be decided by a debate on Nov. 15. After withdrawing from a debate before the first round, Scioli has agreed to go head-to-head with Macri. \u201cThere\u2019s still nearly two and a half weeks left - that\u2019s a long time in Argentine politics,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Roca said. \u201cThe result isn\u2019t yet decided.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/charliedevereux', 'name': u'Charlie Devereux', 'twitterhandle': u'charliedevereux'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-05/victory-for-argentina-s-macri-not-a-given-goldman-sachs-says', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 5, 11, 25, 21, 359000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Victory for Argentina's Macri Not a Given, Goldman Sachs Says"}, {'articleText': u'  The Netherlands, birthplace of the world\u2019s first stock exchange and the pioneering Dutch East India Company, is now home to banks with an unusually open mind about bitcoin. While big banks in China and the U.S. are reluctant to do business with ventures focused on virtual currency, Dutch banks are embracing them as potential customers. National regulators aren\u2019t cracking down as they are in other nations and major bitcoin startups are setting up shop in Amsterdam. Alert to the possibility that bitcoin might simply be a modern version of another historic Dutch moment -- the 17th-century bubble in tulip bulb prices -- bankers also say they are following the lead of new clients. Customers want change, and that change could be bitcoin, said Mark Buitenhek, ING Groep NV\u2019s global head of transaction services. \u201cWe are very expressly looking at what it is, what it can do and, mostly, what the message behind it is,\u201d Buitenhek said at a recent conference. \u201cAnd that tells us: Banks, take action.\u201d The Dutch financial industry\u2019s relative respect for bitcoin -- ING is the Netherlands\u2019 largest bank by total assets  -- contrasts with the U.S. and China, where skepticism about viability and potential misuse for money laundering has made business more difficult for bitcoin startups. Dutch regulators have warned about the risks of trading bitcoins, which surged in price from less than $13 at the start of last year to more than $1,000 before sliding to about $574 currently. Yet the authorities also have scrutinized bitcoin for its potential, said Jeroen Blokland, a Rotterdam-based strategist at Robeco, an asset manager. \u201cThey are willing to let this technological experiment unfold,\u201d he said in an interview. At the same time, authorities are warning anyone who wants to use it as an investment to \u201cbe careful, be very careful.\u201d Some bitcoin businesses have chosen Amsterdam over Europe\u2019s more traditional tech hot spot of London to base their European operations. Atlanta-based BitPay, a payment processor for merchants accepting bitcoins, opened an office in the Netherlands. BitFury, a startup that manufactures equipment for the bitcoin network, plans to base major operations there too. The Netherlands\u2019 benign environment for bitcoin doesn\u2019t stem from its potential as a currency that Dutch citizens might use to buy their bitterballen, a sort of deep-fried meatball that is a national dish. Instead, bankers and regulators are curious about its potential as a payment system. The bitcoin software protocol uses a public ledger distributed among many computers, known as the blockchain, to verify transactions in the digital currency and ensure that the same virtual coins are not spent twice. The system, first described five years ago by an anonymous programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto, allows for lower transaction costs than those involving a financial institution like Western Union Co. or Visa Inc., which charge for functioning as the trusted third party between people making and receiving payments. When it comes to bitcoin, the Netherlands shows big numbers for its size. It is home to about 5 percent of the bitcoin \u201cnodes\u201d -- a source of computing power for the network that authenticates transactions. That is not far off the rates for Germany, Britain, Canada and France, and more than China, home to more than a billion people. The original bitcoin client software, which lets users conduct transactions, has been downloaded in the Netherlands nearly 130,000 times, one of the highest rates in the world on a per-capita basis. Kim Gunnink, a policy officer for innovation and cybersecurity at the Dutch central bank, said the regulator believes companies could stand to \u201clearn something from virtual currencies\u201d such as bitcoin-based products that might improve customer service. \u201cTechnological innovations in the financial industry and in payment traffic can entail huge opportunities and large benefits for society,\u201d Gunnink said. In an official statement on virtual currencies on May 8, the central bank downplayed the notion that bitcoins could replace or even challenge the country\u2019s legal tender, the euro, and cited repeated thefts of bitcoins as a serious risk to consumers. At the same time, neither the central bank nor any other official body has required any bitcoin-related businesses to obtain a license or face any type of official scrutiny. The willingness of banks to participate in the bitcoin experiment allowed Jouke Hofman and two friends to found Bitonic in Baarn, southeast of Amsterdam, an exchange for obtaining and selling the digital currency, in 2012. Early on, Hofman forged and sustained relationships with ING and ABN Amro Group NV, the third-biggest Dutch bank. \u201cWe spend two man-days a week convincing the banks not to kick us out,\u201d Hofman said. \u201cIt was a struggle to get there.\u201d The refusal of banks to give bitcoin businesses access to the existing payment system is one reason some companies have been shuttered or unable to get off the ground in the U.S. The collapse of an exchange in Japan, Mt. Gox, and the use of bitcoins for illicit purposes, notably on the alleged drug bazaar Silk Road, has made banks wary of becoming unwitting parties to money laundering or consumer fraud. ABN Amro, by contrast, decided to take the risk, said Paul Iske, head of the bank\u2019s innovation center. Iske said virtual currencies are \u201cto some extent a Black Swan,\u201d using a term popularized by the author and investor Nassim Taleb to denote unexpected events with transformational effects. Companies experimenting with bitcoin deserve a chance, Iske said. \u201cWe\u2019re not excluding them,\u201d and the bank will assess each proposition separately, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of bank we want to be.\u201d Still, Iske stresses that bitcoin enthusiasts face some resistance even in the Netherlands. The country is already part of a European payment system, and banks power a popular and cheap online direct-debiting system. ING\u2019s Buitenhek said that the low cost of information technology means that trying a new infrastructure for payments is easier than it has been in the past. And the openness of the Dutch to new ideas in payment systems means the digital currency experiment will be allowed to run its course. \u201cThe Netherlands is among the absolute front runners,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we will be and remain pioneers, just as bitcoin is rising very rapidly here compared to other countries.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-29/bitcoin-grabs-dutch-fancy-as-bankers-mull-new-technolgy', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 5, 29, 4, 1, 0, 4000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Grabs Dutch Fancy as Bankers Mull New Technology'}, {'articleText': u'  Drug sales from the illicit Silk Road online emporium were linked to six overdose deaths by U.S. prosecutors seeking to send the site\u2019s founder to prison. The U.S. plans to have parents of two of the individuals, who allegedly overdosed on drugs bought through Silk Road, speak at the sentencing of Ross Ulbricht, the site\u2019s founder, his lawyers said in a court filing. Ulbricht, who faces life in prison for running the underground Internet emporium catering to criminals, wants to delay the sentencing until June to counter the new claims. The sentencing is currently set for May 15. The defense needs an extra month to prepare travel and appearances by experts and other potential witnesses, who will try to show the deaths aren\u2019t directly linked to Silk Road, the lawyers said Friday in a filing in Manhattan federal court.

The licensing inquiries came after the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said in March that companies that trade virtual currencies including Bitcoin are considered money transmitters for the purpose of complying with anti-money-laundering rules. Money transmitters, which include Western Union Co. and MoneyGram International Inc., require licenses in most states. \u201cWe are looking at one application in our state,\u201d Cotney said at a briefing in Washington organized by the Conference of State Banking Supervisors. \u201cOther states are looking at similar numbers.\u201d Shane Deal, deputy commissioner of financial institutions at the Minnesota Department of Commerce, said his agency has fielded \u201clots of inquiries\u201d about virtual currencies, but that he has no sense of what kinds of companies will seek licenses. \u201cWe know it\u2019s coming, we just don\u2019t know what,\u201d Deal said. Introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the most prominent of a group of virtual currencies -- money that exists mainly as a string of code -- that have no central issuing authority. Even with its unclear status, Bitcoin can be used to pay for T-shirts, food or an appointment with a Manhattan psychiatrist. Cotney said state regulators aren\u2019t insisting that virtual currency businesses take any specific form. Some existing money transmitters are \u201cmom and pop\u201d businesses while others are giants like Western Union. Still others are all online and have no physical presence in his state. \u201cThere are many models out there,\u201d Cotney said. New York\u2019s superintendent of financial services, Benjamin Lawsky, said on Nov. 14 that he would hold a hearing to consider, among other issues, creating a \u201cBitLicense\u201d for which virtual currency companies could apply. Lawsky has also subpoenaed 22 Bitcoin-related companies for information about how the industry could monitor transactions. The state bank supervisors group is forming a working group for 2014 on payment systems issues, said Charles Vice, the commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions.

Ross William Ulbricht, who runs the \u201cSilk Road Hidden Website\u201d was charged in federal court in New York today for running a \u201csprawling black-market bazaar\u201d where anonymous users conducted transactions with Bitcoins. Bitcoins exist as software that\u2019s designed to be untraceable, making it an attractive tender for those seeking to trade anonymously via the Web. The price for one unit dropped today to about $85 from $127. That\u2019s probably due to speculation that demand for the digital money will shrink after the U.S. government said it seized the Silk Road website, according to Jered Kenna, Chief Executive Officer of virtual-currency exchange Tradehill Inc. \u201cThe question here is: What is it going to do to the Bitcoin ecosystem?\u201d Kenna said in an interview. \u201cAre we going to find out that 90 percent of Bitcoins were used on Silk Road, or that 1 percent of Bitcoins were used there? The Silk Road just threw a lot of uncertainty into it.\u201d U.S. prosecutors said today that Ulbricht, known on Silk Road as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d ran the site as \u201cthe most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet\u201d from January 2011 to September 2013. The site generated sales of about $1.2 billion and about $80 million in commissions for Silk Road, they said. Since being introduced four years ago by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become popular way to pay for goods and services on the Internet, with 11.8 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks the digital currency\u2019s activity. While Bitcoins are designed to be untraceable, that\u2019s not always guaranteed since most transactions leave a record of the exchange. Although the currency can be used for illicit goods, it\u2019s also becoming a popular way to buy and sell legitimate products and services, from cupcakes to Web hosting. Bitstamp and several other online exchanges have emerged where Bitcoin holders are able to trade the digital currency for dollars, euros and other legal tender. With the growing use of Bitcoins, driven in part by speculative demand, the currency is up about tenfold over the last year, according to Bitcoincharts. Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, said that any regulation of the nascent Bitcoin industry has to include transparency on who does the trading of the virtual currency. He said in an interview with Bloomberg editors and reporters that his primary concern involved adding anti-money-laundering safeguards. Ulbricht, 29, was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. He tried to have one user killed for attempting to extort money from the site, prosecutors said in a criminal complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court. \u201cThe site has sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the Internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites,\u201d the government said in a civil forfeiture complaint unsealed today.

About a half-dozen of the wealthiest participants, including Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest person, and Irish telecommunications mogul Denis O\u2019Brien, said stocks will rise, interest rates will remain low and they\u2019d avoid investing in the virtual currency Bitcoin in 2014. \u201cThe bull market will continue, we\u2019ve actually turned the corner,\u201d Dangote said in an interview at the forum\u2019s Congress Centre last night. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to be a whole new ballgame. Things are improving in all sectors: in banking, in vehicle manufacturing, almost all the sectors. And I think we\u2019ve left the bad past behind.\u201d Dangote is one of at least 80 billionaires joining more than 2,500 business and political leaders in Davos this week, according to a list of attendees and promotional materials obtained by Bloomberg News. As billionaires bet on accelerating growth and rising asset prices, income inequality is emerging as a key theme for this week\u2019s annual meeting. A study released last week by the forum identified the income gap as the most probable menace to the global economy during the next decade. Wealth disparity -- driven by globalization and the recent financial crisis -- threatens to breed poverty and social disorder, it said. The wealthiest people on the planet got even richer last year, adding $524 billion to their collective net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the world\u2019s 300 wealthiest individuals. The aggregate net worth of the world\u2019s top billionaires stood at $3.6 trillion at the market close yesterday, according to the ranking. A study by UBS AG economist Paul Donovan last month found that pretax income of the top one percent of Americans amounts to about 20 percent of all U.S. income, which is comparable with levels in the early 20th century. Using Gini coefficients to measure income inequality, Donovan found those for the U.S., U.K., Japan, France and Canada have each risen since 2005. Bill Gates, the founder and chairman of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft Corp., was last year\u2019s biggest gainer. The 58-year-old tycoon\u2019s fortune increased by $15.8 billion to $78.5 billion, and recaptured the title of world\u2019s richest person last May from Mexican investor Carlos Slim. Bridgitt Arnold, a spokeswoman for Gates, said he declined to participate in the Bloomberg survey. \u201cPeople should feel great about the arrow of time but feel bad that we\u2019re not doing more,\u201d Gates said yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Betty Liu. \u201cHeadlines in a way are what mislead you because bad news is a headline and gradual improvement is not.\u201d Denis O\u2019Brien, the chairman of Hamilton, Bermuda-based Digicel Group Ltd., the largest telecommunications company in the Caribbean, said he was bullish on equities. \u201cI\u2019m going to stick with global telecom stocks,\u201d the 55-year-old billionaire said in an e-mail. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable that the equity markets will continue to be better over time with increasing value and dividends.\u201d O\u2019Brien has attended Davos for more than a decade and flew in last year on his Gulfstream 550 jet plane for the event\u2019s penultimate day. He said if he had $100 million to invest, he would bet $40 million on Vodafone Group Plc, $20 million in Bharti Airtel Ltd., $20 million in SoftBank Corp, and $20 million in Bangkok-based Advanced Info Service Pcl. \u201cI am positive about 2014, but it will not be like 2013 in terms of S&P 500 index gains,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stock market will be up due to better global earnings and consumers doing better. Consumers are recovering their appetite for goods, as they are only now emerging from their version of the debt crisis.\u201d O\u2019Brien said the biggest hurdle facing the global economy are politicians. \u201cThey are more and more worried about their re-election than growing their economies,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, certain European Banks still have issues particularly in the Benelux region, Spain, Italy, France and Germany. It will take many more years to sort them out.\u201d Vladimir Evtushenkov, the founder and largest shareholder of Moscow-based investment company AFK Sistema, said he wasn\u2019t sure if stocks would rise this year. \u201cFor many stocks in general and for AFK Sistema, particularly, 2013 was not a bad year, I am very cautious about their short-term growth prospects,\u201d he said in an e-mail. Evtushenkov, who\u2019s the world\u2019s 132nd-richest person, according to the Bloomberg ranking, said he would prefer to invest in new companies in sectors that are not affected by changes in central bank policies. The 65-year-old billionaire, whose publicly traded company maintains interests in OAO Mobile TeleSystems, Russia\u2019s biggest mobile-phone operator, and OAO Bashneft, an oil production and refining company, said the biggest risk to the world\u2019s economy are anti-global attitudes. \u201cThe opponents of globalization are becoming stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many countries, we see the growth of nationalist sentiments, which causes serious damage to the sustainable development of the whole world\u2019s economy.\u201d Enrique Razon, a casino and cargo terminal billionaire who doesn\u2019t gamble and says he feels more comfortable operating a port crane than he does glad-handing a crowd of high-rollers, said he\u2019d invest $100 million in Nigerian companies instead of stocks, Picasso paintings or Bitcoins. \u201cI believe there will be a correction coming\u201d in the stock market, he said in an e-mail. \u201cI\u2019m not certain if this will happen in 2014.\u201d The Filipino billionaire funneled $200 million of his own money into the Solaire Resort & Casino, a $1.2 billion gambling complex with 1,200 slot machines and 300 gaming tables that opened last March. He also owns half of International Container Terminal Services Inc., a port operator with facilities stretching from Brazil to Madagascar to India, which he inherited when his father died in 1995. The billionaire said the biggest challenge facing the global economy is \u201cliquidity,\u201d and that central banks will not be able to keep interest rates at their low rates for the year. \u201cI hope to network and update myself on regional and global issues,\u201d he said of his second time at the WEF annual meeting. Billionaire Adi Godrej, 71, agreed interest rates would rise \u201csomewhat in the developed world,\u201d though he expects them to \u201ccome down in the developing world.\u201d Godrej, who has visited Davos for more than 20 years, forecast that the bull market in stocks would continue. His family\u2019s holdings, which include real estate and consumer goods, had revenue of $4.1 billion in the year ended March 2013 and are used by more than half a billion Indians every day. His cousin, Jamshyd Godrej, crossed paths with Bajaj Auto Ltd. chairman Rahul Bajaj at last year\u2019s meeting, one of many meetings among the 17 Indian billionaires in attendance, topped only by the U.S. contingent last year. Nineteen Indian billionaires are expected at the gathering in 2014. The 75-year-old Bajaj won\u2019t be among them. After coming to Davos for 35 years, he said in an e-mail to Bloomberg News that he won\u2019t be making the trip this week. \u201cI see the bull market continuing,\u201d billionaire Malvinder Singh, executive chairman of New Delhi-based Fortis Healthcare Ltd., India\u2019s second-biggest hospital operator, said in an e-mail. \u201cInterest rates will continue to remain low through 2014 as economies work out ways of kick-starting recovery by boosting demand.\u201d The 41-year-old, who has been coming to Davos for more than a decade, said he attends the WEF \u201cto interact with some of the finest minds from around the world and get a great sense as to what is on top of their minds.\u201d Agustin Coppel Luken, the chairman and CEO of closely held Coppel SA, Mexico\u2019s fifth-largest retailer, said the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index would \u201cremain in good shape.\u201d \u201cEverything indicates that international interest rates will remain at a low level,\u201d he said in an e-mail. \u201cIf the economy continues growing, companies will have the proper conditions for good results.\u201d Coppel splits a fortune valued at more than $17 billion, according to the Bloomberg ranking, with his four brothers, Enrique, Ruben, Alberto and Jose. The siblings also have interests in a bank, a retirement-fund manager and real estate. Their department store chain has 1,000 stores across Mexico offering appliances, clothing, perfumes and electronics to low-income consumers. The billionaire, who is coming to Davos for the fifth time, said the biggest hurdle facing the global economy are U.S. politicans. \u201cUndoubtedly, the main hurdle is the Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\xb4s irresponsible to run a government with such deficit and high level of public debt. A change is urgently needed.\u201d Torbjorn Tornqvist, chief executive officer of oil trader Gunvor Group Ltd., said he would continue to invest in stocks in 2014, targeting underperforming sectors, such as natural resources. \u201cThe oil and mining sectors have been very weak,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer to invest when market expectations are low, because when these opportunities turn, they turn quickly.\u201d The Swede founded Gunvor in 2000 with fellow billionaire Gennady Timchenko. The company is the fifth-largest independent commodity trader based on its full-year 2012 revenue of $93 billion. For Tornqvist, China poses the biggest risk to the global economy in 2014. \u201cChina is the big question,\u201d he said. \u201cWill it perform as expected? Growth rates could be lower than generally anticipated due to credit and debt issues, which could have wider consequences for the Asia region.\u201d Like Singh, he said he expects the forum will spark new investment ideas. \u201cI go to Davos to get some distance from my own business and hopefully come away with some new ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cDavos provides a good stimulus for visionary and strategic thinking.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-21/davos-billionaires-see-wealth-gains-on-2014-stocks-rally', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 22, 17, 29, 41, 325000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Davos Billionaires See Wealth Gains on 2014 Stocks Rally'}, {'articleText': u'  Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchange, was sued for fraud by a U.S. customer within hours of filing bankruptcy. Mt. Gox, which started as a marketplace for illustrated trading cards used to play the game Magic: The Gathering, is under investigation by prosecutors and regulators examining the use of the digital currency. The exchange said Feb. 24 it had lost 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to users and 100,000 more of its own. The exchange filed for bankruptcy yesterday in Tokyo. It said in a statement that its debt exceeded its assets by 2.7 billion yen ($26.4 million). \u201cThis catastrophic loss has not only revealed the instability of a burgeoning new industry, it has also uncovered a massive scheme to defraud millions of consumers into providing a private company with real, paper money in exchange for virtual currency,\u201d Illinois resident Gregory Greene said in a Feb. 27 complaint in federal court in Chicago that may be the first lawsuit against Mt. Gox. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by one or more programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has since gained traction with merchants around the world. The virtual coin has no central issuing authority and uses a public ledger to verify transactions while preserving users\u2019 anonymity. After Mt. Gox went off-line this month, U.S. and Japanese prosecutors opened investigations into the company while U.S. regulators explore ways to increase oversight of virtual currencies. The European Banking Authority said yesterday it would create a task force to review ways to regulate Bitcoin and its derivatives. Bitcoin fell 5.6 percent yesterday and was valued at $551.67 at 10:40 p.m. New York time yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Bitcoins Stolen? \u201cThere is a high possibility that the Bitcoins were stolen,\u201d Mt. Gox said in a statement when it filed for bankruptcy. \u201cIt is considering filing a criminal complaint.\u201d In Florida, lawyers for two men accused of using Bitcoins in an alleged money-laundering scheme told a judge on Feb. 27 that they did nothing illegal because the state\u2019s law covers only currency issued by the U.S. or another country. \u201cNo one ever anticipated there would be a non-government form of currency, but there is,\u201d a defense lawyer, Ron Lowy, said after the hearing. In Chicago, Greene\u2019s lawsuit seeks class-action, or group, status on behalf of all people in the U.S. who paid Mt. Gox to buy, sell or trade in Bitcoins as well as those who had currency stored with the Japanese entity on Feb. 7. Along with damages, Greene is seeking a court order creating a trust to oversee the company\u2019s business. \u201cAs a result of Mt. Gox \u2018going dark\u2019 and shutting down its entire operation, users\u2019 fiat currency\u201d -- that is, money issued by national governments -- \u201cand Bitcoins previously stored by Mt. Gox are now unavailable to them, and by all accounts, have been converted and captured by Mt. Gox,\u201d according to the complaint. The suit names as defendants Tokyo-based Tibanne KK and its units Mt. Gox KK and Mt. Gox Inc., a U.S.-incorporated company, and Mark Karpeles, chief executive officer of all three, according to the complaint. Reflecting it\u2019s start as a trading card marketplace, the company\u2019s name is an acronym for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange. Karpeles didn\u2019t respond yesterday to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. This week, he resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the currency. The foundation is aiding the U.S. probe. Greene\u2019s attorney, Jay Edelson of Chicago, said in a phone interview yesterday he was aware that a foreign company in bankruptcy may ask a U.S. court to block litigation during its reorganization. \u201cObviously it\u2019s going to be a big issue,\u201d he said, adding that Mt. Gox Inc. and Karpeles aren\u2019t in bankruptcy and that the Japanese entity\u2019s filing wouldn\u2019t shield them. Edelson said his client\u2019s fraud claims may be \u201cseparated from the bankruptcy proceeding and we\u2019ll be able to pursue them.\u201d He said there could be hundreds of thousands of claimants. Chapter 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy allows companies to seek protection from creditors in the U.S. while the primary case proceeds in another country. Edelson said he plans to file papers next week seeking to force Mt. Gox to say whether it has client money and how much, and to release it. He said his client was seeking recovery in U.S. dollars, which is \u201cthe traditional currency of the U.S. courts,\u201d and not in Bitcoins. The case is Greene v. Mt.

Gox Inc., the American affiliate of the bankrupt Bitcoin exchange that lost track of hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of virtual currency, had its U.S. assets frozen by a federal judge in Chicago. U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman today issued a temporary order tying up money and property belonging to the affiliate, its ultimate corporate parent, Tibanne KK, and principal Mark Karpeles after a hearing today. He issued that order without opposition from the frozen entities, who weren\u2019t represented in court, and in the presence of lawyers for the parent, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox Co., which filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month. Feinerman\u2019s order doesn\u2019t cover the bankrupt entity and expires on March 25. Once the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox Co. said in a U.S. court filing that almost 750,000 customer Bitcoins and 100,000 of its own, about 7 percent of all Bitcoins in existence worldwide, were missing and probably stolen. Almost at the same time it was filing for bankruptcy in Tokyo last month, the company, its affiliates and Karpeles were being sued in the U.S. by Gregory Greene of Skokie, Illinois, a depositor claiming he had lost access to about $25,000 worth of currency. Suing on behalf of the businesses\u2019 U.S. customers, he accused the companies and Karpeles of misappropriation and fraud. Mt. Gox Co. has also sought protection from creditors in the U.S., and yesterday obtained an order from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas shielding it from litigation. Hale declined to extend that protection to the other defendants sued by Greene, which Feinerman took into account today when he approved the asset freeze. Citing what he called a \u201cvery limited record,\u201d Feinerman said Greene established a \u201csufficient likelihood of success\u201d on his claims to warrant the freeze. \u201cIt may turn out there are no such assets,\u201d Feinerman said. The judge also said his findings in support of the injunction could change as the case before him goes forward. John Murphy, an attorney for Mt. Gox Co. who was present at the Chicago hearing, declined to comment afterward. One of Greene\u2019s attorneys, Steven Woodrow, told the judge he thought the U.S. government had obtained a court order tying up between $2.1 million and $5 million in assets controlled by Karpeles in the U.S. After the hearing, lead plaintiff\u2019s lawyer Jay Edelson said he plans to immediately question Karpeles under oath. \u201cWe can finally get some real answers,\u201d Edelson said. Feinerman set a status conference for March 20. Hale scheduled an April 1 hearing in Dallas to determine whether Mt.

Coinbase Inc., a provider of online Bitcoin accounts, raised $25 million earlier this month in funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, while Gliph Inc. and BitPay Inc. have reeled in financing from other investors. Coinsetter, based in New York, said on its website that it\u2019s \u201cdedicated to making Bitcoin safe and easy to use for all.\u201d The service, which is currently open only to friends and family, aggregates Bitcoin prices from multiple exchanges, offers charting tools for market analysis and provides a trading system.

Bitcoins, introduced in 2008, topped $1,000 earlier this year, up from about $12 a year ago, and have since fallen to $716.12, according to Bitstamp, an exchange where the digital money is traded for dollars and other currencies. The virtual currency isn\u2019t controlled by any government or central bank and exists as software that can be used to pay for everything from candy to consulting services online.

A ban would be a \u201ccolossal step backward,\u201d said Gref, who was economy minister during President Vladimir Putin\u2019s first two terms. Gref, who\u2019s run state-run Sberbank, eastern Europe\u2019s largest lender, since 2007, said he\u2019d sent letters to the Kremlin, central bank and Finance Ministry asking officials to intervene with parliament to avert possible restrictions. That runs counter to the views of many of his western counterparts, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who told CNBC in Davos that governments will eventually get \u201creally upset\u201d with Bitcoin and force it to become just a payment system regulated like all others. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer, or group of programmers, known as Satoshi Nakamoto. There are 21\xa0million possible Bitcoins that can be mined by a peer-to-peer network harnessing computers to complete complicated mathematical calculations. About 12.2 million units are currently in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts.com. Enthusiasts say they are building a system to move money across the Internet securely and at a lower cost than existing wire transfers, bank debits or remittances -- sources of billions of dollars in fees for banks such as JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. The price of Bitcoins soared in November, topping $1,000 for the first time, as speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. The price has since dropped to about $790 on Bitstamp, one of the more active online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars and other currencies. One Bitcoin cost about $15 a year ago. \u201cIt definitely shouldn\u2019t be banned, it must be studied and maybe regulated properly,\u201d Gref said today. Andrei Kostin, chief executive officer of VTB Group, Russia\u2019s second-largest lender, said he\u2019s much more wary of virtual currencies. \u201cThey\u2019re quite dangerous for the money market and therefore we have no plans to get involved,\u201d Kostin said in an interview in Davos yesterday. \u201cOur monetary authorities are only now formulating their opinion about this.\u201d The U.S. government is still studying the Bitcoin \u201cphenomenon\u201d to ensure the digital currency isn\u2019t used for unlawful purposes, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in an interview with CNBC in Davos. \u201cIt is an anonymous form of transaction and it offers places for people to hide,\u201d Lew said. The security committee in Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, approved a draft bill on Jan. 15 that seeks to curb anonymous transactions as a means to counter terrorism. It\u2019s not clear how Russia will be able to regulate virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, though, since they don\u2019t have issuance or processing centers, according to Viktor Dostov, president of the Russian Electronic Money Association. The only \u201ccontrol point\u201d is an exchange center where Bitcoins can be sold for real money, Dostov said by phone from Moscow. \u201cIt\u2019s a gray zone,\u201d Russian Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev said in an interview in Davos on Jan. 22. \u201cWe know regulators in some countries such as China and Japan are implementing restrictions. We\u2019ll monitor that carefully.\u201d Lawmaker Shamsail Saraliev of the pro-Putin United Russia party, who co-wrote the bill, said the law would counter terrorism, the illicit drug trade and contract killings. \u201cThe topic is very specific and many issues in the draft are new and require revisions to settle all the technical details,\u201d Saraliev said by e-mail, without elaborating. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, declined to comment on the draft law immediately.

A denial-of-service attack, in which a website is flooded with massive requests for data, obstructed Bitstamp\u2019s ability to check account balances, the exchange said in a statement. Customers can withdraw cash but not Bitcoins, as the company works to fix services, Nejc Kodric, Bitstamp\u2019s chief executive officer, wrote in an e-mail. The value of Bitcoin, which can be used to buy everything from Tesla Motors Inc. cars to Gummi bears, was down 1.2 percent at $661.17 at 1:15 p.m. in New York today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages exchange prices. Mt.Gox, another major online exchange, restored cash withdrawals on Feb. 10 after suspending services last week because of a technical flaw in how service providers reconcile Bitcoin transactions. \u201cWe already established working Bitcoin deposits, meaning that our client can deposit Bitcoins, sell them and withdraw fiat currency without any problems,\u201d Kodric wrote. No funds were lost and transactions that failed on Feb. 10 and 11 will be canceled, Bitstamp said. \u201cThis is a nuisance attack,\u201d said Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer for Blockchain.info, a provider of online wallets for a digital currencies. \u201cFunds have not been lost, and have not been affected. What it\u2019s done is slow down their accounting system from reconciling transactions.\u201d Bitcoins can be used to buy goods and services on Web stores and retail outlets. Non-profit thrift store operator Goodwill will be able to offer the option for stores to accept Bitcoins in some locations via payment terminals from Revel Systems Inc., the company said yesterday. The governments of India, China and Russia have sought to ban or limit the use of Bitcoins, which exist as software and aren\u2019t controlled by any central authority. Some U.S.-based exchanges have either closed at the behest of law enforcement or had difficulties obtaining business bank accounts due to regulatory concerns. The latest attack exploits a design element of Bitcoin, which exists as software. Since transactions need to be tracked and reconciled within the currency itself, any data disruption makes it difficult for exchanges and other service providers to follow the flow of the digital money. Coinbase Inc., a Bitcoin wallet operator, said that customers can still send and receive funds, although the attack, which affects the Bitcoin ecosystem as whole, is causing some delays in transactions. BTC-e, another Bitcoin exchange, said in a series of tweets that it was experiencing delays. Transactions that were affected by the denial-of-service attack will be reprocessed, it said. Some websites, as well as users of Bitcoin wallet software, will have to update their programs with fixes to prevent future attacks, according to Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin software developer. \u201cEven the designer of the system and other developers were unaware of how the system could be changed,\u201d Garzik said in an interview. \u201cAll of the wallets will need some level of updates.\u201d The denial-of-service attack against Bitstamp was small, and probably originated from one rogue computer, Garzik said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-12/bitcoin-exchange-bitstamp-halts-customer-withdrawals', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 12, 20, 38, 51, 39000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Exchange Bitstamp Halts Customer Withdrawals'}, {'articleText': u'  What do a street-van burger, a wedding bouquet and a Beatles album have in common? They\u2019re all on a growing list of products shoppers can buy over the counter using the virtual currency Bitcoin. From Berlin record store Long Player to the Flower Lab, a florist in Santa Monica, California, more retailers are accepting Bitcoin as consumers increasingly buy into the money, pushing up its value. In the past month, the number of businesses on CoinMap, a website showing physical companies and vendors accepting Bitcoin, has tripled to more than 2,100. \u201cPeople come to us from all over the world because we accept Bitcoin,\u201d Vesna Sic, co-owner of the Lekkerurlaub guest house in Berlin, said by phone. \u201cWe had one man from Texas who has nowhere at home where he can spend his Bitcoins, so he came to Berlin for a week to spend them.\u201d There are about 12.2 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts. While online payments for everything from university tuition fees to gummi bears aren\u2019t unusual, over-the-counter transactions are just beginning to become popular. Now the virtual currency can buy olive oil in Spain or vodka shots in Moscow as consumers seek ways to spend the digital money. \u201cOur news inbox has gone crazy over the last couple of months with more and more vendors saying they are accepting Bitcoins,\u201d said Jeremy Bonney, a project manager at CoinDesk, a website that tracks the progress of the virtual currency. Bitcoin exists as software and isn\u2019t controlled by any government or central bank. The cryptocurrency emerged in 2008, proposed by a programmer or group whose identity is unknown. While a handful of companies have minted physical Bitcoins with a code that can be scanned to link them to the digital version, they\u2019re rarely used for everyday purchases since they\u2019re worth hundreds of dollars apiece. Today, a Bitcoin fetched $757, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin price index. There are 26 physical retailers in London that accept Bitcoin and about 160 in Britain, according to CoinMap. Government and banking restrictions prevent U.K. retailers from adopting Bitcoins on a larger scale, said Chris Skinner, director of the Financial Services Club and head of Balatro Ltd., a research firm in London. While there are few limitations on individuals buying and selling, lenders may close the accounts of businesses conducting many transfers with the electronic currency. \u201cBanks are running scared of money-laundering regulations and Bitcoin is primarily associated in the government\u2019s mind with avoidance of tax and potentially fueling and funding terrorism and drug running,\u201d Skinner said. The European Banking Authority is weighing whether to regulate virtual currencies, a decision that could make or break wider-scale use by retailers. The banking regulator warned Dec. 13 that users risk theft and lack protection from losses if their virtual exchange collapses. Bitcoin\u2019s value has been known to lose or gain more than a quarter of its value in a single day. A decision by China\u2019s central bank to bar financial institutions from handling transactions of the currency earlier this month sent the value tumbling. \u201cToday the exchange rate is a third of what it was last week,\u201d London street vendor Tom Reaney said on Dec. 11. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant gamble unless you cash them in at the right time, but then where\u2019s the fun in cashing them in because then you don\u2019t have any coins?\u201d Late last month, Reaney\u2019s Burger Bear became London\u2019s first street food vendor to accept Bitcoin. Within three weeks about 50 customers had used the currency, paying him by making a transfer with their smartphones. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting all the fuss when I said I would accept Bitcoin, but a lot of people have jumped on it,\u201d Reaney said. \u201cPeople are desperate to spend their coins on something rather than just online transactions.\u201d Reaney often parks his van near the so-called Silicon Roundabout, an area of East London with many tech startups. He decided to start accepting Bitcoin after noticing that customers were users. One of his first virtual-currency clients, Web developer Ryan Holder, said he bought his first Bitcoins in April and has since seen them more than quadruple in value. \u201cI wanted to start moving a larger and larger proportion of my free cash every month into Bitcoin,\u201d Holder said. \u201cThat was what inspired me to search for some food that I could buy because it\u2019s all well and good having currency, but if you can\u2019t eat with the currency then you\u2019re in trouble really, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Holder bought many Christmas presents at online Bitcoin stores this year, including a remote-controlled quadcopter for his son. Stephen Early, the owner of the Pembury Tavern, the first London pub to accept Bitcoin for beer, says it\u2019s an attractive form of payment for small retailers because, unlike credit cards, it has no transaction fees and payments can be processed in less than a minute. \u201cI was fed up with the credit card process so it\u2019s been nice to use Bitcoin,\u201d Early said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not yet confident enough to put all my savings into it, even though if I had done so earlier this year, I would now be very rich.\u201d  Download: Woo Says Bitcoin Can Be Major Tool for E-Commerce   Download:  ', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-30/bitcoin-buys-burgers-to-beer-as-shoppers-go-virtual', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 30, 12, 14, 21, 564000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Buys Burgers to Beer as Shoppers Go Virtual'}, {'articleText': u'      Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Some Americans think Bitcoin is an\nXbox game, others think it might be an iPhone app, majority have\nno idea it\u2019s a virtual currency they can use to buy everything\nfrom T-shirts to Tesla Motors sedans, according to a Bloomberg\nNational Poll.  * Only 42% of Americans who responded to the Dec. 6-9  telephone survey correctly identified Bitcoin, which has  gained more than 80-fold in value this year as its  popularity expands\n  * Asked to choose from a list, 6% of those polled say they  think Bitcoin is an Xbox game, while another 6% say it\u2019s an  iPhone app; 46% say they have no idea what it is\n  * Telephone survey of 1,004 Americans has margin of error of  plus or minus 3.1 percentage points and was conducted by Des  Moines, Iowa-based Selzer & Co.\n  * Introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers  under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin gained credibility  after law enforcement and securities agencies said in recent  U.S. Senate hearings that it could be a legitimate means of  exchange  For Related News and Information:\nBitcoin Can Be Major Tool for E-Commerce, Bank of America Says\nNSN MXD4PK6TTDST <GO>\nBitcoin Tops $1,000 as Virtual Money Gains Wider Acceptance\nNSN MWXRYO6S972N <GO>\n ', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-12/most-americans-don-t-know-bitcoin-while-some-guess-xbox', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 13, 1, 7, 29, 1000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Most Americans Don't Know Bitcoin While Some Guess Xbox"}, {'articleText': u'  Mt.

After about 20 minutes, Bloomberg News was connected to an operator who said there are more than 10 people fielding calls, and some are able to deal with English speakers. Mt.

The Winklevoss twins, who claimed Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social-networking website to start Facebook Inc., are seeking to open the first ETF tracking a virtual asset. More than 1,500 ETFs in the U.S. manage about $1.7 trillion, investing chiefly in stocks, bonds and commodities. Approval for a new type of ETF can involve several rounds of comments from regulators, and multiple resubmissions of the application, said Moriarty. The approval process for the Bitcoin ETF is \u201cprogressing nicely and might occur at the end of 2014,\u201d she said. The Winklevosses owned about $10 million in Bitcoins, or 1 percent of the outstanding amount, when they filed their initial application.

Created five years ago by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, the value of Bitcoins has varied. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index valued the currency yesterday at $837.51. Regulators and law-enforcement officials have expressed concern that virtual currencies could facilitate money laundering and sales of illegal goods.

Donations to the European anti-secrecy website initially surged after it offered financial support for Edward Snowden, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor who revealed secrets about American surveillance, the group\u2019s sponsor says. Contributions since have slid, according to the Hamburg-based Wau Holland Foundation, main collector of funds for WikiLeaks. Donations surged to 1,000 euros ($1,285) a day after Snowden stepped forward as the source of June newspaper reports about U.S. telephone and Internet surveillance, according to Bernd Fix, a spokesman for Wau Holland. Daily contributions have since dropped to about 100 euros ($128.50), or about three times the rate before Snowden\u2019s emergence, a level that is unlikely to put WikiLeaks in the black again after two years of deficits, Fix said in an e-mail. The group has dramatically cut expenses as contributions have dropped off, Kristinn Hrafnsson, a spokesman for WikiLeaks, said by telephone from Reykjavik. He said the organization should be able to survive at a lower level of activity. \u201cI\u2019m fairly optimistic we\u2019ll be able to raise enough funds to continue our work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have adapted to the situation and will carry on.\u201d The group, which published diplomatic and military documents obtained by U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning in 2010, thrust itself into the news again this year by offering legal and logistical help for Snowden. It put a chartered airplane on stand-by after Snowden, who had worked as a government contractor in Hawaii, surfaced in Hong Kong following newspaper reports of material he later acknowledged providing about surveillance. Olafur Vignir Sigurvinsson, an Iceland-based WikiLeaks representative who arranged the plane for Snowden, said by phone this week that the charter was made possible through outside funds from \u201cfriends,\u201d though Snowden eventually made it to Moscow on a regular OAO Aeroflot flight. WikiLeaks \u201cdid have a hand in financing\u201d the flight to Moscow, said Hrafnsson, declining to specify the cost. Sigurvinsson said there are \u201ccurrently\u201d no plans to fly Snowden from the international transit area of Moscow\u2019s airport, where he is seeking asylum in other countries. The U.S. has accused Snowden of espionage and theft and revoked his passport. WikiLeaks said yesterday on Twitter that Snowden had not \u201cformally\u201d accepted asylum in Venezuela, disputing earlier reports. The group said \u201cstates concerned will make the announcement if and when the appropriate time comes. The announcement will then be confirmed by us.\u201d WikiLeaks has 1.9 million followers on Twitter. WikiLeaks has been struggling with financing and relevance as founder Julian Assange is holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden. The group also lost more than $50 million of potential donations after Visa Europe, MasterCard Inc. and American Express Co. stopped payments to the WikiLeaks in 2010, according to Assange. Rebecca Kaufman, a spokeswoman at Mastercard, and Jennifer Doidge, a spokeswoman for Visa, didn\u2019t immediately respond to voicemails seeking comment. Visa and MasterCard, along with PayPal, Bank of America and Western Union had suspended processing payments for WikiLeaks when the site published classified documents leaked by Manning, who\u2019s currently on trial in the U.S. The blockade was lifted this year following a court battle by Reykjavik-based DataCell, which processes WikiLeaks payments. The Supreme Court of Iceland required the payment gateway opened, according to an agreement made with DataCell, Visa Europe said in a statement today, and Visa Europe hasn\u2019t sought to prevent compliance with that legal order. \u201cThe banking blockade has had a dramatic effect\u201d on WikiLeaks, Hrafnsson said. \u201cThe most serious aspect of the banking blockade is that it stripped us of the ability to expand and carry out the projects we had in mind.\u201d The group last year spent almost 400,000 euros after receiving just 69,000 euros in donations, according to the Wau Holland Foundation\u2019s annual report. While Wikileak\u2019s funding comes \u201cmostly from Wau Holland,\u201d Hrafnsson said, he couldn\u2019t immediately say how much comes from other sources. WikiLeaks can now process donations via MasterCard and Visa through a payment gateway in France, Hrafnsson said. The San Francisco-based Freedom of the Press Foundation is raising money online for WikiLeaks and other journalism organizations, according to executive director Trevor Timm. The foundation has taken in more than $300,000 since fundraising began in mid-December, with 40 percent going to WikiLeaks. The money for WikiLeaks goes to Wau Holland, he said. The press foundation also is raising money to hire court stenographers for Manning\u2019s military trial to make the proceedings available to the public, Timm said. Wau Holland reported collecting 1.5 million euros for WikiLeaks from 2010-12, according to its annual report. It raised 1.3 million euros in 2010, it reported, with collections declining to 69,000 euros in 2012. The foundation listed the main expenses for WikiLeaks as 178,000 euros stemming from \u201ccampaigns,\u201d or from content review, \u201cjournalist contextualization\u201d and external communications. It spent 134,000 euros on logistics, 37,000 euros on infrastructure and 18,000 euros on legal advice, according to Wau. \u201cDevelopment of donations over the past two years has declined substantially, and is currently no longer able to provide the earlier levels support for the project,\u201d Wau stated in the report. \u201cSince January 2013 the foundation has only been able to cover expenditures in essential infrastructure, such as servers.\u201d Wau Holland was set up in memory of Herwart \u201cWau\u201d Holland-Moritz, who founded the Chaos Computer Club in 1981 and died in 2001. The foundation\u2019s aim is to \u201cpromote and pursue his unique freethinking in relation to freedom of communication and informational self-determination,\u201d according to its website. WikiLeaks seeks donations of 10 euros to 250 euros ($13 to $319) on its website via credit card through a French bank, or through PayPal or with Bitcoins. It also gets money from crowd sourcing through the Freedom of the Press Foundation, asking for donations from $25 to $5,000. The foundation also raises money for the Center for Public Integrity. Hrafnsson declined to comment on how much funding WikiLeaks needs to keep up operations, which requires powerful computers and large amounts of data storage. He also said he doesn\u2019t have an immediate overview of the incoming cash. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about tens of thousands of donors, giving an average of 20 to 30 euros,\u201d he said. \u201cThe highest donation was 1,200 euros,\u201d he said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-09/wikileaks-leaking-cash-after-snowden-inspired-surge-slows', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 10, 15, 18, 46, 967000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'WikiLeaks Leaking Cash After Snowden-Inspired Surge Slows'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-10-05/prospects-for-bitcoin-in-china', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u'  Xapo Ltd., a provider of secure online storage for Bitcoins, has raised $20 million in a first round of funding led by venture capital firm Benchmark.

Casares started Xapo two years ago while he was the CEO of mobile-payments provider Lemon.com, which LifeLock Inc. bought in December for $50 million, Casares said. Palo Alto, California-based Xapo, which is insured by Meridian Insurance Group Inc., offers secure storage vaults for Bitcoins, as well as Web-based wallets for sending and receiving the virtual currency. At Mt. Gox, hackers stole 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own, for a total of 850,000, the company said. Xapo already has several thousand accounts, including holders of large Bitcoin deposits such as hedge funds, venture capital funds, sovereign wealth funds and family offices, said Casares, who declined to comment on their identity. \u201cWe have been talking to Wences about Bitcoin for quite a long time and we think Xapo offers a unique wallet-with-vault service which is secure offline and online and therefore compelling for institutional as well as retail investors,\u201d Matt Cohler, the partner who led Benchmark\u2019s investment in Xapo, said. Xapo is Benchmark\u2019s first public investment in a Bitcoin company. Cohler, a former Facebook Inc. executive, said he personally owns Bitcoins and stores them with Xapo. Casares, 40, was born to a family of sheep farmers in Argentina\u2019s Patagonia region. He and Micky Malka, Ribbit\u2019s founder, have started four financial-service companies together. Ribbit, one of the few venture-capital investors that also invests directly in Bitcoins, also stores its holdings with Xapo, Malka said. Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a London-based Bitcoin vault, debuted in January. James Smith, Elliptic\u2019s CEO, said he found an underwriter for insuring the company against any loss of Bitcoins via Lloyds of London Ltd. Smith declined to identify his underwriter. A Lloyds of London representative said their underwriters didn\u2019t insure Elliptic. While Smith had initially said Elliptic clients would be reimbursed in British pounds in the event of any loss, the company issued a statement yesterday after learning of Xapo to say that it will also compensate customers by purchasing Bitcoins at market rates using payouts in pounds.

Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Jernigan said today it appeared Karpeles, while seeking protection from creditors in the U.S., was trying to avoid being served with additional legal papers upon his arrival. She rejected Mt. Gox lawyers\u2019 offer to produce a representative to answer questions about the exchange without promising it would be Karpeles as well as a proposal he travel only as far as Taipei. \u201cI\u2019m going to order him to appear,\u201d Jernigan said. \u201cHe availed himself of this court.\u201d Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo on Feb. 28, after revealing earlier that month that almost 750,000 customer bitcoins and about 100,000 of its own were unaccounted for and possibly stolen. It later said about 200,000 of them had been located. Each unit of the virtual currency is worth about $479.40 today, according to the website CoinDesk, which tracks its value. At about the same time as the bankruptcy filing, the exchange, Karpeles and two related companies were sued for fraud in federal court in Chicago by U.S. depositor Gregory Greene. On March 9, Mt. Gox filed in Dallas for U.S. recognition of the bankruptcy proceeding in Japan. Attorneys in the Chicago lawsuit and an earlier case in Seattle sought to question Karpeles. Today, Jernigan prohibited those lines of questioning, limiting the subject of a deposition of Karpeles to matters concerning the U.S. bankruptcy, assets and creditors. Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, called the offer to produce Karpeles in Taipei \u201cunreasonable,\u201d telling the judge it made no sense to send several sets of lawyers there in lieu of flying Karpeles to the U.S. \u201cWe\u2019ve offered to pay his travel expenses,\u201d Woodrow said, adding the only person who could shed light on whether it was appropriate for Mt. Gox to be before a U.S. bankruptcy court is Karpeles. Jernigan ordered that Karpeles appear April 17 at the Dallas offices of Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy attorneys.

Japan became a focal point for the global dearth of Bitcoin regulation last week when Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange for the virtual currency, went bankrupt after coins valued at more than $500 million disappeared.

The DFS inquiry began earlier this year with letters from Lawsky\u2019s office to BitInstant and Dwolla seeking general information about the virtual currency industry, according to the person. The subpoenas sent last week reflect the department\u2019s interest in more granular detail. According to his statement, Lawsky is concerned with consumer complaints regarding how quickly virtual currency transactions are processed. The regulator, who threatened to pull the banking license of Standard Chartered Plc last August over violations of currency transfer sanctions against Iran, also expressed concern with criminal abuse of virtual currency markets. \u201cServing as a money changer of choice for terrorists, drug smugglers, illegal weapons dealers, money launderers and human traffickers could expose the virtual currency industry to extraordinarily serious criminal penalties,\u201d Lawsky said.

In a ruling that puts Bitcoin on a more equal footing with mainstream money, the EU Court of Justice sided with Swede David Hedqvist who set up a service for the exchange of mainstream money for bitcoin and vice versa. VAT, a type of sales tax, shouldn\u2019t be charged because the business involves \u201cthe exchange of different means of payment,\u201d the judges said. \u201cIt\u2019s very good news,\u201d\xa0said Simon Dixon, CEO of Bnktothefuture.com, a platform for investing in new, alternative financial products, including those based on Bitcoins. \u201cIf you were taxed on the exchange it would make it an inferior currency to other currencies, so the implications of it being treated as a currency are that it can free flow.\u201d Bitcoin currency, introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, has no central issuing authority and uses a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions. It has gained traction with merchants selling legitimate products but also has been used to facilitate illegal transactions because money can be transferred anonymously. Virtual currencies have faced increased scrutiny amid concern that their use may fall under the radar of financial watchdogs and law-enforcement. The European Banking Authority said last year that banks shouldn\u2019t buy, hold or sell virtual currencies until regulators develop safeguards to protect their integrity. \u201cI always felt like this was the only sensible decision,\u201d\xa0Hedqvist said after the ruling. \u201cIt is important for businesses all over Europe that they finally have clear guidance regarding VAT and for some this could mean that they will get money back from the tax office.\u201d The lack of clarification from the EU on how bitcoin should be treated for tax purposes has been \u201ca bit of a hindrance,\u201d said Dixon.

Instead of an updated Nexus 7 tablet or a new Chromebook model, Google spent three hours during Wednesday\u2019s keynote to discuss services and feature upgrades for both Chrome and Android. I do think that in the coming months we\u2019ll see improved Google devices, but that\u2019s not what this year\u2019s I/O event is all about. And even though I\u2019m a gadget guy, I can appreciate the message Google is sending this week. As I tweeted during our live blog, there was a very common theme throughout the keynote, and it had absolutely nothing to do with hardware. Any thoughts of Chrome merging with Android in the traditional sense can be dismissed based on what I heard at the keynote. Instead, the two distinct platforms are sharing services, APIs, and design cues. What does that mean? Whatever Google services you use on an Android phone or tablet can be used on a desktop or laptop in Chrome, for example. For the first time, Chrome as a browser is good enough to be the glue that ties user experiences together between mobile devices and traditional computers. How so? Take a look at the new Google+ stream. It appears more card-based\u2014akin to Google Now\u2014and looks the same whether you\u2019re viewing it in Chrome on a Windows PC or on a Nexus 10 tablet. And although it\u2019s a smaller screen, the same basic view appears in Google+ on an Android phone or an iPhone, for that matter. The phones show only a single column of information, and you can have the exact same Google+ view in Chrome, or you can set the browser to show two columns. (Hint: Click More in Google+ on Chrome, scroll to the bottom of the menu, and you\u2019ll see the Stream Layout option.) Here\u2019s another example (and one I\u2019m very happy to see): not only can developers take advantage of Google Cloud Messaging for push notifications in apps or Web, but Google is synchronizing notifications. So if you get a new Google+ comment notification on your Android device and read the comment, that same notification won\u2019t appear in Chrome. Or vice versa, of course. Many of the same services\u2014including the new Google Play Games services\u2014are supported by Chrome, Android, and even iOS, now so Google is unifying the experience, making it irrelevant whether you\u2019re using the Web, a phone, or a tablet. Google has said in the past that we\u2019ll see a merger of sorts between Chrome and Android. Now it has shown what it means: Iterate and mature the browser with new technologies that can provide the same experience as some native apps in Android and iOS. It won\u2019t matter what you use in the future in Google\u2019s world: Chrome is the realm of the desktop and laptop, while Android (which also has a Chrome app) will power phones and tablets. The services and APIs that Google offers, however, will allow developers to extend their reach across both of these platforms. With the new Google+ single sign on service, for example, users can get access to a Web app or its Android counterpart. In fact, I was most impressed when Google demonstrated a Web app that, on signing in, asked if it should remotely install the Android application on a phone. These services are the glue that will tie Google\u2019s two platforms together. Frankly\u2014and in hindsight\u2014I\u2019m not sure Google needed to introduce an Android update, a refreshed Nexus 7 tablet, or a new Nexus phone. The story today was about making the experience better and seamless on existing hardware. And we still have tens of millions of devices that haven\u2019t been upgraded to the Jelly Bean version of Android: Iterating it again only exacerbates the Android update challenges. Instead, Google has provided developers new tools to further improve their Web and Android apps at the same time. I can already see the benefits on my Chromebook Pixel: Google+ is already better, the new Hangouts messaging is improved, and my preview of the updated Maps app is incredible. Using the touchscreen, I can zoom out to see the Earth with real-time cloud cover, see the stars where they\u2019re supposed to be, and zoom back in to view panoramic virtual tours of historic locations. The new photo editing in Chrome is on my Pixel, as well, and Google\u2019s cloud power is making my photos look better automatically. Do I wish there was new hardware? Perhaps, but that\u2019s just the gadget geek in me speaking. Software and services are just as important as hardware, and so far, I like what I see there. As long as Google continues to unify the Chrome Web and Android experience in a positive way, I can live with my old phone and tablet. \nAlso from GigaOM:\n Chrome Now Provides Offline Syncing With Google Drive (subscription required) \nLooking for an Alternative to Google Maps for Android?

A month later, prices have stabilized at around $115, and venture capitalists are starting to ink deals to invest in startups built around the crypto-anarchist currency. Investors have been dabbling in the currency for some time, but venture capitalists are just getting into investing in Bitcoin companies. Union Square Ventures jumped in last week, leading a $5 million investment in Coinbase, which charges customers a fee to convert dollars to Bitcoin and vice-versa. At the time, Fred Wilson, managing partner at the New York based venture firm, which was an early investor in Twitter, told the Wall Street Journal that the deal would be a \u201ctrigger point\u201d for investments in Bitcoin startups. A week later, and despite the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s recent seizure of an account operated by Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange, Wilson\u2019s prediction looks good, at least in the short term. On May 14, Liberty City Ventures, a second New York-based venture firm, announced a $15 million fund to invest in startups that focus on Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and Boost VC said it would launch a Bitcoin-related seed fund. On Thursday, Founder\u2019s Fund, the VC firm started by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, said it was leading a $2 million deal in BitPay, which helps businesses process payments in Bitcoin. Are the venture capitalists itching to buy a piece of a Bitcoin startup acting less rashly than the Bitcoin enthusiasts who helped inflate last month\u2019s bubble? It wouldn\u2019t be against character for a venture investor to bet on the latest shiny new thing. Those investments look pretty big, especially given that the currency\u2019s total value is relatively small. As of Thursday, there are something like 11 million Bitcoin in existence.

After all, any schmoe with a couple of Benjamins to rub together can still sign up for some Bitcoins, a timeshare, or an adjustable rate mortgage. So our interest was piqued this week when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued to shut down a lender called Western Sky Financial. The legal battle promises to be complex and interesting because Western Sky claims to be owned by a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and thus not subject to U.S. laws. Schneiderman, in turn, argues it\u2019s simply a corporation registered in South Dakota. So how rickety are Western Sky loans? Very, according to a quick Web search this morning. Its $10,000 loan has a listed annual interest rate of 89.68 percent; 89 percent of the gangsters watching the Whitey Bulger verdict yesterday would likely give better terms. If a borrower were to pay it off over the seven-year period Western Sky prescribes, they would fork out $62,453 for the $10,000. (Well, for the $9,925 loan, once the $75 processing fee is factored in.) That\u2019s the company\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d offer. Its smallest listed loan carries a 343 percent annual interest rate. Under Western Sky\u2019s terms\u2014and once a $350 processing fee is factored in\u2014borrowers would pay $2,159 for $500 up front. In comparison, New York\u2019s interest rate cap is 25 percent. Here\u2019s the sad thing: People are taking these terms. Schneiderman\u2019s filing says at least 17,970 New Yorkers have borrowed of $38 million from Western Sky. In total, they owe $185 million.

To some anarchists, criminals, and their antagonists in law enforcement, it\u2019s primarily seen as a way to conduct financial transactions in private. To others, it\u2019s also a volatile commodity for brave-hearted speculators and an increasingly efficient method to send money back and forth. The Bitcoin Foundation, which went on Monday to meet with regulators in Washington, would like to focus on the last point. The regulators care about how they can smoke out criminals. That may be easier than it seems. Academics have been working on techniques to track Bitcoin transactions and\u2014like many ostensibly private activities on the Internet\u2014the transfers are vulnerable to tricks. While Bitcoin is regularly described as anonymous, it is more accurate to describe it as pseudonymous. Every transaction is stored in a public record called a block chain, with information on the accounts involved and the number of Bitcoins exchanged. This is a necessary part of the structure; analyzing these transactions is how the system makes sure that people aren\u2019t using the the same coins over and over. While Bitcoin is not as transparent to regulators as credit-card transactions, it is much more so than cash. \u201cPolicymakers would never seriously consider banning cash,\u201d (PDF) argues Jerry Brito, director of the technology research program at Mercatus Center at George Mason University, who attended the meetings in Washington. Still, people can set up as many accounts as they want, and nothing within Bitcoin connects real-life identities to the pseudonyms of Bitcoin users. This is why regulators are primarily focused on exchanges, wherein government-issued currencies are converted into Bitcoins, and vice-versa. But given enough data, even anonymous networks can be unraveled, as has been shown with user data from AOL and Netflix. DARPA is so worried that public data could be weaponized, using similar techniques, that it recently put out a call for research projects to explore the idea. In one study, researchers in Germany and Switzerland were able to show that almost 40 percent of Bitcoin user identities could be recovered (PDF), even if they were using the recommended privacy protections. A paper to be presented later this year by researchers from the University of California, San Diego and George Mason University argues that the network\u2019s increased reliance on a few large accounts (PDF) makes user identities less secure. The increasing ease with which large transactions can be tracked to people\u2019s real-world identities \u201cultimately makes Bitcoin unattractive today for high-volume illicit use such as money laundering,\u201d they wrote. The block chain is available to whomever wants to look at it, without subpoena or probable cause. There is no reason why law enforcement officials couldn\u2019t do their own metadata analysis. In fact, they seem to have quite an interest in doing so already. Still, says Brito, the tension with regulators was on display Monday. In part this stemmed from the inability of Bitcoin Foundation to directly address many of the regulators\u2019 concerns: It doesn\u2019t control the technology. Skepticism ruled the day. \u201cI think that they expected the Bitcoin Foundation to have policy answers, and they didn\u2019t because there aren\u2019t easy ones,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are guys who are paid to worry about money laundering, so that\u2019s what they did.

In December, China\u2019s central bank issued guidance that bars\xa0financial institutions from processing transactions in Bitcoin. In other words, its not real currency: You can\u2019t pay off your credit card though a bank account stocked full of Bitcoins. That\u2019s essentially the same gray status that Bitcoin enjoys in the U.S.  Still, the announcement by China\u2019s central bank triggered a big selloff. Between late November and mid-December, Bitcoin\u2019s price fell by more than half, from about $1,100 to a little more than $500. During an on-the-record breakfast at Bloomberg\u2019s Washington (D.C.) office on Wednesday, Lee said that trading volume on BTC China plunged as much as 80 percent after the announcement. That\u2019s spurring him to change the exchange\u2019s business model from one that gets its revenue mostly from fees associated with trading volume to one that offers clients \u201cpremium services.\u201d Far from being banned in China, Lee gave the impression that Bitcoin is gaining a stronger foothold there than in the U.S. For one, he said, it\u2019s far easier to set up a Bitcoin exchange in China, partly because there\u2019s just one government entity to deal with rather than the collection of state and federal agencies in the U.S. Yet the U.S. appears to be winning the fight for investors. According to a report from Aite Group, of the $117 million in venture capital investments directed toward Bitcoin startups so far, $98.6 million has been funneled to 19 companies in North America, while just $13.3 million has gone to nine startups in Asia. Earlier this week, David Cohen, under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the U.S. Treasury Department, gave a somewhat tacit approval to Bitcoin. My Bloomberg Businessweek colleague Josh Brustein summed up Cohen\u2019s message as basically saying that so long as Bitcoin remains impractical, Treasury will leave it alone. That\u2019s good news for now, but for pioneers such as Lee, the challenge of legitimizing Bitcoin isn\u2019t so much in keeping it out of the hands of terrorists as in getting into the hands of everyone else. In Lee\u2019s opinion, we\u2019re past the point at which governments can stop Bitcoin: It\u2019s global, it\u2019s decentralized, and, as bizarre as it may seem, it has obvious potential as a disruptive force. But in terms of its evolution, Bitcoin is still embryonic. Lee compared Bitcoin in 2014 to the Internet in 1993. Over the next five to 10 years, he expects a tidal wave of venture capital to pour into the business, just as VC\u2019s began pumping billions into Web startups in the mid to late 1990s. Keeping with the dot-com comparison, it seems fair to say that a crash or two will follow before Bitcoin begins the slow, steady climb to legitimacy. If Bitcoin makes it that far, that\u2019s when the big questions will start getting answered about how governments view it and whether businesses can be persuaded to start accepting it en masse as a form of payment around the world.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/matthewaphilips', 'name': u'Matthew Philips', 'twitterhandle': u'matthewaphilips'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-20/btc-chinas-bobby-lee-bitcoin-isnt-really-banned-in-china-and-its-quickly-gaining-ground', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 20, 20, 11, 39, 586000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Bitcoin Isn't Really Banned in China\u2014and It's Quickly Gaining Ground"}, {'articleText': u' At first glance, Mt. Gox might not seem like a particularly attractive acquisition. The now defunct Bitcoin exchange imploded earlier this year: Millions of customers\u2019 money went missing, and the foundations of the Bitcoin economy were shaken profoundly. The company has no especially useful technology or intellectual property, is caught up in courts across the globe, and has a brand that is, to put it mildly, damaged. But this is Bitcoin, and the story wouldn\u2019t be strange enough if things ended there. A group of investors led by Brock Pierce, a child actor who starred in the first two Mighty Ducks movies, wants to buy the exchange for a single Bitcoin. As part of a deal to settle a class-action lawsuit against Mt. Gox, Pierce\u2019s group, Sunlot Holdings, would also commit to trying to recover Mt. Gox\u2019s customers\u2019 losses. The company wants to open a new, global Bitcoin exchange with a physical presence in the U.S., which would put it under the jurisdiction of American regulators. Why bother rebuilding the shell of a disgraced company rather than just starting a new one? John Betts, a South African investor serving as Pierce\u2019s partner in the venture, agreed to a phone interview. (Pierce initially agreed to discuss his plans with\xa0Bloomberg Businessweek\xa0but stopped responding to e-mails.) Sunlot\u2019s rationale for getting in on this circus is appropriately Barnum-esque: There\u2019s no such thing as bad press. \u201cThis has been something that has gotten worldwide attention and coverage. Even my parents back in my town in South Africa heard about it on their local news,\u201d says Betts. \u201cIt\u2019s our belief that we can turn this negative coverage into something quite positive and constructive.\u201d The group has been trying to buy a part of the exchange well before the Goxalypse. Betts says that Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox\u2019s chief executive officer, declined to sell them a share of the company in January, and a partnership in which Sunlot would have established a Chinese arm of Mt. Gox fell through. When news broke in February that Mt. Gox had lost all of its customers\u2019 Bitcoins, leading to the prompt shuttering of the company, Sunlot quickly prepared a new takeover plan. The swiftness of the whole thing has led to whispers about a conspiracy, including speculation that Sunlot was involved in leaking the documents that felled Mt. Gox in the first place. In the months since, Betts and Pierce have been pushing Karpeles to sell. The new takeover plan came together after Japanese authorities decided to liquidate Mt. Gox\u2019s assets. Sunlot then\xa0launched a \u201cSave Gox\u201d campaign.\xa0Jay Edelson, a lawyer pursuing a class action in Illinois on behalf of Mt. Gox accountholders, agreed that liquidation would have made it almost impossible for American customers to recoup any significant losses. \u201cThat really changed the playing field, and it meant that certain interests were then aligned,\u201d says Edelson. \u201cA lot of people had pressure to salvage the company.\u201d So Edelson and Sunlot scurried to come up with an agreement and presented it to a judge earlier this week. The judge is considering the proposal after a hearing on Thursday, and Betts says they expect a ruling in several weeks. Japanese authorities would also have to approve the deal. If the agreement goes through, Sunlot will buy Mt. Gox for the token amount of a single Bitcoin (currently worth about $448). It will be in charge of redistributing the company\u2019s existing assets to its customers, who will get a cut of Mt. Gox\u2019s current stash of currency and Bitcoins based on how much they lost. A fund of $10\xa0million will be set aside for Sunlot to use as it tries to recover the lost Bitcoins. If successful, the search could prove lucrative: Sunlot would get 10\xa0percent of what it recovers. A judge\u2019s approval wouldn\u2019t mean the end of the lawsuits. Edelson\u2019s case will continue, with Karpeles as the target. Two of Mt. Gox\u2019s owners are cooperating with the search as part of the settlement. The agreement is also structured to give Mt. Gox\u2019s former customers a reason to cheer for its second coming. In addition to recovering lost Bitcoins, they\u2019ll get a 16.5\xa0percent stake in Sunlot. In a particularly optimistic portion of the proposed settlement, Sunlot even lays out what would happen in the case of a future initial public offering. Aside from its customers, the only thing that will remain of the original Mt. Gox is its name. Betts says Sunlot will throw out all of the code that Karpeles\u2019s company used and build an exchange from scratch. It could be a challenge to persuade new customers to sign up. Many Bitcoin bulls saw the fall of Mt. Gox as a necessary cleansing of the Bitcoin economy, leaving room for real professionals to build trustworthy exchanges. It\u2019s not clear whether Sunlot is well placed to outcompete operations such as the exchange being established by Barry Silbert, the founder of Second Market. Betts seems to think the settlement would at least give the new Mt. Gox a fighting chance. \u201cIf the customers like what we\u2019ve done, and think that we\u2019ve built a good business, hopefully they\u2019ll do business with us,\u201d he says.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-02/a-mighty-ducks-child-star-has-a-plan-for-failed-bitcoin-exchange-mt-dot-gox', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 5, 3, 17, 46, 36, 418000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'A Mighty Ducks Child Star Has a Plan for Failed Bitcoin Exchange Mt.

Sure enough, Mt. Gox, the Japanese company that was once the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, seems to have met its demise on Monday\xa0night after losing hundreds of millions of dollars of its customers\u2019 Bitcoins. After being valued at more than $1,000 late last year, Bitcoins are trading around $500. It\xa0has been clear for a while\xa0that something is seriously wrong with Mt. Gox, which spent most of last year having its accounts seized by government regulators and experiencing increasing trouble allowing its customers to get at their money. Earlier this month the site\xa0restricted withdrawals, citing technical problems.\xa0On Sunday\xa0the company\u2019s chief executive resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, the primary advocacy group for Bitcoin. Then\xa0on Monday, Ryan Galt, a Bitcoin blogger, posted a document purporting to\xa0outline a crisis strategy from Mt. Gox. In the document,\xa0the company copped to having lost track of 744,000 Bitcoins, which seemed to have been stolen over the course of several weeks as the exchange struggled with security issues. Mt. Gox soon took down its site and erased its\xa0Twitter feed.

Gox wrote: \u201cIn light of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox\u2019s operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.\u201d Some Bitcoin believers are cheering the development, hailing it as the end of amateur hour for the crypto-currency. \u201cIt purges the final vestige of the first generation of infrastructure companies,\u201d says Jerry Brito,\xa0director of the technology research program at Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a longtime proponent of Bitcoin.\xa0\u201cWho\u2019s left? It\u2019s the serious people, who are doing this right.\u201d Those people are working hard to assure the market that they are, in fact, serious.\xa0Several prominent Bitcoin companies signed on to a statement\xa0vowing to shore up the credibility of the currency.\xa0The\xa0companies describe the need for Bitcoin companies to submit to independent audits, balance sheet requirements, customer disclosures, and policies that don\u2019t allow companies to leverage customer assets for their own trading. The companies signing the statement were Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp.net, BTC China, Blockchain.info, and Circle. In a fortuitously timed but otherwise unrelated development, Barry Silbert, founder of SecondMarket, said\xa0Monday\xa0night that he was launching an exchange that would function much like the New York Stock Exchange;\xa0 regulated\xa0institutions would trade Bitcoin for customers, rather than having millions of people move cybercurrency into dollars and back on their own. The exchange will also set the value for Bitcoin twice daily in an attempt to reduce its infamous volatility. \u201cThis is the best way to get the existing financial establishment to participate in the Bitcoin space,\u201d says Silbert. He\xa0says he\u2019s been talking to a half-dozen large financial\xa0institutions, as well as such Bitcoin companies as Coinbase, about joining\xa0the exchange.\xa0As of\xa0Tuesday morning, Silbert says he hasn\u2019t discussed the Mt. Gox\xa0situation with any of his prospective partners. Nothing that has happened indicates any problem with\xa0the technology on which Bitcoin is based. But Mt. Gox\u2019s failure is likely to shake the social and\xa0psychological\xa0foundations of the Bitcoin craze. The libertarian streak that has accompanied the currency since its inception is steadily losing ground as non-ideological investors and speculators join in. The failure of a major exchange would seem to bolster the case for greater regulation in the Bitcoin world, although it\u2019s unclear when or if regulators will step in to prevent future disasters.\xa0\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult to argue with anything they propose,\u201d says Brito.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-25/true-believers-cheer-the-fall-of-bitcoin-exchange-mt-dot-gox', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 26, 18, 50, 37, 628000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'True Believers Cheer the Fall of Bitcoin Exchange Mt.

Bitcoin has no central administrator; a network of computers run by volunteers validates transactions, which require encrypted electronic signatures. While advocates see digital currencies as the money of the future, Bitcoin will have to overcome a number of hurdles, including concerns about security, before becoming widely accepted. The first Bitcoin users were mostly investors seeking to profit from the currency\u2019s wild swings, libertarians drawn to the freedom from government control, and tech geeks who deem paper money and credit cards antiquated.

Shelton\u2019s father, Zach, has been giving his kids their allowances in Bitcoin for about six months. \u201cIf I was a father in 1995, I\u2019d want my children to learn programming and to navigate on the Internet,\u201d he says. \u201cFast-forward about 20 years, and we have this technology.\u201d Seeing the potential to attract a new group of customers, merchants are luring Bitcoiners with discounts. In one promotion, Dell knocked $150 off Alienware computer systems. Most merchants list prices in dollars and use the current exchange rate to calculate the price in Bitcoin. Most also immediately convert Bitcoins into dollars via services like BitPay and Coinbase to protect against swings in the digital currency\u2019s value, although a few keep some of the Bitcoins they receive. Electronics Web merchant Newegg offered users $75 off purchases of $300 or more and $150 off orders of more than $500.  Brooke Mallers, a stay-at-home mom with six kids in Evanston, Ill., first spent Bitcoin last fall, when she bought her children Nike and other gift cards for Christmas. In April, she and her husband used Bitcoin to buy patio furniture on Overstock.com; in July, she purchased a Dell gaming computer for the kids. \u201cI have a Ph.D. in English lit,\u201d she says. \u201cNeither of us has a technical background. I just like the idea of decentralization, that things are more distributed. We just think it\u2019s awesome. We are kind of fanatic about it.\u201d Bitcoin is catching on outside the U.S., too. Peter Surda, an economist in Vienna, uses it two or three times a week to buy everything from food to electronics to plane tickets. \u201cSpending Bitcoin did indeed become easier, because more merchants accept it,\u201d he said in an e-mail. \u201cAlso, various integration services do the purchases on your behalf, even if the merchants have no idea what Bitcoin is.\u201d If anything, using the currency to buy goods and services is even more popular in Europe than in the U.S., says Tony Gallippi, co-founder of BitPay, which is based in Atlanta. \u201cThe adoption of the euro is a really good parallel to the adoption of Bitcoin.

During his senior year, he and two classmates launched BufferBox, a delivery service that lets consumers send packages and online purchases to secure locations for pickup. After college, the startup was accepted into the Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator, then Google acquired BufferBox for north of $25\xa0million, according to TechCrunch. \u201cI remember waking up one day and just thinking to myself, things really couldn\u2019t get any crazier,\u201d McCauley says. \u201cAll this is happening, and I\u2019m not even 25.\u201d It\u2019s a familiar story in the Valley, except that McCauley isn\u2019t the product of Stanford University or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His alma mater is the University of Waterloo\u2014as in Waterloo, Ont., home to BlackBerry, one of the biggest flameouts in tech history. In Canada, Waterloo University is still a source of national pride. It\u2019s been voted the country\u2019s most innovative school for the past 21 years by the Canadian magazine Maclean\u2019s. The engineering program, where tuition runs $12,200 per year, has emerged as a farm system for Silicon Valley companies such as Tesla Motors, Twitter, and Facebook. Last year an estimated one-third of Waterloo\u2019s graduating software engineers received job offers from U.S. companies, says Dean of Engineering Pearl Sullivan, adding that Silicon Valley executives often fly into town to drop off business cards. \u201cThe University of Waterloo is among the top few universities Google recruits from around the world,\u201d says Steve Woods, Google\u2019s director of engineering in Canada. \u201cUW graduates do well.\u201d Waterloo is a sleepy, postindustrial city of 100,000, a little less than 200\xa0miles northeast of Detroit. BlackBerry\u2019s co-founder, Mike Lazaridis, dropped out of the electrical engineering program, but over the years he\u2019s provided the school with regular access to his company\u2019s research labs\u2014and with more than $120\xa0million to fund projects, including the construction of quantum computing facilities. Google is among the U.S. tech companies that have opened local offices. During BlackBerry\u2019s glory years as a smartphone pioneer, its success helped fuel a boom in local startups eager to recruit UW grads. There were only a handful of such startups in the area in 2000; this year there are almost 700, according to startup coalition Communitech. While the region had only 50 tech firms in 1997, it now has 1,000 that collectively generate at least $30\xa0billion in annual revenue.  Those startups leave the school sanguine about BlackBerry\u2019s decline. BlackBerry, which had an $83\xa0billion market capitalization in 2008, is weighing a $4.7\xa0billion takeover bid. In the last couple of months it reported a $934\xa0million writedown for unsold phones and said it would fire 4,500\xa0workers. \u201cI don\u2019t think our reputation exists because of BlackBerry,\u201d says UW spokesman Tim Jackson. \u201cIn large part, BlackBerry is here because of the University of Waterloo.\u201d Waterloo has long attracted professors by promising them full intellectual-property rights for their inventions\u2014a rarity in academia. Dave Dietz, director of the University of Waterloo\u2019s engineering research, says Lazaridis\u2019s financial gifts have helped lure big names to the area. Once, when Waterloo was about to poach a top professor from MIT but didn\u2019t have any lab space for him, Lazaridis agreed to finance the construction of a new building. \u201cTo me he\u2019s an archangel who comes and solves problems,\u201d says Raymond Laflamme, executive director of the school\u2019s Institute for Quantum Computing. Lazaridis didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Waterloo\u2019s biggest strength lies in its co-op program, which requires students to do six four-month stints with companies. It\u2019s the world\u2019s largest such program, according to the Cooperative Education & Internship Association. Waterloo\u2019s engineers fill roughly 7,000\xa0co-op positions at 1,600 companies a year. With two years of added work experience on their r\xe9sum\xe9s, some 96\xa0percent of graduating software engineers find work within six months of receiving their diplomas, according to Sullivan. For freshmen, co-op positions can begin as soon as four months into their college careers. Most are paid about $8,000, and some fourth-year students make as much as $40,000 per stint. Last year, Waterloo engineering students earned a total of $111\xa0million during co-op terms, working for big tech companies, local startups, corporate labs, or professors at other schools, the university says. BufferBox\u2019s McCauley, now a Google product manager, says Waterloo\u2019s co-op program gave him and his co-founders the confidence to start their own company. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t done my six terms of co-op,\u201d he says, the job offer he received in his senior year would have been so attractive that \u201cI would have taken it in a heartbeat.\u201d   Waterloo\u2019s co-op program is costly, as it requires the school to remain open year-round to accommodate students\u2019 work schedules. Given that 87\xa0percent of Waterloo\u2019s students are Canadian, obtaining American work visas for so many students can be onerous. Waterloo grads who found companies in the Valley often struggle to pay engineers twice as much in California as they would in Ontario, McCauley says. \u201cThere\u2019ve been a slew of companies that started in Waterloo, went to Silicon Valley, and then came back,\u201d he says, though he adds that hometown pride has a lot to do with that. As BlackBerry struggles, Waterloo has made it a priority to encourage development closer to home. In 2010 it finished a state-of-the-art design center with an airy communal work space where students work on extracurricular projects such as solar cars and, believe it or not, concrete canoes. The university also connects engineers with local incubators such as VeloCity, located in the huge building that once housed Canada\u2019s largest tannery. With offers from Google and Twitter, Waterloo graduate Trevor Creech stayed in town to co-found a startup that simplifies the purchase of the electronic currency Bitcoin. He says he\u2019s the exception, though. \u201cMost of my friends are down in the Valley,\u201d Creech says. \u201cAt Facebook, Twitter, and a lot of startups.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': u'Caroline Winter', 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-31/university-of-waterloo-silicon-valleys-canadian-feeder-school', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 1, 1, 46, 42, 975000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"University of Waterloo: Silicon Valley's Canadian Feeder School"}, {'articleText': u' On a mission to convince the world that Bitcoin is enduring and serious, enthusiasts convened at a place that symbolizes the ephemeral and the glitzy: Las Vegas. At the Inside Bitcoins conference on Dec. 10 and 11\u2014sponsored by BubbleCoin, BitDeliver, CoinComply, and other companies\u2014the top issue for many attendees was how to persuade regulators that the digital money and payment system is a valuable financial market innovation, rather than the currency of choice for illicit gambling and drug purchases. Banks shun Bitcoin companies \u201cbecause it\u2019s scary,\u201d says Jered Kenna, founder of Tradehill, a Bitcoin exchange that shut down this summer after its bank closed its account. \u201cIf the banks aren\u2019t sure, they default to \u2018no.\u2019\u2009\u201d  Introduced in 2008 by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the most prominent of a group of virtual currencies\u2014money that exists mainly as computer code\u2014that have no central issuing authority. Bitcoins are stored in electronic wallets, which are identified only by a string of letters and numbers, and can be traded on online exchanges and converted to cash. They are created by computers that solve difficult cryptographic problems. As more coins are created, the problems get tougher. The system is designed to produce no more than 21 million Bitcoins. About 12 million exist.  Today, despite its ambiguous status, Bitcoin can be used to pay for T-shirts, food, and electronics. A Manhattan psychiatrist has been accepting Bitcoin as payment since 2012. His website features a \u201cBitcoin accepted here\u201d sticker. This year through Dec. 10, the currency, which can swing wildly, has gained more than 7,000\xa0percent, to $990, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which monitors prices on major exchanges.   As its popularity grows, Bitcoin is attracting increasing scrutiny from regulators. Prices jumped in November after a U.S. Department of Justice official described the currency as \u201ca legal means of exchange\u201d at a Senate hearing. Still, another regulator at the same hearing warned that Bitcoin-related businesses would need to meet current money laundering standards before banks would agree to work with them. On Dec.\xa05, China\u2019s central bank barred financial institutions from buying and selling the virtual currency and from pricing products in Bitcoin, sending prices tumbling more than 10\xa0percent. After the bank\u2019s announcement, Baidu, China\u2019s biggest search engine, stopped accepting Bitcoin. Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, subpoenaed 22 Bitcoin-related companies this summer to determine whether new regulations are needed to cover them. \u201cVirtual currencies may turn out to be a very big thing,\u201d he said in October. \u201cRight now, it feels as if the major advantage they\u2019re providing is anonymity,\u201d which appeals to \u201cmoney launderers\u201d and \u201cterrorists.\u201d  Regulators have already pressured banks to close some Bitcoin-related accounts. In August, Internet Archive Federal Credit Union dumped Bitcoin-related clients\u2014including Tradehill\u2014for what it called \u201cregulatory issues.\u201d U.S. officials shut an account at Wells Fargo used by Mt. Gox, a Japan-based exchange, to service U.S. customers. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. Banks are reacting to Bitcoin the way most people do to any new type of payment, according to Mary Dent, a former vice president at Silicon Valley Bank. \u201cIf you heard about somebody getting mugged for the first time, you\u2019d think cash is crazy,\u201d says Dent, who now runs her own consulting firm. \u201cIf you heard about credit card fraud for the first time, you\u2019d think cards are crazy. Bitcoin is suffering from that.\u201d At the Las Vegas conference, three companies announced the creation of a Bitcoin trade group to \u201cprotect the rights of developers, entrepreneurs, and users\u201d called the Consortium of Decentralized Applications (CoDA).  Other companies have hired lawyers and former regulators to make their case to government agencies and demonstrate to potential banking partners that they take regulators seriously. In October, Jeremy Allaire founded Circle Internet Financial, which will develop virtual currency payment systems, with a $9\xa0million investment from Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners\u2014the biggest venture capital investment yet for a Bitcoin company. One of Allaire\u2019s first moves was to hire John Beccia, former chief regulatory counsel for the Financial Services Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, and the dominant payment networks, Visa and MasterCard International. Circle also put Raj Date, former deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on its board. The financial-services establishment remains skeptical. Richard Riese, senior vice president of the American Bankers Association, said the ability to handle Bitcoin transactions \u201cis not high on our members\u2019 list\u201d of priorities. Kenna, the head of Bitcoin exchange Tradehill, emphasized that \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d the industry would rely on banks and need to respond to their concerns. \u201cAnd the foreseeable future could be 50 years.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/CarterD', 'name': u'Carter Dougherty', 'twitterhandle': u'CarterD'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-12/bitcoin-needs-banks-for-wider-acceptance-as-regulatory-scrutiny-rises', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 12, 21, 59, 46, 217000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Why Bitcoin Needs Banks'}, {'articleText': u" Among the tens of millions of bitcoin accounts opened worldwide, there's a wide range of users: Everyone from folks buying marijuana from vending machines that take the virtual currency to parents doling out the digital money as an allowance to their kids. As Bloomberg News reporter Olga Kharif wrote about today, bitcoins are also catching on with consumers outside of the U.S., especially in emerging markets. So which countries are most likely to see mass adoption of bitcoins?  Coindesk, which covers the news and prices on digital currencies, recently came up with this top 10 list: The ranking is based on 39 variables. Among the categories examined to determine the ranking: technology penetration, inflation, history of financial crises and the size of a nation's black market. Given Argentina's financial problems, it shouldn't be surprising that the South American country is at the top of the list, according to Coindesk. Similar to Argentina, Venezuela's economic difficulties placed it high in the ranking. Concerns over the country recently led one economist to ask Venezuela's central bank officials to show him their stockpile of gold, which accounts for 71 percent of the nation's foreign reserves. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe ranked no. 3 in large part because of its big informal economy, Coindesk said. Not on the top 10: China.

The price of the digital currency has rallied over the past few days, partly because some Greeks have been snapping up the currency amid bank closures and cash withdrawal limits. It's trading at the highest rate since March, and Bitcoin bulls expect demand to go even higher if the situation worsens. Citing the Greek crisis, Coinbase waived fees last week for customers buying Bitcoin with euros. But over the weekend, Bitcoin's software provided a well-timed reminder of why it's not the perfect financial system, either. Bitcoin transactions have been taking five times longer than usual to complete, according to Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. That's because the system for authorizing and approving transactions within the Bitcoin network has been functioning incorrectly. So anyone who sells a computer, say, on Craigslist for Bitcoin may want to wait five hours to confirm that the payment actually went through, Luria says. The problems stem from a new version of the Bitcoin software that runs on PCs and servers underpinning the currency's decentralized system. Operators who haven't upgraded their machines to the latest software have put the whole system out of whack, and it's also preventing some people from generating new Bitcoin as part of a process called mining. While Luria says the software issue will likely be fixed in the next couple of days, this isn't the first time it's happened. Similar problems have cropped up several times in recent years. \u201cBut I don't know that it's happened to this extent, because Bitcoin has never been this big,\u201d Luria says. Part of that may be due to the increased popularity of Bitcoin. Nearly 120,000 Bitcoin transactions took place on a single day in early June, up 10 times from June 2011, according to CoinDesk, a Bitcoin researcher and news site. When creating a system with no single overseer, these sorts of stumbles come with the territory. When a company decides to upgrade to, say, Windows 8, it can deploy the software to every computer on its network at the same time. With Bitcoin, however, it's up to each operator to install a new version on his or her\xa0own. \u201cThis is a test of a decentralized network,\u201d Luria says. \u201cEvery time Bitcoin passes one of these tests, it gets stronger.\u201d But if the issue isn't fixed within a week, Bitcoin will have a big problem on its hands, he adds. In the future, Bitcoin software upgrades could go more smoothly if companies continue to take market share of Bitcoin machines from hobbyists. Businesses tend to stay on top of updates. KnCMiner, which sells Bitcoin mining equipment and operates a massive server farm for Bitcoin in Sweden, upgraded its software two months ago, says Nanok Bie, a marketing director at the company. In the past year or so, mining for Bitcoin has become lucrative for only the largest operators. BTC Guild, a collective of such participating computers, shut down on June 30 because it couldn't turn a profit. The trend is expected to continue.

The article refers to an alleged freezing of investments made by Andes Petroleum and Repsol in Ecuador, based on unauthorized and anonymous information sources, without presenting any solid proof. In fact, both oil companies and official statements denied this information or having provided any national or international means of communication, with information on this matter. The same happened with false claims on the provision of services of Halliburton in Ecuador. Therefore, I would like to inform you that, contrary to what the article\u2019s authors assert, both Repsol and Andes Petroleum have not reduced their investments in the Ecuadorian State. For your reference, in the period 2011-2014, the oil investment committed by private companies in the country was at least USD 1304.90 million. During that period, there was an actual execution of USD 1764.51 million, exceeding USD 459 610 000 of the committed amount. It should be noted that one of the aforementioned companies in the report, Repsol, between 2011 and 2014, invested $306.78 million in the development of production on Block 16 and Block Tivacuno in the Amazon region of Ecuador, exceeding in USD 40, 33 million the initial amount pledged to the Ecuadorian State (USD 266.45 million). Meanwhile, Andes Petroleum invested USD 571.51 million during the same period, in the Tarapoa field of the Amazon, exceeding USD 230.58 million pledged to the Ecuadorian State. This year, there is a pledge to invest USD 307 million from private companies in Ecuador. In the first quarter, 26.71% executed of this budget was registered, which accounts for a timely allocation of resources in the country\u2019s oil production. Between January and March this year, they accomplished USD 82 million. With respect to the aforementioned companies, Repsol pledged to invest USD 43.12 million, out of which it has already invested 9.72 between January and March of this year (22.61%). On the other hand, Andes Petroleum pledged an investment of USD 70.91 million, out of which, it has already executed 46% (USD 33.15 million) only in the first quarter. Regarding the delay of drilling, also mentioned in the article, it states that President Correa made spending cuts. While this is true, authors use this information to assert that the Ecuadorian government has delayed payments to oil operators due to low oil prices. This second assertion is not supported by any objective evidence, but tries to be based on facts that have no relationship to Ecuador. For example, they talk about the situation of Halliburton in other countries, particularly the United States, where the oil industry is massively laying off its employees. This is not the first time an article signed by Nathan Gill violates the basic rules of responsible and ethic journalism. It increasingly exposes their lack of professionalism by publishing false information intended to harm the Ecuadorian Government. We already reported this situation on August 8, 2014, in a letter addressed to Bloomberg Agency signed by Economist Patricio Rivera, Coordinating Minister of Economic Policies, and Economist Diego Mart\xednez Vinueza, President of the Directory of the Central Bank in Ecuador as a reply to the article \u201cBitcoin-Like Money is Ecuador\xb4s Latest Dollar-Saving Plan\u201d published August 5, 2014. Due to a conflict of interests with the oil company Chevron, Nathan Gill contributes with these types of articles to media, and public relations lobbying campaign that the mentioned oil company has promoted in the United States and the world, even in Ecuador, in order to discredit the Ecuadorian government through Public Relations companies closely linked to Gill. For all these reasons, I request this letter to be made public in your media in order to inform your audience the real facts in terms of stability of oil investments in Ecuador. Likewise, we reserve the right to take legal action if warranted in any court having jurisdiction over this matter for all damages caused to the Republic of Ecuador by the mentioned article. -Fernando Alvarado EspinelNational Secretary of Communication and the annexes Republic of Ecuador', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-14/ecuador-responds-to-bloomberg-article-fernando-alvarado-espinel', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 5, 14, 18, 49, 59, 179000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Ecuador Responds to Bloomberg Article: Fernando Alvarado Espinel'}, {'articleText': u' Yes, his lawyer acknowledged in federal court that Ross Ulbricht started the Silk Road website that would in its brief heyday become the Amazon of illegal\xa0drugs. But he wasn\u2019t a kingpin who oversaw\xa0hundreds of millions of dollars\' worth of black market transactions. No, his lawyer insisted, Ulbricht was an idealistic and\xa0naive kid who got caught up with professional criminals and\xa0used as a fall guy once the Silk Road\xa0empire was doomed.\xa0 \u201cSilk Road was Ross\u2019s idea, and he created it,\u201d defense attorney Joshua Dratel declared on Tuesday during his opening\xa0statement. But Ulbricht\u2019s\xa0intention was more to create a libertarian marketplace than an expansive online drug bazaar.\xa0\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of experiment, an economics experiment," Dratel said, "and after a few months it got too stressful."\xa0 Ulbricht, 30, has always maintained his innocence but it hasn\u2019t been clear how he would argue for it. After all, when he was arrested in a San Francisco public library in October 2013, he had his laptop open to the Silk Road administrator\'s page. On the computer were diaries outlining the conception of\xa0Silk Road and its operation, according to prosecutors, as well as $18 million in\xa0Bitcoin. The haplessness of Ulbricht\'s arrest only underscores his\xa0complete lack\xa0of the\xa0savvy needed to run an operation like Silk Road, his lawyer explained. The defense will argue that the character on trial in Manhattan\u2014the Dread Pirate Roberts, nom de Internet of the Silk Road\'s mastermind\u2014is still out there somewhere.\xa0 The Silk Road trial has promised to be both an\xa0important look at online crime and anonymity, as well as\xa0a great tale. Those who packed the federal courthouse on Tuesday got a bit of both. Timothy Howard, one of the prosecutors in the case, started his opening statement by describing "a dark and secret part" of the Internet with\xa0salacious details: 1\xa0million drug deals had been\xa0completed on Silk Road, worth over $200 million, before it was shut down. Prosecutors claim that Ulbricht came up with\xa0the idea for Silk Road in 2009, built the website, and then advertised it by mentioning it\xa0in\xa0various drug-related chat rooms. The first products on the site: hallucinogenic mushrooms that Ulbricht allegedly grew himself. Prosecutors also claim that Ulbricht\xa0eventually attempted to resort to violence to maintain his power. If the defendant didn\'t enjoy the trappings of wealth, the government argues, it was\xa0only because he\xa0planned to lay low before escaping to the Caribbean. The prosecution\u2019s first witness, a\xa0special agent with\xa0the Department of Homeland Security, began seizing envelopes containing small numbers of Ecstasy pills in the fall of 2011. While\xa0the agency\xa0occasionally captured contraband being shipped\xa0through the mail, these envelopes were different. Envelopes with a few pills were almost always isolated events; in this case, however, agents found batches of identically packaged shipments making it clear that a\xa0sizable commercial operation had begun. DHS confiscated 3,600 envelopes over the next two years and arrested a number of dealers involved with the site. Information from those arrests helped the feds\xa0set up an employee account at Silk Road, which in turn allowed the government to communicate directly with the\xa0Dread Pirate Roberts.\xa0 None of the Silk Road\xa0Jurors Read News on the Internet The first day of a trial expected to last for more than a month saw the first\xa0instance\xa0of what promises to be a numbing task of explaining to jurors the rather esoteric technology used in the case. Prosecutors launched into a basic explanation of\xa0Tor, a tool for anonymous Internet browsing needed to access Silk Road, at about 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Several jurors were visibly\xa0droopy-eyed at this point.\xa0 One technical point elided in\xa0Howard\'s remarks was the means by which investigators uncovered the location of Silk Road\'s servers and Ulbricht himself. This was a controversial point in pretrial hearings, with Ulbricht\u2019s legal team claiming that much of\xa0the evidence should be excluded unless the FBI could\xa0explain how it was obtained. Judge Katherine Forrest instead told jurors that they should assume all evidence was obtained legally. Lawyers from both sides of the case and\xa0the judge agreed that jurors wouldn\u2019t need\xa0any specific technical\xa0knowledge to figure this case out. But it was impossible not to notice that Ulbricht isn\u2019t quite being tried by his peers. During the jury\xa0selection process, not a single candidate\xa0said he or she had heard of Silk Road or had any particular knowledge of cybersecurity. Only a single potential\xa0juror\xa0explicitly claimed to get her news from the Internet; she didn\u2019t make the cut. The final jury is evenly\xa0split at six men and six\xa0women, and only two are anywhere near Ulbricht\u2019s age. The defendant showed up in court looking preppy and comfortable in a dark jacket and khakis. He was engaged with his legal team, participating in huddles about which\xa0jurors to challenge. He also turned around periodically to smile and nod at his family during\xa0slow\xa0moments in the trial. At one tedious point near the end of jury selection he\xa0swiveled in his chair and feigned a big yawn.\xa0 Dratel started his opening\xa0statement with a fatherly gesture toward Ulbricht, standing up from his chair and grasping his client by both shoulders. He then proceeded to talk about Ulbricht as a child who had gone astray but shouldn\u2019t be punished too harshly for mistakes he didn\u2019t quite understand.\xa0In large part, however, Dratel agreed with the prosecution: The Dread Pirate Roberts was a clever and sophisticated online criminal who knew how to cover his tracks and use\xa0ruthless tactics. But Ulbricht clearly wasn\u2019t that person, according to his lawyer. Why would a criminal mastermind run his empire from\xa0the science fiction section\xa0of the public\xa0library? If Ulbricht was so vital to the online drug trade, how did Silk Road\u2019s successor websites emerge just weeks after his arrest?\xa0 Ulbricht\'s defense will argue that he fled Silk Road after things got out of\xa0control, soon after its creation. But about a month before his arrest, Dratel claimed, the people running the site learned\xa0that law\xa0enforcement had identified them. To avoid punishment, they reached out\xa0to Ulbricht and persuaded him to take on an administrative role\u2014leaving him holding the bag.\xa0 Then there\u2019s the matter of the $18 million in Bitcoin found on Ulbricht\u2019s computer when he was arrested. Dratel claims this virtual fortune came not from taking a commission on hundreds of millions of dollars\' worth of drug deals, but from placing what turned out to be a great bet on Bitcoin when it was practically worthless. Dratel\xa0promised to show that the amount of money that Dread Pirate Roberts should have made\xa0through the site would dwarf anything Ulbricht was found holding.\xa0 Explaining how a multimillion-dollar fortune is a pittance is just one of the counterintuitive narrative threads that Dratel is going to have to make convincing\xa0to jurors. But that\u2019s what should make the next month so interesting. \u201cThis case, to a large\xa0extent, is about the Internet and the digital world,\u201d said Dratel, "where not\xa0everything is at it seems.\u201d\xa0', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-14/the-silk-road-defense-this-guy-is-no-black-market-mastermind', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 14, 0, 29, 6, 802000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'The Silk Road Defense: This Guy\xa0Is No Black Market Mastermind'}, {'articleText': u" (This version corrects the description of the AllianceBernstein All Market Real Return Portfolio's top holdings.)To lose money in the markets in 2013, you had to really try. Three-quarters of the world's stocks rose, by an average of 42 percent. The S&P 500 jumped 30 percent. This year, the S&P's up another 12 percent, but the market laid lots of traps for investors. You could have owned lots of energy stocks while the price of oil was plunging. Or, almost anything in Russia or Eastern Europe while the Ruble was in free fall. You could have easily panicked and sold out during the intense sell-offs in late January, October and December, then missed out on the market's rebounds. As the year comes to an end, Bloomberg.com tallied the year\u2019s winning and losing investments. These are the bets that saved or ruined portfolios in 2014. Beware: There's absolutely no guarantee they'll do the same thing next year. All results reflect total returns as of Dec. 21. \u2022 U.S. Large-Cap Stocks Best: Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), +156 percent Worst: Sprint Corp. (S), -61 percent Semiconductor company Skyworks Solutions makes the components in mobile phones and other devices that connect them to wireless Internet. Last quarter, its sales were up 51 percent year-over-year. If you'd invested $10,000 on Jan. 1, it would be worth $25,630 today.  To hold onto subscribers, Sprint has aggressively cut prices on its mobile phone service. It reported a profit in just one of the past four quarters. If you'd invested $10,000 on Jan. 1, it would be worth $3,870 today.  Criteria: Of 493 stocks on U.S. exchanges with market capitalizations of more than $10 billion. \u2022 International Stocks Best: Hanergy Thin Film Power Group (566 HK), +249 percent Worst: Arrium Limited (ARI AU), -89 percent By buying up three U.S. and one German solar companies, the Hong Kong-based Hanergy is positioning itself as a leading maker of thin-film solar panels. If you'd invested $10,000 on Jan. 1, it would be worth $34,892 today.  The drop in global commodity prices hit Australia\u2019s mining industry hard. Arrium\u2019s 89 percent drop this year follows its 92 percent rise in 2013. If you'd invested $10,000 on Jan. 1, it would be worth $1,110 today.  Criteria: Of non-U.S. companies in the 3,017-stock FTSE All World Index, which includes developed and emerging markets. Excluded are stocks that didn\u2019t trade the entire year, and those under the majority control of a holding company. \u2022 Equity Mutual Funds Best: Matthews India Fund (MINDX), +59 percent Worst: Fidelity Select Energy Service Porfolio (FSESX), -22 percent India elected a new prime minister in May, and its main stock index jumped 30 percent this year. Matthews\u2019 top holding was Emami Ltd. (HMN), a maker beauty and health care products that\u2019s up 57 percent year-to-date. If you'd invested $10,000 in MINDX on Jan. 1, it would be worth $15,920 today.  The Fidelity portfolio of energy service stocks suffered, along with many other energy sector funds, in a year that the price of a barrel of oil went from $111 to $59 in six months. If you'd invested $10,000 in FSESX on Jan. 1, it would be worth $7,810 today.  Criteria: Of 1,441 U.S.-based equity mutual funds with assets of $500 million or more. Excluded are closed-end funds and those that rely on leverage. \u2022 Small-Cap Stock Funds Best: William Blair Emerging Markets Small Cap Growth Fund (WESNX), +12.6 percent Worst: Pacific Advisors Small Cap Value Fund (PASMX), -23 percent Small-cap stocks struggled to repeat their outstanding performance in 2012 and 2013, when the Russell 2000 index rose 57 percent. Still, about two of every three small-cap funds are up for the year. If you'd invested $10,000 on Jan. 1 in WESNX, it would be worth $11,260 today. But $10,000 in PASMX would have turned into $7,663. Criteria: Of 336 U.S.-based small-cap equity mutual funds with assets of at least $100 million and a median holding market capitalization of less than $3 billion.

They did well in 2014, reflecting expectations that inflation will remain low for quite a while. If you'd invested $10,000 in VEDTX on Jan. 1, it would be worth $14,506 today.  The AllianceBernstein fund is classified by Bloomberg as a fixed-income fund because its main goal is inflation protection. But while its top holding was Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, its other largest positions were equity shares of energy companies, which were hit hard by oil\u2019s drop. If you'd invested $10,000 in ACMTX on Jan. 1, it would be worth $8,852 today. Criteria: Of 776 open-ended fixed income mutual funds based in the U.S. with assets of $500 million or more. \u2022 Commodities Best: Coffee, +58 percent Worst: Brent Crude Oil, -45 percent Coffee prices soared after drought in Brazil, the world\u2019s largest grower and exporter of coffee beans. It was one of the few commodities that rose as world economic growth slowed, especially in Europe and emerging markets. Oil\u2019s slide was exacerbated by decisions by OPEC and Saudi Arabia not to cut production.  Criteria: Of 18 global commodities tracked by Bloomberg. \u2022 Exchange-Traded Funds Best: First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund (FBT), +52 percent Worst: Market Vectors Russia Small-Cap ETF (RSXJ), -52 percent Biotech companies were popular with investors in 2014. The First Trust fund\u2019s top holding was Incyte Corp., which primarily makes oncology drugs and is up 52 percent this year. If you'd invested $10,000 in FBT on Jan. 1, it would be worth $15,221 today.  Sanctions and the plunging price of oil put the Russian economy on life support. If you'd invested $10,000 in RSXJ on Jan. 1, it would be worth $4,793 today.  Criteria: Of 1,269 U.S.-based exchange-traded funds. Excluded are exchange-traded notes and ETFs that use leverage. \u2022 Currency Best: The U.S. Dollar Worst: The Russian Ruble -- or Bitcoin Every major currency fell against the U.S. dollar in 2014. The euro dropped 11 percent, the Japanese Yen fell almost 12 percent and the British pound dropped 5.6 percent. Of non-U.S. currencies, the Indian Rupee did best, down 2.4 percent against the dollar. Russia\u2019s central bank raised a key interest rate to 17 percent on Dec. 16, and even that failed to stop the Russian currency\u2019s plunge. The Ruble is ending 2014 down 45 percent against the dollar, shrinking a $10,000 investment on Jan. 1 into $5,513. But there\u2019s one currency that did worse in 2014, depending on whether you think virtual currencies are real money. A bitcoin has lost 58 percent of its value in U.S. dollars this year, and 72 percent since last November.

Moyal, a lawyer and advocate for the virtual currency, converted just over 2,000 shekels ($578) into about one bitcoin stored in his online wallet. Bitcoin ATMs are popping up in cities all over the world as a novelty for tech geeks, but it could turn out to be more than a gimmick in Israel. The country has a community of bitcoin enthusiasts that\'s about 10,000 strong, comprising the world\'s second-largest meet-up group for the virtual currency, according to Meni Rosenfeld, chairman of Israeli Bitcoin Association. Not bad for a country with a population about a 40th the size of the U.S. "Bitcoin is experiencing massive growth in Israel," said Nimrod Gruber, the chief executive officer at Bitbox, which operates the cash machine made by Robocoin. While many other countries are moving to regulate bitcoin, Israel hasn\'t yet set a cohesive policy. The Israel Tax Authority has deemed bitcoin to be a taxable financal asset, and the central bank has warned the public about risks associated with investing in the commodity. Tech investor Michael Eisenberg would like Israel to apply "sure but light" regulation on bitcoin that recognizes it as a currency and not as property, which is how the U.S. classifies it. He said Israel "stands to gain more as a country from the export of innovation engendered by bitcoin and virtual currencies than we stand to lose by having an alternative currency." Eisenberg, a venture capitalist for Benchmark and Aleph who invested in Wix.com, is optimistic that Israel could become "ground zero" for bitcoin, boosted in part by the country\'s high concentration of veterans who worked on cryptography in the army. The cash machine may help boost bitcoin\'s legitimacy, said Sam Ditzion, the CEO of Tremont Capital Group, an ATM industry consulting firm based in Boston. The introduction of ATMs in the late 1960s "changed forever the entire global economy because the infusion of currency into the global society was astronomical," he said. The bitcoin cash machine in Israel is located inside a boutique hotel and around the corner from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Users must enter a PIN code, mobile phone number, government identity card and palm print. Then they\'re able to deposit or withdraw money from their digital wallets in shekels, or access their bitcoins stored on the Internet by scanning a QR-code printout using their phones. Moyal, the lawyer who volunteered to try out the new ATM last week, has encouraged clients to pay for his legal services using bitcoin.

BlackRock Inc.\'s Larry Fink said leveraged ETFs could \u201cblow up\n\u201d the industry, even though they have microscopic assets and own less than 0.02 percent of the derivatives market. There\u2019s also been chatter about potential problems with ETFs that track illiquid assets, such as senior loans, if there\'s a run for the exits\n. A recent Ventured & Gained post looked at exchange-traded notes\n (ETNs) and some risks they pose. While there\'s no real evidence that ETFs pose a systemic risk, they can hold some pretty exotic stuff. And just because they trade like stocks, that doesn\u2019t mean they\'re all as liquid or straightforward as stocks. Perhaps the unique dangers of some ETFs should be flagged more prominently. One solution is "gating\n." That means requiring a separate set of disclosures for products that cross a certain line based on their use of leverage or derivatives. Makes sense; getting people to read those disclosures is another matter. And if you gate, where do you draw the line? Should commodity ETFs be gated? Hedge fund replication ETFs? Junk bonds ETFs? ETFs are nuanced, and their riskiness and complexity don\u2019t come from their holdings or regulatory structure alone.  Now, movie ratings -- there\'s a system everyone understands.  G  Anything that holds developed market stocks or bonds using standard market capitalization-weighted indexes. This is for straightforward ETFs with no complicated tax implications. Think Vanguard. Examples: iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV\n), Vanguard Short-Term Government Bond ETF (VGSH\n) PG  Any ETF that track stocks or bonds but uses an index that isn\'t weighted by market cap and that attempts to outperform the market, like smart-beta\n and actively managed\n ETFs. This category would also include physically backed commodity ETFs such as gold and silver.  Examples: Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP\n), SPDR Gold Shares (GLD\n) PG-13  ETFs that track slightly more exotic stocks or bonds that could pose liquidity concerns. ETFs that can frequently trade at a premium or discount to the value of their underlying assets, such as emerging markets and junk bond ETFs, go here. Specialized products that involve otherwise particularly tricky markets or tax consequences -- China\n, master-limited partnerships\n, mortgage REITs\n, currency- and interest-rate hedged ETFs and alternative strategies\n -- get a PG-13. Examples: iShares MSCI Frontier Markets 100 (FM\n), PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio (BKLN\n) R  Not suitable for retail investors. Any ETF that predominately holds derivatives such as swaps or futures. This includes all leveraged and inverse ETFs plus all single-commodity ETFs that hold futures contracts. Non-leveraged exchange-traded notes and volatility (VIX) products also fall in here. If a bitcoin ETF\n comes out, it would land here. Examples: Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3x Shares (NUGT\n), United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG\n) NC-17  Any leveraged ETN, in which investors get the double dose of leverage and credit risk. These are those rare products that make -- or should make -- even professional investors think twice.

So says the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which on Thursday announced it had\xa0filed and settled charges\xa0against a Bitcoin exchange for facilitating the trading of option contracts on its platform.\xa0 "In this order, the CFTC for the first time finds that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities," according to the press release. While market participants have long discussed whether Bitcoin could be defined as a commodity, and the CFTC has long pondered\xa0whether the cryptocurrency falls under its jurisdiction, the implications\xa0of this move are potentially numerous.\xa0 By this action, the CFTC asserts its authority to provide\xa0oversight of\xa0the trading\xa0of cryptocurrency\xa0futures and options, which will now be subject to the agency\'s regulations.\xa0In the event of wrongdoing, such as\xa0futures manipulation, the CFTC will be able to bring charges against bad actors. If a company wants to operate a trading platform for Bitcoin derivatives or futures, it will need to register as a swap execution facility or designated contract market, just like the CME Group. And Coinflip\u2014the target of the CFTC action\u2014is hardly the only company that provides a platform to trade Bitcoin derivatives or futures. \u201cWhile there is a lot of excitement surrounding Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets," said Aitan Goelman, the CFTC\'s director of enforcement, in a statement. Since Coinflip is not alone in providing a platform to trade Bitcoin derivatives or futures, Goelman\'s words imply that other unregulated exchanges could\xa0soon attract the attention of the CFTC. As such, the CFTC is bringing dealings in Bitcoin, long prized for its\xa0anonymity, into the light. While this could\xa0help clean up U.S. trading around the product, potentially helping to avoid a repeat of the Mt. Gox escapade, it is also likely to increase the cost of doing business. Coinflip consented to the order without admitting or denying any of its findings or conclusions. "The cease and desist was a fair settlement," Francisco Riordan,\xa0Coinflip\'s chief executive officer, said in response to a request for comment.

If it hits the market later this year, it will come a decade after the inception of the world\'s largest gold fund, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD\n      ). COIN was modeled on GLD and in some ways is trying to be a new generation\'s version of gold. The cyptocurrency would move closer to the mainstream in an exchange-traded fund wrapper. There\'s still no guarantee COIN will be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. There are more than a thousand prospectuses for ETFs sitting with the SEC, and hundreds of reserved tickers sitting with stock exchanges. And this approval would be the first of its kind -- a virtual asset. More on Cybersecurity: That said, the latest updates to the prospectus show two positive signs. First, the ticker, COIN, suggests the Winklevii are serious about making this about bitcoin and not about them. These are the people that gave an index tracking the price of bitcoin the name "Winkdex," so they might have chosen a gimmicky, self-referential ticker\n       like VOSS or WNKL for their ETF. Second, there were several very specific changes added to the risk section of the prospectus. That\'s worth noting, since plenty of ETFs are filed with the SEC but don\'t get updated (or reserve tickers). One change warns that core developers could stop maintaining the bitcoin protocol unless they\'re paid. Another notes that bitcoin is banned by the Bolivian central bank -- not a risk most people worry about, granted, but a risk. This looks a lot like somebody working closely with the SEC to dot their i\u2019s. The twins\' choice of lawyer, Kathleen Moriarty, works in COIN\'s favor. She\'s helped just about every issuer from iShares to WisdomTree bring new and different ETFs to market. She worked with the SEC and drafted the prospectus to get the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) launched in the early \u201890s. There\'s some talk that the Winklevoss ETF could be beaten to market. A company called SecondMarket runs a bitcoin private trust for accredited investors. ETF Trends reports that SecondMarket wants to create an over-the-counter listing and eventually an actual exchange listing.  An OTC listing shouldn\'t be much of a threat to COIN, since the vast majority of investors use a major stock exchange to buy and sell ETFs. And it would be very surprising if the SEC allowed SecondMarket to cut in line and not do all the legwork necessary for approval to list on a major exchange. If something like that happened, it would be like Facebook all over again for the twins. Rough.  To judge from the coverage of the filing over the past year, COIN is likely to make a cannonball-level splash if and when it launches. For it to make as big a splash as GLD, though, would take a minor miracle. GLD holds the ETF record for reaching $1 billion in assets the fastest. It did that in three days flat.

Purchases of cars from Germany\u2019s Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc, owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors Ltd., jumped the most in April among brands sold in Argentina. The sales were part of a 30 percent surge in car sales from a year earlier that was the biggest increase in 20 months, according to the Argentine Car Producers Association. While used-car prices rose in line with inflation last year, or about 25 percent, peso bonds tied to consumer prices fell 13 percent. The drop was the biggest in emerging markets. Car sales in Argentina increased by the most in almost two years last month as a ban on buying dollars made Argentines turn to vehicles to protect savings against the fastest inflation in the Western Hemisphere after Venezuela. Luxury models are becoming more attractive because they are imported at the official dollar rate, said Gonzalo Dalmasso, vehicle industry analyst at Buenos Aires research company Abeceb.com. Argentines with savings in dollars are able to purchase cars at half the cost by trading in the unofficial currency market. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of people buying high-end cars for the first time, trading Minis for middle of the market models,\u201d Ignacio Monteserin, a salesman at BMW\u2019s Mini Cooper dealership in Buenos Aires\u2019s Libertador Avenue, said. \u201cIt\u2019s become very convenient to own luxury cars in general because of the big gap in the exchange rates and you get to have a quality good that will preserve the value of your money with time.\u201d Car sales in Argentina surged 30 percent in April from a year earlier to 88,323 units, the fastest increase since August 2011 and the second-highest on record, according to a car association known as Adefa. Argentines have bought 1,588 BMWs so far this year, more than double the amount they purchased in the same period last year, according to Argentina\u2019s Car Dealers Association, or Acara. Jaguar and Land Rover sales increased by 200 percent and 278 percent respectively, the data show. Mini Cooper sales rose 54 percent in January to April from a year earlier. A Mini Coupe costs 194,000 pesos, or $37,072 at the official rate of 5.2380 per dollar. It costs $19,400 at the parallel rate at 10 pesos per dollar, cutting the price in half for Argentines who have savings in dollars and go to the black market to sell them for pesos. The same model in the U.S. costs $22,150. Argentines are buying cars, gold and even virtual currency such as bitcoin as they look for ways to preserve their savings as the peso is forecast to fall 17 percent this year. The peso in the illegal currency market, known as the blue market locally, weakened to a record 10.45 pesos per dollar last week. This means Argentines with peso salaries who buy dollars in the black market to protect against a weakening of the local currency and 25 percent inflation lose about half of their money. Inflation-linked bonds don\u2019t protect against rising prices because they\u2019re tied to the official price index, which at 10.6 percent is less than half the estimates of independent economists. They have dropped 3.4 percent this year after losing 13 percent in 2012. Argentina\u2019s official price index has been questioned by economists since 2007, when then-President Nestor Kirchner changed staff at the National Statistics Institute. The International Monetary Fund in February censured the country for not improving its inflation measurement. Argentina\u2019s dollar-denominated bonds aren\u2019t a better alternative as a U.S. legal dispute on repayment of the nation\u2019s defaulted debt caused average yields to soar to 13.92 percent, almost three times the average in emerging markets, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The notes have plunged 10 percent his year. The rate banks pay for 30-day deposits of more than 1 million pesos was 15.38 percent on May 10. \u201cThe government takes away their salaries and deposits through inflation and negative interest rates,\u201d said Jorge Remes Lenicov, a former Economy Minister from January 2002 to April 2002, when the country abandoned a decade-long peso peg to the dollar. The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed 20 basis points to 1,171 basis points at 1:27 p.m. in Buenos Airs, according to JPMorgan\u2019s EMBI Global index. The cost to insure Argentine debt against default within the next five years through credit default swaps rose 107 basis points to 2,770 basis points, according to data compiled by CMA Ltd. While inflation and a gap in the exchange rates is fueling sales, the same reasons are also deterring investment in the car industry, said Cristiano Rattazzi, President of Fiat Auto Argentina SA. \u201cThere are no certainties,\u201d Rattazzi, who is also head of the car makers association, said in a phone interview in Buenos Aires. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unstable environment. What if they devalue? What if there are multiple exchange rates? All of these questions and high inflation are putting a big break on investment.\u201d The Argentine government in March\xa02011 ordered car importers to match their imports with exports or investment of equal value to boost the trade surplus.

New Jersey lawmakers will vote on the issue on Feb. 26. If both houses approve, New Jersey will become the nation\u2019s third state to legalize Internet casino games, following Nevada and Delaware. The bill, which Governor Chris Christie recently vetoed in order to slip in a few provisions, is likely to pass. Amendments will include a 15 percent state tax of gross revenue on online gambling\u2014up from 10 percent\u2014and an increase in annual funding to fight compulsive gambling, from $150,000 to $250,000. Democratic leaders of New Jersey\u2019s Senate and Assembly have said they will accept these terms. At least one foreign online gambling company is already positioning itself to get in on the game. Isle of Man-based PokerStars, the world\u2019s leading online poker site, agreed in December to buy the struggling Atlantic Club Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. Purchasing the brick-and-mortar casino, which posted a $13.6 million operating loss through the first three quarters of 2012, would give the PokerStars brand more visibility as it tries to gain a foothold in the nascent U.S. online gambling market. For now, PokerStars is still awaiting approval of its gaming license application from the New Jersey authorities that regulate Atlantic City\u2019s $3 billion gambling industry. Some say the company will face tough scrutiny due to its tainted history, which goes back to April 15, 2011. On that day, known in the industry as Black Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice seized PokerStars and two other foreign-based online poker sites, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker, and shut down their domains. The Department of Justice also indicted 11 men in connection with the three sites, charging them with bank fraud, money laundering, and illegal gambling offenses. PokerStars managed to recover quickly, and in July acquired its beleaguered competitor Full Tilt. As part of the deal,\xa0PokerStars agreed to pay the U.S. government $547 million, to be\xa0used in part to reimburse former U.S. customers of Full Tilt, whose accounts have been frozen since Black Friday. In forging the settlement, PokerStars also cleared the way to\xa0reenter the U.S. market and begin taking online bets wherever Internet gambling is legalized. The caveat is that many states may only allow local\u2014not foreign\u2014companies to offer online gambling. In the wake of Black Friday, some people even speculated that the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s move was intended to clear out foreign companies that dominate online gambling, so U.S. casinos could come in and take over. By purchasing the Atlantic City casino, PokerStars would get its foot in the door. American online poker fans would surely welcome renewed access to the popular PokerStars and Full Tilt sites. Since Black Friday, some U.S. players have resorted to the more complicated process of gambling online using a crypto-currency called Bitcoin. Several even\xa0fled the country altogether, moving to such places as Costa Rica and Europe to maintain access to PokerStars. If the New Jersey vote goes through, as expected, PokerStars fans from across the country may soon have to travel only as far as the Garden State.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': u'Caroline Winter', 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-22/online-gambling-in-the-garden-state', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 2, 22, 19, 16, 27, 990000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Online Gambling in the Garden State'}, {'articleText': u' This was looking like the year that bitcoin would finally move beyond its sketchy reputation as an anonymous way to buy drugs and stolen credit cards. Banks had started to study how they could use the six-year-old digital currency to update the world\u2019s outdated money transfer mechanisms; and its price swings were becoming less extreme, making it less risky for ordinary folks to use. Then bitcoin\u2019s price inexplicably spiked 98\xa0percent in three weeks, touching $502 on Nov.\xa04, before dropping 20\xa0percent the next day. That\u2019s the kind of unruly fluctuation you might expect in a penny stock, not an invention that\u2019s been hyped as a trustworthy replacement for unreliable government-issued money. While it\u2019s impossible to determine exactly why the currency went wild, the fluctuation came just as people around the world were discovering a new use for bitcoin: investing in MMM, an online pyramid scheme that\u2019s promising returns as high as 100\xa0percent a month. Data from Internet tracker Alexa show traffic to MMM\u2019s websites taking off in October. More than 30,000 participants have posted testimonials on YouTube, mainly from China, the Philippines, and South Africa. MMM was founded by Sergei Mavrodi, a Russian who\u2019s been running variations of it since the country\u2019s Wild West days of privatization. He evaded prosecution for a decade, at one point running for Parliament to gain immunity and winning, before serving four and a half years for fraud. His latest pitch: convert your bitcoins to another online currency called mavros and see your account balance grow. \u201cThe financial apocalypse is inevitable,\u201d he said in a video posted on Nov.\xa08. \u201cTogether we change the world!\u201d Mavrodi has said that he doesn\u2019t violate any laws or take money for himself. Bitcoin proponents say they doubt Mavrodi\u2019s scheme is big enough to move the exchange rate, with more than $100\xa0million of the digital currency bought and sold every day. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the only thing driving demand for bitcoin,\u201d says Gil Luria, an analyst for Wedbush Securities who tracks the currency. Of course, a lot of the other uses are also illicit. A 33-year-old in Texas pleaded guilty in September to running a different Ponzi scheme that at one point controlled 7\xa0percent of all bitcoins. Hackers who take control of private computers and demand ransom from their owners, like those behind the CryptoLocker malware, often ask to be paid in bitcoin. And the trade in online narcotics is thriving in new marketplaces such as Agora and Middle Earth Marketplace, even after the FBI busted the biggest one, Silk Road, in 2013, and its successor, Silk Road 2.0, the next year. Scammers seem to be the biggest bitcoin users partly because of the volatility: Few others are ready to conduct their business in a currency that can lose a quarter of its value overnight. While retailers and other consumer companies like to get free publicity by saying they accept bitcoin, most instantly convert payments into dollars. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have a stable value, it\u2019s probably not going to survive,\u201d Eugene Fama, the Nobel prize-winning economist, said on a recent podcast. Looking back, bitcoin seems almost designed to encourage speculation. It initially was doled out in tiny amounts to \u201cminers,\u201d the people who contributed computing capacity to power the bitcoin network. Some of those early adopters got rich in 2011 when the website Gawker publicized Silk Road, and the price of a bitcoin went from $1 to $32. The chatter around newly minted bitcoin millionaires attracted speculators. The price topped $1,000 in 2013, then collapsed when one of the biggest exchanges, Mt. Gox, disclosed that $480\xa0million in bitcoin had mysteriously disappeared and filed for bankruptcy. \u201cBlockchain is like any other technology. If it is cheaper, effective, works, and secure, then we are going to use it.\u201d \u2014Jamie Dimon Bitcoin evangelists say it will come into its own as more people start using it to buy stuff, rather than just holding on to it, hoping to make a killing. To execute a large volume of transactions, each bitcoin would have to be worth a significant amount in dollar terms, because the supply is fixed. Wedbush\u2019s Luria projects bitcoin will be used in 1\xa0percent or 2\xa0percent of online transactions within five years, about 80 times more than today. To handle that level of activity, which would amount to $126\xa0billion in transfers a year, the price would have to rise to $1,429, he says. One threat to bitcoin is that banks could render it superfluous by co-opting the blockchain, its main innovation. That\u2019s the encrypted database, distributed among users\u2019 computers, enabling transactions to be recorded without the help of a central authority. If big companies set up distributed databases to transfer dollars or euros quickly and cheaply enough, there\u2019d be no need for digital currencies. \u201cBlockchain is like any other technology,\u201d JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in November at the Fortune Global Forum. \u201cIf it is cheaper, effective, works, and secure, then we are going to use it.\u201d Meanwhile, the currency seems destined to remain the stuff that get-rich-quick dreams are made of. Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of the bitcoin exchange Coinbase, believes in the currency\u2019s future. For now, though, he says, \u201cMost people who are buying and selling bitcoin don\u2019t fully understand it. They have it ingrained in their heads that it\u2019s just going to keep going up.\u201d \u2014With Olga Kharif The bottom line: Bitcoin\u2019s three-week 98 percent spike hurts its prospects for becoming a currency for ordinary transactions. \xa0', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/ZekeFaux', 'name': u'Zeke Faux', 'twitterhandle': u'ZekeFaux'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/bitcoin-can-t-escape-the-dark-side-of-the-internet', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 12, 20, 51, 22, 282000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Can\u2019t Keep It Chill'}, {'articleText': u'  BTC China, the nation\u2019s largest Bitcoin operator, stopped accepting customer deposits amid a central bank clampdown on use of the digital currency, sending prices plunging as much as 35 percent. YeePay, a third-party payment provider, gave notice today that it would no longer provide deposit services to the company, Bobby Lee, BTC China\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a phone interview. TenPay, a payment provider owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd., also halted business, Lee said.

Chinese central bank officials told third-party payment service providers to stop offering clearing services to online Bitcoin exchanges, China Business News reported yesterday. The newspaper is affiliated with the Shanghai government. Companies currently offering services must end them by the Chinese New Year, a weeklong holiday that begins on Jan. 31, the newspaper cited Zhou Jinhuang, deputy director of payment clearance at the People\u2019s Bank of China, as saying at a meeting with more than 10 third-party payment service providers. Bitcoin withdrawals are unaffected by today\u2019s announcement, according to BTC China\u2019s microblog. \u201cWe\u2019ve suspended customer deposits,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt is unfortunate but we apologize for that inconvenience.\u201d People can\u2019t transfer money into BTC China any more, said an YeePay employee who answered the company\u2019s customer service hotline, declining to give her name. PBOC said on Dec. 5 that financial institutions and payment companies can\u2019t give pricing in Bitcoin, buy and sell the virtual currency or insure Bitcoin-linked products. \u201cThe PBOC statement on Dec. 5 was somewhat vague and there is more clarity now,\u201d Zennon Kapron, managing director of financial consultancy Kapronasia, said in an interview yesterday in Shanghai. \u201cThe way it\u2019s reading now is that after the Chinese New Year, you won\u2019t be able to get your money off the platforms.\u201d The value of Bitcoin, which is not regulated by any country or banking authority, soared 80-fold from a year ago and traded at $1,000 apiece on Dec. 2 on BitStamp, an Internet-based exchange where Bitcoins are traded for dollars, euros and other currencies. Prices fell to $479.90 at 6:09 p.m. The currency has rallied on growing interest from investors, while merchants are starting to accept Bitcoins and U.S. officials have told lawmakers such payments could be a legitimate means of exchange.

Flashing cash and smartphones, men make trades worth thousands of dollars in a nook of the park they call Satoshi Square. The scene is like an open-air trading floor, and indeed, participants liken themselves to the men who hatched New York\u2019s first stock exchange under a buttonwood tree in 1792. Similar gatherings have taken place in London, and an inaugural one will take place in Toronto next week. What gives? While the economic appeal of Bitcoin is easy to understand\u2014it\u2019s not tethered to a central bank and can be traded at low or zero cost\u2014it\u2019s not clear if the currency has a place in everyday life. To get a better idea, I paid $96 this week to buy my first Bitcoin and went to Satoshi Square. Here\u2019s a summary of what I saw, some pictures, and three takeaways (if you need to catch up on what Bitcoin is, see our primer ). The first Bitcoin buy-up in Union Square took place in May, and now they occur every Monday from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. near the Abe Lincoln statue at the north end of the park. By 6 p.m., about 20 people, all men, had gathered to trade Bitcoins in the 95 degree heat and swap stories about software. People called out sale prices, and others, clutching envelopes of $100 bills, accepted. In 30 minutes, I saw around seven transactions, the largest for $1,500. None involved merchandise\u2014it was all greenbacks for Bitcoins. I had hoped to spend my new Bitcoin on beer or a farmer\u2019s pie. No luck. (It turns out I couldn\u2019t have spent it even if someone at Satoshi Square was selling pie\u2014the Bitcoin I bought earlier in the day took three days to show up in my digital wallet). The traders in the square used no single method for exchange: Some pulled out phones to scan Bitcoin addresses embedded in QR codes, others used laptops or tablets, and one man used a gift card he obtained months ago at a Bitcoin event in California. The vibe at Satoshi Square was a cross between a stock exchange, a religious revival, and buying weed in the park. There was a lust for money tinged with a higher ideal. Here\u2019s three totally subjective takeaways from the whole affair: \nBitcoin won\u2019t be used in everyday commerce soon (if ever)\n Every few weeks you hear a story about a cupcake store or a bar that now accepts Bitcoins. I\u2019ve always suspected these stories are a marketing ploy cooked up by a business seeking media attention. Now I know for sure. The reason is that the currency requires too much friction to be practical. Consider my experience of what it took to create a digital wallet and to put Bitcoins in it\u2014and I chose the simplest path. I used Coinbase because it\u2019s the easiest on-ramp to the Bitcoin world\u2014but look what I had to do: Disclose my bank account information, enable 2-factor authentication by sharing my cell number, and then wait three days. (The traders at Satoshi Square, meanwhile, use even more complicated wallet tools than Coinbase.) All this is fine for a certain type of person. Most people, however, are too lazy, cautious, or tech-averse to engage in this type of rigamarole. And before you write me off as a skeptic, consider Google: There\u2019s a reason the search giant, despite spending tens of millions, can\u2019t persuade people to pay for things with their phones. People thinks it\u2019s simpler to swipe a credit card or hand over a $20 bill than to pay with some phone-based thing called Google Wallet (most people also believe it\u2019s safer). If giant Google\u2014whose Wallet is easy compared with Coinbase\u2014can\u2019t figure out the payment thing, how likely is it that anyone will use Bitcoin to buy pies in New York? Cash is still king, in accounting and on the street. \nOnly three types of people care about Bitcoin\n My conversations at Satoshi Square confirmed my earlier impressions that there are basically three types of Bitcoiners: political idealists, geeks, and people who want to get stinking rich. The first group include libertarians who worry the Federal Reserve and other central banks will debase the national currency and that Bitcoin, like gold, is an independent store of value. Others in this group just like the idea of a borderless, semi-anonymous form of money based on person-to-person transactions. Another group attracted to Bitcoin are computer and math savants who relish the beauty of the Bitcoinblockchain and its unbreakable encryption mechanism. This group includes software developers who want to build cool features to use or enhance the currency (and perhaps make some extra cash). The third type of Bitcoin enthusiasts are all about the money. These include bankers, hustlers, and executives who just like the trading game\u2014but also some unsavory types who hope to induce and profit from Bitcoin bubbles or use the currency for criminal ends. Overall, this is a problem: The people who care about Bitcoin are nearly all male (with some prominent exceptions) and represent just a tiny sliver of the population. You could say the same thing, of course, about people who trade oil or hog or yen futures\u2014the difference is that everyone uses those things, but almost no one uses Bitcoin. The upshot is that, in five years, we\u2019re likely to look back on Bitcoin as a fad or a hobby, while treating the currency itself as worthless computer debris. Unless, that is, it catches on with a fourth group. \nIf Bitcoin has a future, it depends on the money men\n In the best piece yet written on the Bitcoin phenomenon, the Financial Times in June described a growing schism between the idealists and the money men. The former don\u2019t want to sell out to any government, but the guys with the money believe that playing nice with Uncle Sam and his money laundering rules is the way to go. These money men include respected venture capitalist Fred Wilson, whose firm is an investor in Coinbase and who gave Bitcoin a recent shout-out on his blog. The FT says Wilson and his VC crew are treating the currency as a \u201cjust in case\u201d investment\u2014and that\u2019s a good bet, considering the money they\u2019ve put into Coinbase is small beer for these guys. But the speculation doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin won\u2019t have traction in the long run. Even though typical Americans won\u2019t (and probably never will) buy Bitcoin, there are plenty of people in other countries who would. As Silicon Valley executive Wences Caseres explained at a GigaOM meetup this spring, governments in such places as Argentina have repeatedly wiped out the savings of ordinary people through economic mismanagement. Many of these people would jump at the chance to buy Bitcoin\u2014as an alternative currency that won\u2019t deflate and that is hard for the government to confiscate. It is in this role, for now, that Bitcoin has the greatest opportunity to flourish: as a currency traded through exchanges that are acceptable to America\u2019s financial regulators and that can become an established part of the world\u2019s foreign exchange and remittance economy. \nAlso from GigaOM\n Microsoft Kills Its Own Virtual Currency (Sorta) in Xbox Points (subscription required) \nBallmer\u2019s Million Server Claim Dosn\u2019t Seem So Crazy\n \nWhy WhatsApp\u2019s New Subscription Model Makes Perfect Sense\n \nWhy Carriers Are Rolling Out Upgrade Plans When We\u2019re Not Upgrading Our Smartphones\n \nNetflix Hits It Big with Emmy Nominations for House of Cards and Arrested Development\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-18/bitcoins-open-air-trading-floor', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 18, 18, 19, 16, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Bitcoin's Open-Air Trading Floor"}, {'articleText': u'  The central bank of Estonia, where Swedish banks dominate the lending market, urged consumers to steer clear of Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies, warning such software could prove to be little more than a \u201cPonzi scheme.\u201d Bitcoin \u201cis a problematic scheme,\u201d Mihkel Nommela, head of the Estonian central bank\u2019s payment and settlement systems department, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. \u201cAll risks are assumed by the user, who has no one to turn to for help.\u201d Regulators and banks are escalating warnings against Bitcoin, and other digital currencies, amid concern such software lends itself to financial crime. Bitcoin enthusiasts suffered a blow this week when it emerged Charlie Shrem, vice chairman of Bitcoin Foundation, was charged in the U.S. for attempting to sell Bitcoins to narcotics traffickers. SEB AB, the largest Nordic currency trader and the second-biggest bank in the Baltic region, is rejecting requests from clients seeking to set up accounts to manage Bitcoin. No Nordic regulator recognizes the software as money and Nordea Bank AB, Scandinavia\u2019s biggest bank, is telling clients to think twice before touching Bitcoin. \u201cAll in all, virtual currency schemes are an innovation that deserves some caution, given the lack of any guarantees and responsible parties to back them in the longer term or evidence that this isn\u2019t just a Ponzi scheme,\u201d said Nommela. Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, which joined the euro this year, got burned in 2008 as a real estate boom turned to bust and a global credit freeze hobbled exports. The three nations suffered the deepest recessions in Europe at the time, with Latvia\u2019s economy contracting by more than a fifth in 2008-2009. The experience has underscored resolve among regulators in the region to protect financial markets from products that display outsized value shifts. The Estonian finance ministry, responsible for regulation, and the central bank in Lithuania haven\u2019t yet taken any steps to regulate virtual currencies. The central bank of Lithuania today issued a statement urging consumers \u201cto be extremely cautious\u201d with virtual currencies. \u201cSuch currencies are created and managed by people or groups that nobody supervises,\u201d Vilius Sapoka, director of the Financial Services and Markets Supervision Department at the bank, said in the statement. \u201cSo there\u2019s a very big risk that the \u2018creators\u2019 could disappear with people\u2019s money.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s price has fluctuated according to the newsflow around its safety and popularity. It topped $1,000 for the first time in November, as speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. The price has since dropped more than 20 percent, according to Bitstamp, one of the more active online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars and other currencies. One Bitcoin cost about $15 a year ago. Bitcoin supporters say they are building a system to move money across the Internet securely and at a lower cost than existing wire transfers, bank debits or remittances. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions. It has gained traction with merchants selling everything from Sacramento Kings basketball tickets to kitchen mixers on Overstock.com. The software\u2019s defenders say Bitcoin is safer than currencies backed by governments, arguing that virtual payment systems can\u2019t be steered by political motives. \u201cLegacy currencies like euros or dollars are dependent on promises of central banks and politicians,\u201d Martti Malmi, a software developer with Finnish firm SC5, who says he\u2019s the first Bitcoin developer after Nakamoto and worked with the program in 2009-2011, said by e-mail. \u201cI would advise caution in holding them more than you can afford to lose.\u201d In Sweden, consumers have experienced firsthand some of the risks associated with using Bitcoin. This month Sweden\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchange, Kapiton, was reported to the police and the National Board for Consumer Disputes after a number of users alleged their money had disappeared. Kapiton\u2019s founder -- referred to on the website only as Sebastian -- published a statement on Jan. 18 apologizing for \u201crecent problems\u201d and assuring users that no client assets had disappeared. The site is working to match orders with accounts, Sebastian said. Shrem resigned from the board of Bitcoin Foundation on Jan. 28 after he was charged with conspiring to launder $1 million in the virtual currency, the latest allegations tied to the illicit online bazaar Silk Road. According to Nommela, Estonia\u2019s central bank is also concerned that a Bitcoin account holder \u201ccan quickly lose it if for example his or her computer lacks the necessary anti-virus software or recovery options.\u201d As the birthplace of Skype, Estonia has traditionally been open to technological innovations. Citizens are at home with online services, with 95 percent of the country\u2019s 2013 tax declarations filed electronically. Some 85 percent use online banking, compared with the European Union average of 48 percent, according to a Eurobarometer study in 2012. \u201cThere are grounds to assume that the use of virtual money schemes will expand in Estonia as well,\u201d Nommela said. \u201cThus the central bank keeps its attention on such schemes.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-30/bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-worry-sparks-estonia-central-bank-caution', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 31, 15, 24, 2, 673000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin \u2018Ponzi\u2019 Concern Sparks Warning From Estonia Bank'}, {'articleText': u'  SEB AB, the largest Nordic foreign currency trader, is rejecting requests from clients seeking to set up accounts to manage Bitcoin amid concern the software could be used to aid crime.

The comments come as Bitcoin Foundation Vice Chairman Charlie Shrem was charged by the U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara for allegedly attempting to sell Bitcoins to narcotics traffickers. Both Sweden\u2019s government and the European Banking Authority have warned of the risks associated with Bitcoin as a potential vehicle for money laundering. Scandinavian regulators, which set some of the world\u2019s strictest banking standards, have been united in airing their skepticism toward Bitcoin and its competitors. No authority in the region recognizes Bitcoin as a form of money. Yet as consumers and businesses continue using the virtual payment system, Scandinavia\u2019s biggest banks are now starting to react. \u201cWe have received requests from companies that want to open accounts to manage Bitcoin,\u201d and \u201cwe have so far declined,\u201d Andersson said. \u201cWhen we make decisions regarding corporate customers, we need to understand the business, there needs to be a sustainable business plan and routines for following money laundering rules.\u201d SEB isn\u2019t alone in sounding the alarm. Nordea Bank AB, Scandinavia\u2019s biggest bank, is warning clients to think twice before touching Bitcoin. The bank doesn\u2019t engage in transactions or services involving Bitcoin and is \u201cadvising its customers of the risks connected to Bitcoin,\u201d said Erik Durhan, a spokesman for Nordea. \u201cIt is an experimental digital currency\u201d that \u201cis not subject to regulation and monitoring like traditional payment systems.\u201d Since its 2008 creation, Bitcoin has challenged regulators and legislators, who are struggling to keep up as people use the software to pay for everything from university tuition to cups of coffee to senate campaign donations in the U.S. Sweden\u2019s government has warned that Bitcoin could lend itself to money laundering or even to financing terrorism. The nation\u2019s tax authority is set to reject Bitcoin as a currency and instead treat it as art. Across the Nordic region, where stable AAA governments have been at the forefront in designing regulation to protect banks from future crises, authorities are now among the first to take a stand on Bitcoin. In Norway, the tax department has decided to label it a taxable asset. Finland plans to treat it as a commodity while Danish regulators are drafting a proposal for lawmakers in an effort to protect consumers and businesses. Still, Nordic regulators agree they can\u2019t stop people using Bitcoin. Denmark\u2019s Financial Supervisory Authority says the spread of digital currencies is inevitable and regulators need to race to ensure they\u2019re ready. \u201cVirtual currencies are one of many different innovations and the Riksbank generally welcomes innovations that can make the payment system both safer and more efficient and meet new needs that may arise over time,\u201d Bjoern Segendorff, an adviser at the Swedish central bank\u2019s department for financial stability, said in a phone interview. \u201cThere are of course risks that we need to evaluate on a case-to-case basis.\u201d In the Baltic region, where Sweden\u2019s banks dominate the lending market, authorities are also issuing Bitcoin warnings. \u201cVirtual currency schemes are an innovation that deserves to be treated with some caution,\u201d Mihkel Nommela, head of the Estonian central bank\u2019s payment and settlement systems department, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. Ultimately, there are no \u201cguarantees that this isn\u2019t just a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he said. At Swedbank AB, the largest bank in the Baltic countries, there are so far \u201cno general restrictions for companies dealing with Bitcoin to opening an account in the bank,\u201d said Anna Sundblad, a spokeswoman for the bank. Still, Swedbank sees \u201crisks attached to this, not least as regards money laundering, and therefore we evaluate every business proposal very carefully\u201d and \u201care following developments closely in order to reconsider the decision or take action if needed.\u201d Svenska Handelsbanken AB, Europe\u2019s best-capitalized bank, says it will treat Bitcoin like any other product. \u201cThe local Handelsbanken branch always makes a commercial evaluation of the companies that want to become customers,\u201d said Henrik Westman, a spokesman for the lender. The bank is open to new operations provided they \u201cfollow the existing rules and regulation,\u201d Westman said. This month Sweden\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchange, Kapiton, was reported to the police and the National Board for Consumer Disputes after a number of users alleged their money had disappeared. Kapiton\u2019s founder -- referred to on the website only as Sebastian -- published a statement on Jan. 18 apologizing for \u201crecent problems\u201d and assuring users that no client assets had disappeared. The site is working to match orders with accounts, Sebastian said. Two men tied to the illicit online market Silk Road, including Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s Shrem, were charged yesterday in a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court. Shrem, chief executive of a Bitcoin exchange, \u201cpersonally bought drugs\u201d on the Silk Road site, according to the complaint. Arrested Jan. 26 at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Shrem was \u201cfully aware\u201d Silk Road was a venue for drug trafficking, prosecutors said. Earlier this month, about 29,600 Bitcoins were seized from Silk Road, an online market that sold drugs and hacking services, Bharara said. Bitcoin\u2019s price has fluctuated according to the newsflow around its safety and popularity. It topped $1,000 for the first time in November, as speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. The price has since dropped to about $760 on Bitstamp, one of the more active online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars and other currencies. One Bitcoin cost about $15 a year ago. Bitcoin enthusiasts say they are building a system to move money across the Internet securely and at a lower cost than existing wire transfers, bank debits or remittances. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer, or group of programmers, known as Satoshi Nakamoto. There are 21\xa0million possible Bitcoins available that can be mined by a peer-to-peer network harnessing computers to complete complicated mathematical calculations. About 12.2 million units are currently in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts.com. Segendorff at Sweden\u2019s central bank said Bitcoin will probably need to become part of the regulatory framework if its popularity continues to grow. \u201cPersonally, I believe that any unregulated virtual currency that eventually starts being used a lot cannot remain unregulated,\u201d he said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-27/bitcoin-crime-risk-sparks-warning-at-biggest-nordic-forex-trader', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 28, 12, 19, 36, 959000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Crime Risk Sparks Warning at Top Nordic Forex Bank'}, {'articleText': u'  Newsweek magazine said it stands by reporter Leah McGrath Goodman\u2019s story identifying a 64-year-old physicist as the founder of Bitcoin, despite the man\u2019s denial of any role in the digital currency. \u201cMs. Goodman\u2019s research was conducted under the same high editorial and ethical standards that have guided Newsweek for more than 80 years,\u201d the magazine said today on its website. \u201cNewsweek stands strongly behind Ms. Goodman and her article.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-07/newsweek-stands-by-story-identifying-physicist-as-bitcoin-maker', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 7, 17, 51, 36, 472000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Newsweek Stands by Story Identifying Physicist as Bitcoin Maker'}, {'articleText': u'  California and New York, home to Silicon Valley and Wall Street, are preparing to write rules of the road for entrepreneurs driving a surge of interest in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The outcome could determine how big a threat Bitcoin poses to established payment companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Visa Inc. as well as where venture capital and talent converge to form a geographic hub for U.S. startups. \u201cIf a state becomes Bitcoin-friendly, it will see a huge increase in companies,\u201d said Adam Ettinger, an attorney with San Francisco-based Strategic Counsel Corp., which advises technology investors. \u201cThat will mean the brightest minds working on some of the most innovative payment technology we\u2019ve seen in awhile.\u201d Bitcoin, a five-year-old protocol for issuing and moving money across the Internet, has gained traction with merchants selling everything from Sacramento Kings basketball tickets to kitchen mixers on Overstock.com. Venture capitalists see promise in it as an alternative to the global payment system currently dominated by companies including Visa, Western Union Co. and large banks. Bitcoin\u2019s legal status has been uncertain. In March, the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which polices money laundering, said virtual-currency firms may be regulated as money transmitters. The move set off the race among states, which license such firms, to determine if and how their laws apply. Regulators and law enforcers have expressed concern that Bitcoin could facilitate money laundering and sales of drugs and other illegal goods. Federal prosecutors in New York today indicted the head of a digital currency exchange company on charges of conspiring to launder more than $1 million in Bitcoin tied to Silk Road, an online drug bazaar. Charlie Shrem, the chief executive officer of BitInstant, is also the vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, the group that oversees the currency\u2019s software protocols and lobbies regulators. In October, U.S. authorities shut down Silk Road and arrested its operator for hosting illegal transactions. Stephanie Newberg, president of the Money Transmitter Regulators Association, a group of state officials, said Bitcoin will dominate her association\u2019s agenda precisely because its legal status is unclear. \u201cSome states have statutes that are broad enough to do it immediately,\u201d said Newberg, who is also deputy commissioner of banking in Texas. \u201cOther states don\u2019t. It\u2019s a state-by-state question.\u201d JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said he expects that Bitcoin will be less of a threat once regulators intervene. Bitcoin \u201cwill eventually be made as a payment system, I think, to follow the same standards as the other payment systems, and that will probably be the end of them,\u201d Dimon said Jan. 23 in an interview on CNBC. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions. Successful virtual currency startups will have to commit to being regulated by the states, said Fred Ehrsam, chief executive of Coinbase in San Francisco, a company that helps users buy and sell Bitcoin. \u201cWe think California and New York will set the tone for everything else,\u201d Ehrsam said. \u201cWhen that tone is established, we\u2019re ready to hand in licensing applications immediately.\u201d California and New York have so far adopted different approaches. New York\u2019s superintendent of financial services, Benjamin Lawsky, moved publicly against Bitcoin startups last year, issuing subpoenas for information on their business, a move the companies complain has forced them to spend seed capital on lawyers. Tomorrow Lawsky is scheduled to convene two days of public hearings to consider whether New York should establish what he has called a \u201cBitLicense.\u201d By contrast, officials in California have been quietly meeting with lawyers and compliance experts for advice before making public moves, according to a person advising Bitcoin companies who asked not to be identified because the meetings were private. Patrick Murck, general counsel of the Seattle-based Bitcoin Foundation, a group that promotes the use of digital currency, pointedly complimented California on its approach during a U.S. congressional hearing. \u201cWe believe a healthy and respectful dialogue between key stakeholders will help ensure that the substantial benefits of the digital economy are met, while mitigating many of the risks,\u201d Murck said at the hearing on Nov. 18. California law requires companies that transmit monetary value to obtain licenses from its Department of Business Oversight, said Alana Golden, a spokeswoman. Its lawyers are currently weighing whether companies that only transmit a digital currency fall under this definition, Golden said. While Bitcoin-related businesses are free to apply for a money transmitter license, Golden cautioned against it. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re not advising the virtual currency companies to apply for licenses. There\u2019s too much in flux now,\u201d Golden said. \u201cWe advise businesses to contact the department to discuss the California Money Transmission act and how the law may apply to them.\u201d New York is home to Union Square Ventures, which has invested in Bitcoin startups, and Barry Silbert, the chief executive of SecondMarket, who runs a personal fund devoted to virtual currency companies. California, and in particular Silicon Valley, is home to many virtual currency startups as well as the largest investment to date, $25 million, in Ehrsam\u2019s Coinbase. Andreessen Horowitz, the Palo Alto-based venture capital firm that led the investment, has said it wants to use Bitcoin to build a new payments system. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz. New York law requires a license to receive a customer\u2019s money for transmission, as a company such as Western Union might do. It also requires a license to issue payment instruments, such as money orders. Marco Santori, a lawyer with Nesenoff & Miltenberg LLP in New York who advises virtual-currency startups, said companies that receive money from a customer to convert into Bitcoin may not fall under that law, since the funds aren\u2019t being transmitted. Since \u201cmoney\u201d isn\u2019t defined in the law, New York may not have jurisdiction, he said. \u201cThese laws are nowhere near what they\u2019d need to be to regulate Bitcoin businesses,\u201d Santori said. As a result, Lawsky\u2019s department is considering use of its \u201cgap authority\u201d to regulate virtual currencies, according to a person briefed on the discussions. This authority, included in the law that created the department in 2011, allows it to regulate financial services not otherwise covered by state law. Companies including New York-based Union Square Ventures have met with staff for Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, to press their case for creating a Bitcoin-friendly regulatory environment, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Union Square, headed by Fred Wilson, contributed $51,500 to Democratic candidates and organizations in the 2012 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Lawsky, who was previously chief counsel to Schumer, has said he is mindful of the effects of regulation on what could be an emerging industry. \u201cWe want New York to be a place where these companies are coming and thriving, and at the same time, put in the rules of the road and protections to ensure we don\u2019t have money laundering,\u201d Lawsky told CNBC on Jan. 10.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-27/new-york-duels-california-to-write-bitcoin-rules', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 28, 1, 18, 17, 259000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'New York Vying With California to Write Bitcoin Rules'}, {'articleText': u'  Robocoin Technologies, the company that opened the world\u2019s first Bitcoin automated teller machine, plans to set up a second one in Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post reported, citing Chief Executive Jordan Kelley. An ATM for the virtual currency may be ready in the Chinese city by the end of this month, the newspaper said, citing Kelley in an interview. Robocoin will partner with local businessmen in Hong Kong, the newspaper said, without providing names. Robocoin opened the first Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver in October and transactions exceeded C$1 million ($940,000) within the first month of opening, the SCMP said. At the Vancouver ATM, users can deposit cash in exchange for Bitcoins to be put into an online wallet, or withdraw cash from the machine in exchange for Bitcoins, according to Robocoin\u2019s website. The company chose Hong Kong because of enthusiasm in Asia for Bitcoin and the city\u2019s strong links to Vancouver, the SCMP said. The Hong Kong government takes a \u201cprogressive approach\u201d to Bitcoin technology, the newspaper quoted Kelley saying. Bitcoin currently trades at about $908 on the Mt.Gox exchange, up from about $13 a year ago. Bitcoin plunged against the yuan on Dec. 18 after China\u2019s largest online market for the virtual currency stopped accepting Bitcoin deposits. Bitcoin fell as much as 49 percent to 2,011 yuan that day on BTC China. BTC China\u2019s decision to stop taking deposits followed a move by China\u2019s central bank to bar financial institutions and payment companies from handling Bitcoin transactions. Norway said last month it won\u2019t recognize Bitcoin as legal tender and will impose a capital gains tax. Bitcoin has since rebounded in China and trades at about 5,000 yuan today on BTC China. Introduced five years ago by a programmer, or group of programmers, going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoins exist as software and can potentially reduce banking transaction fees, making it an attractive option for trading via the Web or in stores. Bitcoins are being used to pay for everything from Gummi bears and digital cameras to Tesla electric cars on the Web, with more than 12 million in circulation. The Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has said that Bitcoin businesses may be considered money transmitters for the purpose of complying with anti-money laundering laws.

BitOcean and Atlas will invest $1 million worth of bitcoins to start an exchange platform in Japan by August, Nan Xiaoning, the Beijing-based founder and chief executive officer of BitOcean, said in an interview today. Virtual currencies have come under increased scrutiny from regulators and prosecutors around the globe. The European Commission signaled on July 4 it would try to impose rules on virtual currencies such as bitcoin after the bloc\u2019s banking regulator ordered lenders to shun them. Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchanges, in February sought court protection in Japan after losing 850,000 bitcoins, then valued at about $473 million. The company later found 200,000 in an old-format digital wallet. \u201cMt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy left a big void in the bitcoin trading market and we hope to fill that gap,\u201d Nan said. Should BitOcean\u2019s proposal to buy Mt. Gox\u2019s assets be successful, current debtors of Mt. Gox would have the option of withdrawing their bitcoins or owning up to 49 percent in the new partnership, named BitOcean Japan, Nan said. All the members of BitOcean Japan are all creditors of Mt. Gox, according to the company\u2019s website. BitOcean, which makes bitcoin automated teller machines, was started in 2013 and currently has 20 employees in China and Japan, Nan said. Atlas ATS is a trading platform for digital currencies which is used by Wall Street trading firms, according to its website. Mt. Gox has suffered from bad management and security worries, and the partners would improve on this area by using the trading platform technology for crypto-currencies provided by Atlas, which has proven to be secure, Nan said.

His plan: Dock a cruise ship flying an Indian flag off the coast of Miami. Stock the ship with versions of Sovaldi sold in India for $83,000 less than the U.S. retail price for 12 weeks of treatment. Ferry U.S. patients to the boat and send them home with the potentially life-saving medicines at a huge discount. The only wrinkle in his plan wasn\u2019t the absurdity of a pharmacy benefit manager manning and operating a cruise ship full of drugs from India. The problem, after doing some quick research into the idea, was that it would probably violate U.S. drug re-importation laws that limit the value of drugs brought into the country to $1,500 -- the price of one and a half Sovaldi tablets in the U.S., said Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, who came up with the idea. \u201cI was trying to be as creative as possible,\u201d Miller said in an interview. \u201cThis is what the market is demanding, this level of creativity that almost borders on the ridiculous.\u201d Miller quickly dropped the drug boat scheme, but he says he is still searching for creative ways to save money on the $84,000 Sovaldi, which Express Scripts stopped covering for many patients this year because of the cost. He isn\u2019t alone. A cottage industry of drug distributors, medical tourism agencies and consultants is emerging to offer patients in the U.S. and other developed countries cheap copies of Sovaldi from countries where it is sold for 1 percent of the U.S. price. Patients in the U.S. and Europe have struggled to get access to the drug after insurers and governments limited its use to the sickest patients to control costs, leaving the rest waiting while the virus attacks and scars their liver. Employers have warned that the cost of covering the drug could be a financial catastrophe. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, for instance, said it spent almost $3 million on Sovaldi last year for its employees and retirees, according to a lawsuit it filed against Gilead over the price. Meanwhile, a group of generic drugmakers are licensed to sell copies of Sovaldi in 91 mostly low-income countries, and this year began selling it in India for about $900 for a 12-week regimen under an agreement with Gilead intended to help patients in the poorest countries get access to the medication. While Americans have crossed the border to Canada for years to get access to low-cost drugs or traveled to the Caribbean for cheap surgeries, the high price of Sovaldi combined with the demand from patients is creating an extreme form of medical tourism. There are 3.2 million people in the U.S. with chronic hepatitis C. Sovaldi, which has been on the market in the U.S. for less than two years, has shown to cure at least 90 percent of people of the liver-destroying virus. \u201cI know people who have hepatitis C and the only thing they can think about is getting this drug,\u201d said Jonathan Edelheidt, chief executive officer of the Palm Beach Gardens, Florida-based Medical Tourism Association, who said his group\u2019s members are gearing up to help patients start traveling to lower-cost countries to buy the drug. \u201cThere is definitely a high interest in going abroad.\u201d Leena Menghaney, a lawyer working with patients to gain affordable access to hepatitis drugs, said the current situation reminds her of the early days of the AIDS epidemic when patients from South Africa were traveling to Thailand or India for antiviral drugs. The demand is \u201ccoming from countries where treatment is being rationed and patients are waiting in line for treatment in the public health-care system, or their insurance doesn\u2019t cover it, and they are desperate to get on to treatment,\u201d Menghaney said. Health Flight Solutions, an Orlando, Florida, company that provides technology services to medical tourism agencies, is putting together a network of foreign doctors and hospitals willing to prescribe the drug to U.S. patients, said CEO Anuja Agrawal. She said her company is working with the generic manufacturers to verify that the hospitals in her network aren\u2019t getting counterfeit drugs. \u201cWe have already seen some movement, but I think we are going to see an explosion over the next several months,\u201d Agrawal said. Greg Jefferys, a 61-year-old historian from Australia, is one of those who has already made the trip. Jefferys\u2019 doctor told him the government wouldn\u2019t subsidize the cost of Sovaldi for him because his disease wasn\u2019t advanced enough. He\u2019d have to wait until the virus further scarred his liver or pay the retail price of nearly $90,000. It was money he didn\u2019t have and he didn\u2019t want to get any sicker so when a friend mentioned to him that the drug was being sold for much less in India, he immediately booked a trip there. When he landed earlier this month, a mutual acquaintance in India referred him to a doctor at Apollo Hospital in Chennai, a gleaming, modern facility that specialized in treating patients from overseas, he said. The doctor he saw was trained in the U.K. and had practiced for years in London. He charged $20 for the appointment. To buy the drugs, his doctor referred him to a drug distributor who works for Mylan NV, one of the licensed generic manufacturers. The distributor, located on the top floor of a house with boxes scattered about, sold him the full course of treatment for $1,000 -- the price of one pill in Australia and the U.S. The flight, hotel and transportation were an additional $2,000. Jefferys said he has no doubt he got the actual drug, not a counterfeit, and will find out for sure when he gets his viral load checked in a few days. Since writing about his experience on his blog, he said he has been getting inundated with e-mails from patients around the world asking how they can do the same after being denied the drug in their home country. \u201cWhat are your choices? One is to wait for the liver to get cirrhosis and get real sick or go to India and get the medication,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole thing for me was $3,000. You\u2019d spend that on an old car -- that isn\u2019t a lot of money to pay to get your health back.\u201d Until recently, traveling abroad for the drugs through a medical tourism agency cost patients around $40,000 for the drug in countries were it was already being sold for less than in the U.S. though not nearly as low as the prices now available. Those costs included the flight, accommodations, doctor bills and testing, and travel agent fees, said Agrawal. She expects that to drop significantly to about \u201cseveral thousand dollars\u201d now that the cheap generics have come on the market. Gilead has put some measures in place to try to prevent the drug from being sold outside the low-income countries, like requiring the products have a unique trade name and asking the generic companies to try to ensure patients have a valid prescription. But Gilead doesn\u2019t require patients show proof of citizenship, which could make it more difficult for patients in the poorer countries to get access, and there is little it can do to stop patients from buying medicine online or traveling overseas, said Gregg Alton, Gilead\u2019s executive vice president of corporate and medical affairs. \u201cWe aren\u2019t surprised; we knew this was going to happen. This is a reality of having these types of programs,\u201d said Alton. \u201cAs soon as a gray market develops, there isn\u2019t much we can do to control it at a pharmacy level.\u201d Instead, Gilead is trying to improve access in the U.S. and other countries by negotiating with insurers and governments and setting up a patient assistance program for those without insurance or high co-pays. Ikris Pharma Network, a consultancy that helps patients source drugs that are hard to find, has been getting 50 to 60 inquiries a day about the drug since the first generics were introduced in India in March, said Praveen Sikri, general manager at the Delhi-based firm. He has helped patients travel to India to purchase generic versions of Sovaldi or buy it through friends and relatives, he said. So far, most of the patients buying India-made generics of the drug are from Asian countries including China and Singapore, and Dubai, with a small number coming from Europe and the U.S., he said. There are also companies online who say they are selling the drug. A search by Bloomberg News found more than a dozen Indian drug distributors who say they are selling generic versions of Sovaldi made by Mylan, Cipla Ltd. and Natco Pharma Ltd. for about $1,000 for the 12-week course of therapy. The companies say they will ship the drug worldwide or sell directly to patients who come to India to buy it. That is concerning to U.S. regulators who fear the quality of the medicines being sold online outside the traditional supply chain can\u2019t be verified. The Food and Drug Administration has warned in the past that many drugs sold by Internet pharmacies are counterfeit and don\u2019t contain the appropriate amount of the active ingredient or, at worst, are tainted with harmful chemicals. It has not issued any specific warnings on Sovaldi. In the past several years, the FDA has found cases of fake cancer drugs that don\u2019t contain any of the active ingredients, the antiviral Tamiflu tainted with an antibiotic that can cause severe allergic reactions, and the erectile dysfunction drug Cialis containing pain killers. Arvind Jain, manager at Deep Lifecare, a pharmaceutical exporter in New Delhi, said the firm is selling Mylan or Natco generics of Sovaldi for about $850 for the full 12-week course. He said most of the business is coming from word-of-mouth and he\u2019s willing to ship the drug. \u201cLots of people from around the world are making inquiries about this medicine,\u201d Jain said. Varun Medicals, a pharmaceutical wholesaler in Maharashtra, India, says it\u2019s selling a generic version of Sovaldi made by Natco for about $960 for the full course of therapy. He said he has received requests from the U.S. for more information, but no one has placed an order. Both companies were found doing a search for \u201cSovaldi\u201d on the online marketplace India Mart and advertise dozens of other generic drugs for sale on their websites. Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in a statement that the company doesn\u2019t sell to any \u201ce-commerce entities\u201d when asked about companies claiming to sell the drug online. Anant Atal, a spokesman for Cipla, didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail and a call seeking comment. M. Adinarayana, a spokesman for Natco, didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. The drug is also showing up for sale alongside illegal goods and narcotics on the dark Web, which can only be accessed through identity-hiding software. Cyber security analysts at data security firm Dell Secure Works found drugs that the seller claimed were Cipla generics of Sovaldi for sale for $1,031. The seller says it ships worldwide, including to the U.S. and Europe, and takes payment in Bitcoins. There are no details on who the seller is other than a username, which is a region outside of Moscow, and a 100 percent positive rating from 22 users. Other sellers weren\u2019t always what they appeared to be. DropShipMD, a \u201cdistribution, trading and drop shipping\u201d company, says on its website it will ship generic Sovaldi made by Mylan for $1,300 and other generic versions for $1,500 to customers in the U.S. and Europe with a prescription via express mail. It also offers patients the option to pick the drug up in Mumbai with cash. Located at the address listed for DropShipMD, a basement unit in a rundown Mumbai apartment complex with tinted windows and a vinyl door, is another pharmaceutical exporter, Vivin International. Ramesh Akkela, CEO of Vivin International, said his firm has no affiliation with DropShipMD, which he said was using his address without his permission. Akkela said his company does sell Natco\u2019s generic Sovaldi to Singapore and Africa, though he insisted it doesn\u2019t ship to the U.S. All the more reason, companies like Agrawal\u2019s say, patients need them to help ensure they are getting the real drug. \u201cWhen the margin is that high, there are going to be a lot of people who will try to make a quick buck on it,\u201d said Agrawal.

Prosecutors claim Ulbricht, 30, who they say ran the site under the name \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d tried in March and April 2013 to arrange the murder of \u201cFriendlyChemist,\u201d a Silk Road vendor who threatened to disclose the identities of customers and vendors on the site. \u201cIn my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn\u2019t mind if he was executed,\u201d Dread Pirate Roberts wrote to a Silk Road user called \u201credandwhite\u201d in a March 25, 2013, message that was read aloud by a prosecutor in Manhattan federal court Thursday. \u201cRedandwhite\u201d claimed he was a drug supplier who was owed money by FriendlyChemist, according to the government. The trial day ended on Thursday before jurors could hear the rest of the exchange. The government is set to finish reading the messages and rest its case on Monday. Ulbricht must then tell prosecutors whether he plans to testify in his own defense. Prosecutors claimed Ulbricht tried to arrange as many as six killings, including the murder of a former Silk Road employee. No murders were actually carried out, and he isn\u2019t charged in the plots in the New York case. He\u2019s charged with one of the alleged murder-for-hire plots in Baltimore. Earlier in the day, a U.S. agent testified that he traced bitcoins worth more than $13 million on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop to Silk Road, as the government sought to undercut his defense that the money came from trading the digital currency. Ilhwan Yum, a former special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told jurors he was able to trace the bitcoins from Silk Road\u2019s computer servers to the Samsung 700Z laptop that agents grabbed when Ulbricht was arrested in a San Francisco public library in October 2013. Yum, who is now a senior director with FTI Consulting Inc., testified that he used Blockchain, a website where bitcoin transactions are recorded. More than 700,000 bitcoins on Ulbricht\u2019s computer were traced to Silk Road, where customers used the currency to buy heroin, LSD, Ecstasy, computer hacking tools and phony identification, Yum said. About 90,000 bitcoins weren\u2019t matched to Silk Road transactions, Yum told jurors. Ulbricht faces as long as life in prison if convicted. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, who\u2019s overseeing the trial, denied a request from Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Dratel, for a delay until Monday to prepare to question Yum. Forrest ruled that Dratel was responsible for raising the issue in his opening statement Jan. 13 and should be prepared to counter the government\u2019s evidence. \u201cBitcoin was worth almost nothing in 2010 when an investor in bitcoin could buy them for pennies,\u201d Dratel told jurors in his opening statement. By the end of 2013, \u201cit\u2019s worth hundreds and hundreds dollars. Think about what kind of profit you can make just trading bitcoin.\u201d Dratel said in his opening statement that his client had conceived the idea for Silk Road as an \u201ceconomic experiment.\u201d Ulbricht passed the site to others within a few months of starting it in 2011, Dratel said. Later in the trial, Dratel claimed Ulbricht was set up as a \u201cfall guy\u201d by Mark Karpeles, the former head of the bankrupt Mt. Gox Co. bitcoin exchange. Dratel claimed Karpeles was the true mastermind behind Silk Road. Karpeles, who lives in Japan, has denied involvement with Silk Road. He hasn\u2019t been charged. After the opening statement, Yum and a colleague prepared the analysis in less than two weeks, at a cost of $468 per hour to the government, Dratel said. The case is U.S. v.

Draper didn\u2019t disclose how much he paid for either winning bid. After yesterday\u2019s auction, the agency will still have more than 94,000 bitcoins, worth about $35 million at current prices, to sell. The price of bitcoin has declined about 42 percent since the June auction, according to CoinDesk\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index, an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. Yesterday\u2019s auction attracted 11 bidders, the agency said, compared with 45 bidders the last time. Pantera Capital and a syndicate created by the trading division of SecondMarket Inc. also said they planned to participate in the auction. Draper Associates will invest 300 bitcoins into every company that works with Boost, a bitcoin startup accelerator founded by Draper\u2019s son, Adam Draper. \u201cThe interesting part is that we are fixing the valuation, and the 300 bitcoins are worth about $120,000 today, but may be worth quite a bit more (or less) when the entrepreneurs receive them,\u201d Draper said in the e-mail. The auction is part of a cache of bitcoins the FBI transferred to U.S. Marshals after shutting down Silk Road, which the U.S. said was run by Ross William Ulbricht. The marketplace was an online bazaar where anonymous users allegedly bought and sold heroin, LSD, phony passports and computer hacking services.

Two indictments, unsealed Tuesday, tied three of four suspects to previously reported hacks of\xa0JPMorgan Chase & Co., E*Trade Financial Corp., Scottrade Financial Services Inc. and Dow Jones & Co., a unit of News Corp. QuickTake Cybersecurity Hackers and conspirators in more than a dozen countries generated hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds on pump-and-dump stock schemes and particularly lucrative online gambling, prosecutors said.\xa0 From 2012 to mid-2015, the suspects and their co-conspirators successfully manipulated dozens of publicly traded stocks, sent misleading pitches to clients of banks and brokerages whose e-mail addresses they\u2019d stolen,\xa0and profited by using trading accounts set up under fake names, prosecutors said. Along the way, members of the ring\xa0tried to extract nonpublic information from financial corporations, processed payment information for fake pharmaceuticals and fake anti-virus software, falsified passports and took control of a New Jersey credit union, said prosecutors.\xa0They used 75 companies and bank and brokerage accounts around the world to launder money, prosecutors wrote. Other alleged offenses include hacking, securities fraud, wire fraud and identity theft. The global network stretched from Israel to the U.S., with a dozen online casinos and payments that ran through Cyprus, Azerbaijan and Switzerland.\xa0 The co-conspirators deceived financial institutions into processing and authorizing payments to and from the casino companies and others, prosecutors wrote in their latest indictment of Gery Shalon, Joshua Aaron and Ziv Orenstein, who they say are at the center of the scheme. Shalon and Orenstein were arrested in Israel in July. Aaron remains at large. \u201cThey colluded with corrupt international bank officials who willfully ignored its criminal nature in order to profit from, as a co-conspirator described it to Shalon, their payment processing \u2018casino/software/pharmaceutical cocktail\u2019,\u201d according to the indictment of the three.\xa0 Anthony Murgio, who was arrested in Florida in July, was indicted separately for crimes related to a Bitcoin-exchange service and the takeover of a New Jersey credit union to further the business. Shalon was the leader and self-described \u201cfounder\u201d of the sprawling cybercriminal enterprise, which the indictment describes as having hundreds of employees and co-conspirators.\xa0In one case, according to the indictment, he boasted that a profitable stock sale was a \u201csmall step towards a large empire.\u201d \u201cWe buy them [i.e., stocks] very cheap, perform machinations, then play with them,\u201d Shalon is cited as explaining to a co-conspirator. Responding to the co-conspirator\u2019s rhetorical question about whether buying stocks was popular among Americans, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s like drinking freaking vodka in Russia.\u201d Shalon -- an Israeli citizen who also went by the names Garri Shalelashvili, Phillipe Mousset and Christopher Engeham -- directed hacks to further his market-manipulation and Internet gambling schemes, the indictment said. Shalon concealed at least $100 million in Swiss and other bank accounts, it said. The new allegations against the four broaden dramatically the scope of a wide-ranging criminal enterprise with hacking at its core.\xa0Outlines of the government\u2019s case against the men emerged with their arrest in July, when Shalon, Orenstein and Aaron were implicated in a pump-and-dump scheme. The three men were linked to hacks of JPMorgan, Fidelity Investments Ltd. and E*Trade, Bloomberg News reported at the time. The hackers located some 10 million e-mail addresses of customers and stole millions of those from Dow Jones, identified as Victim 8 in the indictment. In October, the company disclosed that its computer systems had been hacked. As part of that disclosure, Dow Jones Chief Executive Officer William Lewis said that some customer payment information may have been compromised -- on no more than 3,500 accounts -- and that it was unknown whether other information had been taken. A week earlier, Scottrade disclosed that it had been hacked and that information on 4.6 million customers had been taken. According to the indictment, Shalom and a co-conspirator expanded their efforts to seek material non-public information from firms they were hacking. In one e-mail, they referred to seeking "interesting info" from top managers at Victim 5, a St. Louis brokerage firm now confirmed as Scottrade. A spokeswoman for Dow Jones said in a statement: "The indictment unsealed today refers to the public disclosure we made on October 9. The government\u2019s investigation is ongoing, and we continue to cooperate with law enforcement." The hack of Fidelity has been previously reported. The company said it has no indication that any customer accounts, customer information or related systems were affected.

A total of about 144,341 bitcoins, worth about $86 million at current prices, was transferred to the agency from the FBI, the authorities said. The hoard for sale represents part of the bitcoins seized in October when Silk Road\u2019s operator, Ross William Ulbricht, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit computer hacking and conspiracy to launder money. The website was a \u201csprawling black-market bazaar\u201d used by drug dealers and other vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and launder hundreds of millions of dollars derived from the illicit transactions, the U.S. said.

The winner or winners will be announced on June 30. Linzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals, said the rest of the bitcoins may be sold at a later date. \u201cThose other bitcoins are in a wallet controlled by the Marshals,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cThey are subject to an interlocutory sale order and may be sold pursuant to a court order at a later date.\u201d The U.S. seized about 173,991 bitcoins during the investigation, according to Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The amount being prepared for auction corresponds to the number that was recovered from servers used to run the Silk Road site. The rest of the total involved bitcoins stored on computer hardware belonging to Ulbrich. On Jan. 15, the bitcoins recovered from Silk Road servers were ordered forfeited in a civil action filed by the U.S. which seeks all of Silk Road\u2019s assets.

The banks have successfully tested the technology with each other, and will invite other companies into the system next year, Shirish Wadivkar, head of payables, receivables & flow FX at Standard Chartered and Lum Yin Fong, DBS\u2019s global head of client management and implementation, said on a call with Bloomberg on Thursday. Estimates on development costs aren\u2019t available yet, they said. In pursuing the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, Standard Chartered and DBS are developing a new approach that could improve the trade finance business by speeding up banking transactions, while cutting costs and boosting transparency. This is the world\u2019s first application of distributed ledgers in trade finance, the banks said in an e-mailed statement also released Thursday. \u201cThis could revolutionize and transform trade operations, enhancing risk mitigation and creating more efficient processes for both corporates and banks,\u201d Lum said in the press release. Banks are seeking ways to bolster trade-finance operations in Asia that have been hobbled by slowing economic growth in the region and slumping commodity prices. Since reaching a peak of about $145 billion in June last year, the value of trade loans provided by banks in Singapore and Hong Kong has tumbled 38 percent due to the slowing Chinese economy and a slump in commodity prices, central bank data show. Standard Chartered ranked second after HSBC Holdings Plc in terms of its market share in arranging trade finance for large Asian companies, according to a survey by the Stamford, Connecticut-based research firm Greenwich Associates published on Sept. 16. DBS ranked fifth, the survey said. Risks in the Asian trade-finance business were evident last year when London-based Standard Chartered took a $193 million write-off against its exposure to a metals warehouse fraud in China, which also hit Citigroup Inc. and Standard Bank Group Ltd. The incident involved a Chinese company pledging the same metals stockpiles to banks several times for loans. At the moment, trade-finance transactions take place bilaterally between a borrower and a bank. With distributed ledger technology, each transaction is recorded and shared among participants of the system, said Wadivkar. Once recorded, the transaction cannot be erased from the system, he said. The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, which oversees the nation\u2019s information technology and telecommunications, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the central bank, were involved in the project, which may be extended to the rest of Asia. \u201cWe\u2019d also like it to be used across the region as well, because it\u2019s only then that you are able to mitigate the risk in duplicate transactions," said Lum.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': u'Chanyaporn Chanjaroen', 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-17/stanchart-dbs-partner-on-distributed-ledger-for-trade-finance', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 17, 2, 53, 7, 147000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'StanChart, DBS Work on Distributed Ledger for Trade Finance'}, {'articleText': u' A handcuffed Evan Greebel walked out of the FBI\u2019s New York headquarters a few steps ahead of ex-Retrophin Inc. CEO Martin Shkreli, but prosecutors say the men were side-by-side when it came to a multimillion-dollar fraud at the company\u2019s expense. A New York mergers and acquisitions lawyer with the law firm Kaye Scholer LLP, Greebel was indicted for actions while representing Shkreli and his biopharmaceutical firm from 2012 to 2014. Greebel, then with Katten Muchin & Rosenman LLP, allegedly helped the young CEO misappropriate assets to pay off his personal debts, according to the indictment unsealed Thursday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. Greebel, 42, was present with Shkreli, 32, at all \u201crelevant\u201d Retrophin board meetings and helped conceal sham agreements from the board and investors, prosecutors contend. Greebel made sure Retrophin\u2019s outside accountants were unaware of Shkreli\u2019s financial maneuvers, and helped him concoct consulting deals used to repay investors at a hedge fund run by Shkreli, according to the government. Shkreli,\xa0who spurred an outcry in September by sharply raising costs for drugs owned by his current firm, Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC, has said all of his transactions at Retrophin were done with board and attorney approval. He was later ousted from the company, which isn\u2019t charged with any wrongdoing. Both men pleaded not guilty in an initial court appearance Thursday and were released on bail. They face decades in prison if convicted on fraud and conspiracy charges. Kaye Scholer said in a statement that Greebel, of Scarsdale, New York, joined the law firm this summer and that \u201cthe transactions in question predate his arrival.\u201d The law firm said later in a statement that it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the charges and is conducting its own internal investigation. \u201cBased on our findings we will take appropriate action,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we cannot comment on an active federal investigation or on our internal investigation.\u201d In 2011, Shkreli founded Retrophin, focusing on drugs for \u201cdebilitating and life-threatening diseases.\u201d He took it public in December 2012. Shkreli, Greebel and others were accused of orchestrating three interrelated schemes, including one where Greebel figured prominently, according to prosecutors. Shkreli, assisted by Greebel, defrauded Retrophin by transferring some of its shares to a separate partnership entity, MSMB Capital, founded by Shkreli, according to the indictment. The men caused Retrophin to enter into settlements and \u201csham consulting agreements\u201d with MSMB and another Shkreli entity, MSMB Healthcare Funds, to settle debts and liabilities Shkreli owed. They \u201cengineered a series of fraudulent transactions that were backdated to the summer of 2012 to create the appearance\u201d that MSMB Capital had invested in Retrophin, according to the indictment. Greebel is accused of providing a \u201ctemplate share transfer agreement\u201d of Retrophin shares to MSMB Capital. He is also charged with removing company accountants from an e-mail chain on which Shkreli backdated an agreement to transfer the shares. In total, Shkreli, Greebel and others are accused of causing Retrophin to pay $3.4 million in cash and stock to settle debt claims it wasn\u2019t responsible for, and to pay $7.6 million in cash and stock as a result of the fake deals. According to Greebel\u2019s Kaye Scholer bio page, he was an expert in virtual currency, \u201cspecifically advising on the creation of the first bitcoin ETF and one of the first U.S. regulated bitcoin exchanges.\u201d He was involved in a long list of high-profile transactions, including representing ImClone Systems Inc. in its $6.5 billion sale to Eli Lilly and Co., the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization in its sale to Imagem Music Group, and Atlantic Coast Entertainment in its sale of the The Sands Hotel Casino in Atlantic City to Pinnacle Entertainment Inc.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': u'Gabe Friedman', 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-17/shkreli-s-lawyer-accused-of-templating-sham-retrophin-share-deal', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 17, 22, 29, 25, 899000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Shkreli's Lawyer Accused of Templating Sham Retrophin Share Deal"}, {'articleText': u'  A U.S. judge who froze assets belonging to the American affiliate of bankrupt Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox Co. loosened that restraint to see where some of the digital currency flows. U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman in Chicago today revised his temporary order issued March 11 to allow movement -- and possibly tracking -- of small amounts of Bitcoin. Jay Edelson, a lawyer for Mt. Gox depositor Gregory Greene, told the judge today that he was \u201ctrying to find a pot of crypto-gold.\u201d Greene sued the exchange and and its principal, Mark Karpeles, for fraud last month. His lawyers asked for the revised order to look for assets belonging to the U.S. affiliate, Karpeles and a related company, Tibanne KK. Mt. Gox Co. filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo on Feb. 28 after announcing earlier last month that that it couldn\u2019t account for 750,000 customer Bitcoins and about 100,000 of its own, about 7 percent of Bitcoins worldwide. Mt. Gox said in a statement today that it had located about 200,000 Bitcoins stored in an old-format \u201cwallet\u201d that it had previously counted as missing. The company said its revised count of missing Bitcoins, 650,000, may change depending on the results of an investigation. Greene, who said he lost access to about $25,000 in Bitcoins, has accused the companies and Karpeles of misappropriation. Mt. Gox, which started as a marketplace for illustrated trading cards used to play the game \u201cMagic: The Gathering,\u201d is under investigation by prosecutors and regulators examining the use of the digital currency. The Tokyo-based exchange sought protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas and a day later obtained an order shielding it from litigation. Bitcoin last traded at $582.46, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Feinerman has said while the bankruptcy court order protects Mt. Gox from the case before him, it doesn\u2019t apply to Karpeles, his Japanese company Tibanne KK or a related company incorporated in Delaware, Mt. Gox Inc. While lawyers for Mt. Gox Co. asked Feinerman to recognize the Dallas court order on March 11, no attorneys have appeared in the Chicago case for Karpeles, Tibanne or the U.S. affiliate. In a revised complaint on March 14, Greene added as a defendant Mizuho bank, a Japanese lender that held Mt. Gox accounts and processed wire money transfers between the Bitcoin exchange and users in the U.S. and elsewhere. The judge, who likened the effort to follow the Bitcoin transactions to a sting operation, today extended his temporary restraining order, which was set to expire March 25. The asset freeze remains in place until April 8, with the exception of Bitcoin transactions worth less than $1,000. Edelson didn\u2019t disclose details of how the allowed transactions would be tracked. The case is Greene v. Mt. Gox Inc., 14-cv-01437, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).

Even though Life360\u2019s family-focused location app was designed for use in the U.S., it was suddenly being downloaded in huge volumes in Asia. The trend quickly spread to several countries in Europe, even South America. Six months later, more than half of Life360\u2019s user base is now overseas. Life360 didn\u2019t spend a dime on marketing overseas, and many of its app\u2019s core features don\u2019t even work outside U.S. borders. Life360 offers a location service, which allows families to keep tabs on their members\u2019 locations through geofencing technology. For instance, when junior arrives home from school, mom and dad get a text message notification that he has arrived. Life 360 supports international maps, and the app is available for download in the Google Play\xa0store, iTunes\xa0App Store, and further app markets internationally. But it doesn\u2019t register phone numbers outside the U.S., and everything in the app is written in English. That means some 15 million customers are using only a bare-bones version of its service, getting location alerts through e-mail instead of SMS, amd many are deciphering a foreign language to use its core functions. Why? Hulls says he has noticed that carriers all over the world have started launching and marketing their own family locator apps. As with many carrier services, those apps come with hefty monthly subscription fees and lack the features of independently developed equivalents. Hulls thinks Life360 basically rode the operators\u2019 marketing wave. Consumers were disappointed in what their carriers offered, so they searched app stores and came across Life360, Hulls says. \u201cA good example is the carrier\u2019s navigation apps,\u201d Hulls says. \u201cThey were cash cows for a while, but consumers turned to free apps like Waze, not only because they were free, but because they were so much better at what they were intended to do than what the carriers were offering.\u201d You can imagine what\u2019s happening now. Life360 is adding global support for its app. It will start with international SMS and foreign-language support in several Asian countries this fall, and then move to Europe and other regions of the world later this year and in 2014. One of the main reasons Life360 needs to get fully localized in other countries is because it wants to get paid. Those millions of families are using its free service, which lets them track their members\u2019 locations gratis but allows them to set only two geofences (usually home and work). Life360\u2019s business model is built on converting those free users into subscribers paying $5 per month per family. That premium service allows users to set up geofences around 25 locations and get access to a live adviser to help with minor emergencies, such as arranging a tow truck or contacting a locksmith. Although only a small portion of its customers have signed up for the premium plan so far\u2014Hulls won\u2019t reveal how many\u2014Life360 has a big base to work from. The Fontinalis-and Bessemer-backed startup has already signed up 30 million free users, each forming part of one of its 17 million individual family networks. I say networks because Hulls doesn\u2019t view Life360 as merely a tracking app. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to shake this notion that we\u2019re only a tool for over-protective parents or suspicious spouses,\u201d Hulls says. Instead, Life360 wants to use location as the foundation for a family-oriented private social network. (Think an even more restrictive Path built around GPS.) The idea is to create a social nucleus in which members can communicate, using location as the primary reference. If dad is halfway home, mom can ping him in-app to remind him to stop by the grocery store. When your daughter\u2019s flight gets in early, the entire family is notified simultaneously, allowing them to coordinate who will pick her up. You can actually think of Life360 as one of the new breed of anti-social networks that take advantage of social media\u2019s new tools, while actually limiting their social scope. Hulls says that when you\u2019re dealing in real-time location, privacy becomes of utmost importance. By limiting the social network to a family, Life360 can take full advantage of location services without imposing complicated in-network safeguards to protect privacy. Ultimately Hulls believes this kind of nuclear network will set it apart from successful geosocial networks such as Foursquare and the not-so-successful networks like Loopt. That might also explain why Life360 is taking off overseas, particularly in Europe, where privacy on social networks has traditionally been a much bigger concern than in the U.S. \nAlso from GigaOM:\n Delivering Positive ROI from Mobile Enabled Projects (subscription required) \n3 Reasons Why Bitcoin Is Getting Its Groove Back\n \nThe Meta-Quantified Self: Argus App for iOS Tracks All Your Health-Tracking Apps\n \nThe Weird iPad-Only School in the Netherlands that May Be the Future of Education\n \nUpgrading to iOS 7 Means Learning a New Language\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-03/life360-s-app-knows-where-your-children-are', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 3, 16, 58, 6, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Life360\u2019s App Knows Where Your Children Are'}, {'articleText': u'  Christian Martin and Leonard Nuara go to a lot of bitcoin conferences, and, at 49 and 55, respectively, they invariably feel old. \u201cEveryone else is 25 and good-looking,\u201d Nuara says.

Prosecutors claim Ulbricht, 30, started the site and ran it until his arrest in October 2013. Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a Department of Homeland Security special agent, testified today in Ulbricht\u2019s criminal trial that in August 2013 he wondered whether the real person behind the screen name had changed 16 months earlier. \u201cThere was always a level of distrust about who you were talking to,\u201d Der-Yeghiayan said under questioning by Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Dratel. Dratel was seeking to show that his client gave up control of the site within months of starting it and was then set up as a \u201cfall guy\u201d by the new operators. Ulbricht faces as much as life in prison if convicted of conspiracy and Internet drug trafficking in the trial in Manhattan federal court, which started Tuesday and may last as long as six weeks. Der-Yeghiayan testified that agents maintained at least a dozen accounts on the illicit website, taking over the online identities of cooperating witnesses including a woman who went by the name \u201cScout.\u201d The agent said investigators often didn\u2019t know who they were dealing with. In a June 2013 message, Der-Yeghiayan expressed frustration over the uncertain identities on Silk Road. \u201cSheesh, who\u2019s on first?\u201d he asked. The government claims more than 1 million drug sales were done through Silk Road, with customers using bitcoins to buy drugs and other illegal goods. The site barred ads for child pornography, weapons of mass destruction, counterfeit currency, murder-for-hire and stolen credit cards, Der-Yeghiayan said. In testimony today and yesterday, Der-Yeghiayan told jurors he worked as a Silk Road site administrator for several months as part of the government\u2019s investigation, communicating online with Dread Pirate Roberts and coworkers known as Libertas, Samesamebutdifferent and Inigo, without knowing their real identities. Der-Yeghiayan said he used the name Cirrus, concealing the fact that he was a law-enforcement agent. Ulbricht took his online identity from a character in the 1987 film \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d according to prosecutors. In the film, \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d is a name taken by a series of men who pass the identity to chosen successors and retire. Der-Yeghiayan testified that Silk Road\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts used a unique cryptographic key consisting of a long string of characters, to identify himself to users of the site. In his questioning, Dratel suggested the key could be passed from one person to another, like a car key or file key. Silk Road was operated on the Tor network, which routes communications through a series of computers to allow users to be anonymous. Prosecutors claim Ulbricht tried to arrange the murders of at least six people who threatened his multimillion-dollar business. No murders were actually carried out. Ulbricht is charged separately in federal court in Baltimore for one of the alleged plots. The case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 14-cr-00068, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

The CCEDK Crypto Coins Exchange Denmark ApS, which opened in May, will start offering the service today, Chief Executive Officer Ronny Boesing said in an interview. Clients can also exchange NXT, which was created in November, into Nordic currencies, he said. \u201cNXT is a strong currency and a potential challenger to Bitcoin as a leading virtual currency,\u201d Boesing said. \u201cIn terms of safety, it\u2019s perceived as being as safe as bitcoin, if not safer.\u201d Bitcoin, in which CCEDK also offers trading, has lost 45 percent of its value after surging to more than $1,100 last year. The software is now poised to decline further, according to a Bloomberg Global Poll of financial professionals. Bitcoins, which could be purchased for about $13 each at the beginning of last year, were valued at about $625 this week. Since being introduced eight months ago, NXT has grown to a market capitalization of about $44 million compared with ripple\u2019s $50 million, litecoin\u2019s $265 million and bitcoin\u2019s $8.11 billion, according to website coinmarketcap.com. There are 1 billion NXT in existence and, unlike bitcoin, no new ones can be created via mining. \u201cAt the moment, people use bitcoin to buy NXT on other exchanges and we will make it easier to invest directly in this second-generation virtual currency,\u201d Boesing said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to add NXT to our platform because it\u2019s a currency that\u2019s growing very fast, backed by a very strong community.\u201d Investors are buying the currency to store it as an investment or to use it for online purchases, he said. It also has so-called second-generation crypto currency features that bitcoin lacks. These include the NXT asset exchange, a platform where the currency can be used for crowd-funding and commodity investments. Virtual currencies have come under increased scrutiny from regulators and prosecutors around the globe. Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in Japan earlier this year amid claims it lost 850,000 bitcoins. China\u2019s central bank barred financial firms from handling virtual currency transactions last year. The European Commission this month signaled it will try to impose rules on virtual currencies after the European Banking Authority said banks shouldn\u2019t buy, hold or sell such products until regulators develop safeguards to protect their integrity. The CCEDK exchange also offers trading in litecoin and peercoin and supports trading from seven physical currencies: dollars, euros, pounds, Swiss francs, Danish kroner, Swedish kronor and Norwegian kroner. \u201cIn time, we hope to be able to offer trading in all the top 10 virtual currencies,\u201d Boesing said. There are more than 200 crypto currencies being traded, according to coinmarketcap.com. The number of currencies and their joint market capitalization is bound to decline \u201cto a level that is consistent with their value as a transfer mechanism, and not reflecting their value as a medium of exchange,\u201d said Paul Donovan, global economist at UBS AG in London. \u201cSociety has always had local currencies, barter systems, and other substitutes for official currency transactions,\u201d Donovan said in an e-mailed reply to questions. \u201cTechnology has allowed these local currencies etc. to assume a larger scale in terms of both transactions and geographic scope, and the distinction between virtual and real world economy has blurred.

Some of his members want him to focus on a less lofty goal: helping them make lots of old-fashioned cash. Matonis, a longtime advocate of what he calls \u201cnon-political money,\u201d has built the group into a kind of a bitcoin governing body. Early this month he hired a Washington lobby firm, and yesterday he unveiled a website aimed at raising the virtual currency\u2019s public profile. Some foundation members are dismayed by Matonis\u2019 leadership and grander plans. Investors from Silicon Valley in particular would like the group to focus on more technical matters, particularly fortifying the underlying bitcoin software so it can grow into a viable, large-scale payment network. Running the foundation is like \u201cgoing downhill in a go-cart trying to keep the wheels on,\u201d Matonis said in an interview yesterday. \u201cThere are different constituencies going in different directions.\u201d Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, lured by the technology\u2019s promise, have plowed time and money into bitcoin businesses -- and they\u2019re demanding software upgrades to develop the digital currency\u2019s commercial potential. \u201cThe impact of the bitcoin protocol is economic,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, chief executive of Circle Internet Financial, a Boston-based bitcoin startup, said in an interview. \u201cThese are higher stakes than with other open-source software.\u201d The organization, established in 2012 and modeled on the Linux Foundation, the open-source operating system created in the early 1990s, has tried to mix stewardship of the code with political advocacy. Unlike Linux, bitcoin rapidly became a channel for billions of dollars in transactions, making security and capacity bottom-line issues for entrepreneurs. Matonis said that pressure to invest more in bitcoin\u2019s computer code reflects a \u201cfight over who controls the policy dialogue,\u201d and whether the group will continue to fund lobbying. \u201cTech investors want to make sure that all the resources in the world are there on the tech side,\u201d he said. Bitcoins are part of a software system that transfers digital assets from owner to owner without using a third party. Startups are seeking to use the innovation to disrupt the existing payment system dominated by firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., Visa Inc. and Western Union Co. The core software managed by the foundation contains instructions that let computers communicate with one another to verify transactions on bitcoin\u2019s public ledger, called the blockchain. Another program enables users to conduct those transactions. Software upgrades are made through an informal system of mostly part-time developers who communicate in Internet chat rooms. Gavin Andresen, the foundation\u2019s chief scientist, was until May the only paid coder working on bitcoin. Online discussions sometimes devolve into virtual shouting matches, according to Andresen. This year, the bitcoin network processed between $20 million and $580 million per day in transactions, according to the data aggregated on blockchain.info. \u201cThis is not sustainable,\u201d said Mike Hearn, one of bitcoin\u2019s core developers. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an infrastructure held together by chewing gum and sticky tape and people who work evenings and weekends.\u201d Software upgrades have helped ward off hacking and increased commercial utility. A change in March, for example, improved the security of transactions conducted through online merchants by adapting bitcoin software to the Internet\u2019s existing system for authenticating websites. That tweak pales in comparison to the \u201cnon-trivial problem\u201d of raising the number of transactions the bitcoin network can process, Allaire said. The system can handle about nine transactions per second, far off the roughly 2,400 on Visa\u2019s network. Investors have raised the idea of earmarking donations to the foundation for work on the software. \u201cA lot of people would give a million dollars if it would go solely to development,\u201d said Brock Pierce, a venture capitalist who was recently elected to the foundation\u2019s board. Another board member, Micky Malka, the managing partner at Ribbit Capital, said developers won\u2019t help improve the protocol without good pay, something that\u2019s hard to structure through a foundation. \u201cWe have to find ways that allow more upside for the people who are working on the protocol,\u201d Malka said. Under pressure from the entrepreneur side, the foundation has commissioned a \u201cfeasibility study\u201d to determine whether the software development could happen as part of a partnership with a major university, Matonis said. Or, it could be spun out into a separate body that the foundation organizes. Matonis has frequently argued that bitcoin is a political project that will displace money issued by governments, and has at times disavowed close work with regulators. \u201cThe Foundation is not pro-regulation as some have claimed, but it is pro-education,\u201d he wrote when he became its director in 2012. He has dismissed money laundering as an overly broad category of crime, \u201clike buying a drive-thru donut in a stolen vehicle.\u201d He once wrote that being a customer of bitcoin companies that work with regulators to stop crime \u201cfeels like buying weed from the Drug Enforcement Administration.\u201d Under Matonis, the foundation has hired a new Washington-based global policy counsel, Jim Harper of the libertarian Cato Institution. And this month, it retained Thorsen French Advocacy, a Washington lobbying firm. Many entrepreneurs are keen to dodge the politics that Matonis courts. Nic Cary, the chief executive officer of Blockchain, the largest website for creating digital wallets to hold bitcoins, said the group should improve software and promote consumer adoption of the virtual currency. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a lot of mission creep,\u201d Cary said. \u201cWe need to fund the people who are working on development.\u201d Allaire\u2019s Circle Internet Financial has shareholders including Accel Partners, a venture-capital firm based in Palo Alto, California, and Pantera Capital Management LP, a San Francisco hedge fund backed by Fortress Investment Group. Venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Index Ventures also put money into bitcoin companies. Matonis and the other founders of the group have rules on their side. They set up a system in which individual members elect the same number of board members -- three -- as do all the corporate members. That has raised the possibility, mentioned by Matonis at a meeting in Amsterdam in May, that the foundation could split. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an early Internet advocacy group, spun out the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology in 1994 after similar conflicts. Matonis told his members that he won\u2019t go quietly if the Bitcoin Foundation cracks. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to fracture,\u201d Matonis said in May, \u201cI want to make sure I\u2019m running the one we remember.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-31/bitcoin-up-washington-profile-to-silicon-valley-s-dismay', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 31, 15, 18, 34, 204000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Up Washington Profile to Silicon Valley\u2019s Dismay'}, {'articleText': u' June 8 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg View columnist Justin Fox\npresents a commentary arguing that the defining characteristic\nof the latest generation of bitcoin backers is that they\u2019re\nalready rich and kind of boring.

He agreed to conduct 20 training seminars on bitcoin for law enforcement and financial professionals as a part of his five years of probation. Bitcoins, introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, has no central issuing authority and uses a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions.

He is appealing his conviction and the sentence. In the Miami case, a Miami Beach police officer and a Secret Service agent bought $1,500 of bitcoins from Espinoza and another $1,500 from Reid in separate transactions, according to arrest affidavits filed in the case. The officers found Espinoza and Reid on the bitcoin exchange site LocalBitcoins, where Espinoza went by MichellHack and Reid used the name proy33, according to the filings.

Ross William Ulbricht was convicted of conspiracy and drug trafficking through the cyber-bazaar, where anonymous users used bitcoins to buy drugs, hacking tools and fake identification. The government warned that Silk Road has been used as a blueprint for a new era of online criminal conduct, where corner dealers are replaced by laptops. Ulbricht admitted he founded Silk Road, but said he later turned the site over to others who developed it into the criminal enterprise it became. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan rejected Ulbricht\u2019s claim that he was naive and impulsive when he started Silk Road as an economic experiment. \u201cIt was a carefully planned life\u2019s work,\u201d Forrest said, as Ulbricht, wearing blue prison garb, fidgeted with his hands under the table during the judge\u2019s comments, which lasted almost an hour. \u201cYou wanted it to be your legacy. And it is.\u201d The judge had to choose between two vastly different pictures of Ulbricht in deciding the sentence. \u201cYou\u2019re a complicated person and you don\u2019t fit the typical criminal profile,\u201d she said. Defense lawyers, parents and friends painted him as an idealistic, naive young man who set up the online marketplace and quickly found himself in over his head. Prosecutors said he was more like a drug kingpin, profiting from cyberspace sales of illegal wares, and that he tried to arrange at least five murders to protect his business. The government said it didn\u2019t believe any were carried out. Forrest said there was \u201cample and unambiguous evidence\u201d of the plots. During the sentencing hearing, Forrest heard from the father of a 25-year-old Boston man who died of a heroin overdose and the mother of a 16-year-old Australian who took a drug designed to mimic LSD at a post-prom party and then jumped off a balcony to his death. Prosecutors said the two victims were among at least six who died after taking drugs that were bought through Silk Road. Peter Skinner, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor, said before the sentencing that the government\u2019s decision not to ask for a life sentence reflected a Justice Department decision that some leniency was warranted. Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer, called the sentence \u201cunreasonable, unjust, unfair.\u201d \u201cThis was mainly about appeals to emotion,\u201d Joshua Dratel said. Dratel said Ulbricht will appeal the conviction and sentence, based on rulings Forrest made before and during the trial. Dratel also pointed to charges that two former federal agents involved in the Silk Road investigation stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoins. Lyn Ulbricht, Ross\u2019s mother, said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by the life sentence. She said she fears for her son\u2019s life if he\u2019s assigned to serve his time in a maximum-security prison. Forrest ordered Ulbricht to forfeit $184 million, the total of drug and fake ID sales documented in Silk Road records. Ulbricht claimed Silk Road provided a safer alternative to users who would otherwise buy drugs from street dealers. The ability to rate sellers on the site helped guarantee quality and consistency, reducing the harm to users, he said. It was a claim the judge rejected. Forrest said Silk Road expanded the market for drugs, increasing violence that\u2019s typical in the drug trade in places like Afghanistan and Mexico. She also read excerpts from Ulbricht\u2019s e-mails, citing them as examples of his disregard of the welfare of others. \u201cFirst one\u2019s free, little Johnny,\u201d the judge read from one of the messages. Just weeks after Ulbricht\u2019s arrest, an almost identical online market called \u201cSilk Road 2.0\u201d was launched. Blake Benthall, the alleged operator, was arrested in November and, like Ulbricht, was charged with enabling users to buy and sell drugs and other illegal products. Since then, other dark web marketplaces have popped up, including OpenBazaar, a decentralized market that lets people buy and sell goods directly to each other, without an operator like Ulbricht at the helm. That makes it tougher for law enforcement which has to go after the buyers and sellers instead of an administrator. Ulbricht apologized to the victims\u2019 families and said he wasn\u2019t greedy or vain, and doesn\u2019t care for status symbols or luxury. \u201cI was taught to be humble and live a modest lifestyle,\u201d he told the judge, holding back tears during his statement. Ulbricht\u2019s lack of sophistication helped lead to his downfall, said Austin Berglas, former Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Cyber Branch in New York. He supervised the team that investigated Silk Road. Berglas said Ulbricht had some understanding of running an online marketplace, but needed help. Some of the know-how came from his friend Richard Bates, a computer programmer. Bates, frowning and reluctant, testified against Ulbricht at trial as part of an agreement to avoid prosecution. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running a site for so long, you\u2019re going to leave digital breadcrumbs,\u201d said Berglas, now the head of cyber investigations and incident response for K2 Intelligence. He said he had expected Ulbricht to plead guilty in a bid to win a more lenient sentence. \u201cI think it\u2019s very sad,\u201d Berglas said. \u201cRoss is a young, highly intelligent, motivated individual.\u201d The Ulbricht case is U.S. v.

Under the bail terms set out by U.S Magistrate Judge James Francis in Manhattan Monday, Murgio can travel in parts of Florida and New York to look for a job. Francis ordered him not to communicate with anyone associated with Coin.mx, the bitcoin exchange that he helped run. Murgio was arrested July 21 at his residence in Florida, the same day that a criminal complaint against him was unsealed in New York. He was released more than a week ago. Murgio faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted on the money-laundering charge. Murgio was charged with violating federal anti-money laundering laws by running the cash-for-Bitcoin exchange that allegedly catered to criminals and other customers. According to the allegations, Murgio\u2019s Bitcoin business exchanged at least $1.8 million on behalf of tens of thousands of customers between October 2013 and January 2015.

They are tall and textbook fit, and as poised as Swiss bankers -- Vulcan Swiss bankers. Armstrong, 31 and a former software engineer at Airbnb Inc., shaves his head. Ehrsam, 26 and a former foreign-exchange trader at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., keeps his hair short and very much in place. When they discuss bitcoin, they rarely smile. Do not try to make them laugh. Their seriousness is understandable, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its November 2014 issue. Armstrong and Ehrsam are the founders of a startup called Coinbase Inc., whose mission is to convince everyone that bitcoin isn\u2019t an Internet scam or a libertarian plot against the government or a digital version of goldbuggery, as various skeptics have it. Rather, it\u2019s the best thing to happen to money since the Lydians started minting coins sometime in the seventh century B.C. Coinbase isn\u2019t a bank -- technically, it\u2019s a brokerage -- but in important respects it behaves like one. Customers open accounts, through which they buy bitcoins for dollars. Coinbase holds the bitcoins. Customers spend them using a computer or a smartphone application. Coinbase makes money by charging a 1 percent fee for exchanging dollars and bitcoins. All other transactions are free. Coinbase\u2019s aim is to take a curio currency that exists only as bits on the Internet and turn it into a coin of the realm -- every realm, because part of the appeal of bitcoin is that it can cross borders as easily as e-mail. It\u2019s a big job. Reputation is everything when it comes to currency, and bitcoin\u2019s has taken some hits. In 2013, the FBI busted Silk Road, an online drug market that ran on bitcoins. In February 2014, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, collapsed, and suddenly 850,000 bitcoins, worth $500 million at the time, were just ... gone. (Two hundred thousand of the missing bitcoins later turned up.) Before and since, there have been numerous bitcoin heists, blamed on hackers, and more than a few bitcoin losses -- people literally lose their bitcoins by misplacing the code that proves ownership. If you do that, there\u2019s no reset, no more than if you drop a $100 bill through a sewer grate. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s just about making people feel safe and secure,\u201d Ehrsam says in an interview at Coinbase\u2019s headquarters. Coinbase looks like a startup, with rows of industrial-sized Apple computers on Ikea tables, except that it\u2019s on the 26th floor of a building in San Francisco\u2019s financial district, nestled among the very banks bitcoin lovers love to hate. Bitcoin is worth a makeover, Armstrong and Ehrsam say, because the currency solves so many problems that come with putting old technology, in particular credit cards, on the Internet. When consumers use bitcoins, merchants pay fees that are a fraction of what credit card companies get. Users can shop online without giving their names, never mind credit card information -- which, yes, explains Silk Road but also allows noncriminals to claw back some privacy. As for security, the bitcoin system has thwarted every attack thus far. Recent hacks of Target Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. show how the old forms of payment and transfer are ripe for replacement, bitcoin believers say. Coinbase is a bitcoin blue chip. Armstrong and Ehrsam have scored money and support from Y Combinator, the hyperselective startup booster in Silicon Valley. New York\u2013based Union Square Ventures led a $5 million investment in May 2013, and Marc Andreessen\u2019s Menlo Park, California\u2013based venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz LLC, anchored a $25 million B round in December. Andreessen may be more stoked about bitcoin than anyone else in techdom. He says it fills a void in the Internet that has existed since he and his friend Eric Bina invented the first widely used Web browser in the 1990s: a protocol for payments. He always imagined that someone would figure out how to send money as easily as data. (Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Markets, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz.) Like many West Coast entrepreneurs, Armstrong and Ehrsam relish cutting out financial middlemen and have a special scorn for credit card companies. In Armstrong\u2019s view, they entice customers with airline miles, then fleece merchants with fees. \u201cThis is the way they\u2019re innovating, playing these games,\u201d he says. Such fees add up to a big opportunity for bitcoin. Credit card and debit fees in the U.S. totaled $72 billion in 2013, says Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. Much of that could vanish if bitcoin catches on, he says. Bitcoin arrived in the world on Halloween 2008 in the form of a nine-page white paper called \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\u201d authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, a person or group of people who remains anonymous. Nakamoto unleashed the bitcoin software, all of it public, in January 2009. The system allowed for the creation of 21 million bitcoins, total, with the last ones to be released in 2140. Bitcoin lets commerce happen without an overarching authority, be it a bank that clears transactions or even a central bank that controls the money supply. It works because each bitcoin is really just a slot in a huge, peer-to-peer online ledger -- millions of slots, really, because each bitcoin, worth $373 as of yesterday, is infinitely divisible. The smallest unit so far, eight places beyond the decimal point, is called a Satoshi. It was worth about 0.0004 cent as of Sept. 18. Electronic currencies had been proposed before, but no one could figure out the double-spending problem: You can\u2019t spend the dollar in your friend\u2019s pocket, but you could spend the same electronic dollar twice if you gave it to two people at the same time. Nakamoto found a solution. No bitcoin transaction is legitimate unless it comports with all of the preceding transactions for each bitcoin involved. Every transaction for every bitcoin is available to every computer that joins the peer-to-peer network that runs the bitcoin system. Buy a watch on Overstock.com, one of the biggest retailers to take bitcoins, and the system goes to work, checking the common ledger for past transactions that prove you have the money. The purchase isn\u2019t done until all the computers on the network agree. Why does anyone devote any time to checking transactions? Because programmers earn new bitcoins for the work -- if their computers also find, by trial and error, the solution to a complex equation that the bitcoin system automatically makes harder as more computing power goes to work on it. This hurdle is designed to prevent a rogue programmer from hijacking the system. Taken together, the checking and solving is called mining bitcoins. In the beginning, people were able to mine bitcoins on desktop computers. Now, it takes huge rigs built on special chips and running in places, such as Iceland, where the electricity needed to power the machines is cheap. That magical ledger is called the blockchain, and there is no word more exciting to Silicon Valley venture capitalists these days. Andreessen and others say the blockchain could be used to keep track of not just money but anything that needs third-party verification, such as real estate contracts or stock trades. It might even track voting and guarantee one ballot per person. On a website called Proofofexistence.com, it\u2019s possible to turn a document like a lease, or even a novel, into a hash -- a code generated by an algorithm -- and load it into the bitcoin blockchain, proving that it existed at a certain time. Alec Ross, until last year the senior adviser for innovation at the U.S. State Department and now a consultant, says he loves blockchain technology, but he isn\u2019t convinced about bitcoin. One basic problem: \u201cThe unit is ridiculous,\u201d he says. At $373 per bitcoin, it\u2019s too big. Just because it\u2019s divisible into tiny pieces doesn\u2019t mean people will be comfortable with tiny pieces. \u201cIt\u2019s an important innovation in computer science,\u201d Ross says. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily going to supplant the euro.\u201d Armstrong was an early adopter of bitcoin technology. After growing up in San Jose, California, he graduated from Rice University with bachelor\u2019s degrees in economics and computer science and a master\u2019s in computer science, all in 2005. He worked in information technology for Deloitte & Touche LLP and then returned full time to a company he had founded in college, called UniversityTutor.com. He joined Airbnb, the online lodging company, in 2011, and set to work building the company\u2019s anti-fraud system. While there, he saw how hard it was for Airbnb to handle payments from around the world. Then he discovered the Nakamoto white paper and was dazzled. Here was a currency that could fly across borders via an e-mail. Proficient in a babel of computer languages, he built a digital wallet to hold bitcoins on Android phones. Already, the idea was to make bitcoin accessible, to mainstream it. He thought there was a company in this. He applied to Y Combinator. The founders of Airbnb and Reddit Inc. went through Y Combinator, as did Justin Kan, founder of the gaming platform Twitch Interactive Inc., which Amazon.com Inc. bought in August for $970 million. Armstrong won a spot in the 12-week Y Combinator session that began in April 2012. Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures was there doing office hours and met Armstrong. Until then, Wilson says, all the bitcoin guys seemed like ideologues: conspiracy theorists keen to escape what they see as the tyranny of institutions such as the U.S. Federal Reserve. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a hard-core libertarian bent,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cHe was focused on solving pragmatic problems with bitcoin.\u201d Armstrong finished Y Combinator that June, formally launched Coinbase and went looking for money. He called on Adam Draper, son of venture capitalist Tim Draper. Adam was in the midst of starting Boost VC, a Y Combinator\u2013like accelerator in San Mateo, California. He wanted to invest across categories but also to develop a specialty. \u201cWe looked at drones,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re cool, but there are two use cases: One is taco delivery, and the other is national security.\u201d Draper had heard about bitcoin. Its promise became apparent, he says, after he met Armstrong at Red Rock Coffee in Mountain View, California, a hangout for caffeine-seeking coders. They talked amid the clicking of keyboards. After hearing Armstrong out, Draper invested his own money in Coinbase and six months later decided to have Boost focus on embryonic bitcoin companies. He wants to fund 100 of them. The first big challenge Armstrong addressed was how to buy bitcoins easily. Back then, buyers and sellers gathered in parks or bars to trade cash for bits. Others wired money to brokers, often abroad, and hoped. It was hard to turn dollars, or any other currency, into bitcoins. Armstrong solved that by gaining access to the Automated Clearing House, or ACH, the electronic rails on which certain financial transactions run in the U.S. Employers use ACH to deposit checks in employee accounts, for example. To get on, a company needs a bank to sponsor it. Bitcoin companies struggle, Armstrong says, because banks worry that with bitcoin, you can\u2019t know your customer and prevent money laundering, two things regulators require. Armstrong scored a banking relationship with Silicon Valley Bank in October 2012. A month later, customers could transfer money from a U.S. bank account to Coinbase and buy bitcoins. No muss, no fuss. Circle Internet Financial Ltd., a Boston-based bitcoin brokerage, also offers ACH transfers. In New York, Ehrsam had fallen under Nakamoto\u2019s spell. It happened when a friend from Duke University, where Ehrsam had studied computer science, pulled up the white paper. Ehrsam read that and then everything else he could discover about bitcoin. \u201cYou could find nobody in person who could explain how bitcoin worked,\u201d he says. He came across Armstrong\u2019s work on the Internet. They corresponded, and Ehrsam started buying and selling bitcoins, sometimes on his phone from the bathroom at Goldman Sachs. \u201cWe traded it for fun and some profit,\u201d he says. Ehrsam flew to San Francisco and met Armstrong at The Creamery, a coffee shop popular with techies because it\u2019s near the Caltrain station, where people arrive from Silicon Valley for meetings in the city. Both were a little guarded, Ehrsam recalls. \u201cI could tell that the mental horsepower was there,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cWe decided to work on something for a week.\u201d They hit it off, and Ehrsam joined Coinbase in November 2012, taking the title of co-founder. Back then, some 15,000 people had wallets on Coinbase, and they bought and sold about $1 million in bitcoins a month, Armstrong says. He and Ehrsam ran the thing by themselves out of a two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco. At the time, one bitcoin sold for about $13. People still used a whole one to buy a pizza, if they could find a shop that accepted it. The price of a bitcoin rose for most of 2013, peaking at $1,137 on Nov. 29. By year\u2019s end, Coinbase had more than 600,000 users, and it got a further $25 million from venture capitalists, with Andreessen Horowitz putting in the biggest chunk. The success of bitcoin, and Coinbase, will depend in part on whether big merchants start accepting it. Armstrong and Ehrsam are pitching them. So far, they\u2019ve convinced computer maker Dell Inc., travel company Expedia Inc. and software maker Intuit Inc. to take bitcoins and to open merchant accounts on Coinbase. The system will have to prove secure, too, for the general public to get on board. Bitcoin \u201cmanages to function in a very adversarial environment,\u201d says Paul Kocher, president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, a part of semiconductor designer Rambus Inc. By that, he means that everyone wants to attack it, because it\u2019s money. Bitcoin uses something called public-key cryptography, which requires two keys, each a string of numbers and letters. One is public and identifies the sender or recipient in a bitcoin transaction. The other key is private and is used to verify, or sign, the transaction. Unlike a Facebook password, the private key can\u2019t be retrieved with an e-mail if it\u2019s lost. Once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. Bitcoin seems as futuristic as a light saber until it comes to keeping hold of the private key. Then it seems as ancient and clunky as gold. Fearing hackers, many people print out their private keys, delete them from their computers and put them in safes. Many a bitcoin has been lost to hard drives crashing, according to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cFor the average consumer, bitcoin is a risky proposition,\u201d says Mercedes Tunstall, a partner at law firm Ballard Spahr LLP in Washington and an expert on data security. Hackers can get private keys off a person\u2019s computer, she says, because people don\u2019t protect them properly. \u201cIf you and I are walking down the street with cash in our pockets, we know how to keep it out of view,\u201d she says. \u201cWith bitcoin, there is no way for the average consumer to protect themselves.\u201d Coinbase addresses that by keeping everything in house. Coinbase users never even see their private keys. They just have accounts with passwords, and those passwords are backed up with ever-changing codes sent to their phones. Coinbase, in turn, puts many of the bitcoins it holds in what the company refers to as cold storage. It splits individual private keys, writes them onto USB drives and prints them on paper, and puts everything in vaults and safety deposit boxes at various locations. No one person can retrieve the codes. \u201cWe don\u2019t want someone to come in here, kidnap Fred and me and get a quorum of these keys,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed it in a way where that can\u2019t happen.\u201d Many bitcoin lovers, Ehrsam and Armstrong included, make endless comparisons between e-mail and bitcoin. One sends data, the other money. People freaked out about the security of e-mail in the beginning, and today they send all manner of private information electronically because it\u2019s proved easy to use and secure, provided basic security protocols are observed. Armstrong and Ehrsam say the same thing will happen with bitcoin. The chance for merchants to avoid credit card fees of 2 percent to 3 percent and the ability to send money for free, anywhere, will attract more and more users, and more and more merchants, they say. What seems strange and scary now will become familiar, and bitcoin will go from curio to currency.

Route 66 Ventures LLC, Tellurian Capital Management LLP and Nyca Partners are among the investors, Robert Sams, founder and chief executive officer of London-based Clearmatics, said on Wednesday. The backing is the latest sign of interest in using blockchain, the software behind bitcoin, to make\xa0transferring and tracking the ownership of bonds, loans and other assets faster and cheaper and to minimize operational risks. \u201cAs a hedge fund ourselves, we can see the very significant benefits that this new digital settlement coin and the related distributed ledger market architecture will bring to the table in securities trading,\u201d said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner at London-based Tellurian Capital. UBS engaged Clearmatics in September to help develop a digital coin based on blockchain to settle trades and make cross-border payments. The Swiss bank, the world\u2019s biggest manager of money for the rich, wants to team up with other financial institutions and regulators to develop a product for the industry that would be backed by real-world currencies and central bank accounts.\xa0 Clearmatics, founded in February, has shown the concept to other companies and it has been well-received, Sams said. Even so, blockchain startups are proliferating, and it may be years before the technology leads to widescale change in the industry.\xa0Visa Inc., Nasdaq, Citi Ventures and others recently invested $30 million in Chain Inc., while Banco Santander SA in July sank $4 million into Ripple Labs Inc. Both startups are based in San Francisco. Blockchain is an open-source software code that uses advanced encryption to record bitcoin transactions. Banks are seeking different applications. Powered by a network of computers, it allows two parties to exchange information securely within minutes, with no need for a third party. At present, banks rely on workers to verify and process transactions, an expensive business that can take days. UBS has identified 20 to 25 potential uses for blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology, said Oliver Bussmann, the Zurich-based bank\u2019s chief technology officer. Chris Murphy, global co-head of currencies, rates and credit at UBS, said blockchain represents a fundamental rethinking of the business process that could replace swathes of wholesale and retail-banking activities. \u201cAcross the industry, there are billions of costs that could be at play here,\u2019\u2019 Murphy said in an interview in Zurich last month. He is eager to stay close to developments, he said. UBS decided early on to abandon a purely in-house model for innovation and become part of the fintech \u201cecosystem,\u2019\u2019 as Bussmann describes it. In April, the bank installed a team of specialists in Level39, a collective workspace for technology startups in London\u2019s Canary Wharf. The Level39 team, led by Senior Innovation Manager Alex Batlin, a computer scientist, is also working with the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation on using its blockchain for so-called smart contracts. These are computer programs that automatically execute commercial agreements, for example a bond that periodically pays interest to a holder. \u201cMany of these startups have interesting ideas but some don\u2019t quite know how to apply it to real-world business problems,\u201d Murphy said of the industry in general. \u201cThe way we\u2019re thinking about engaging is very much a partnership, where we offer them some advice on the application of their technology but leave development to them.\u2019\u2019 The first order of business is to develop a standardized architecture for private ledgers, as opposed to the public one used for the bitcoin, according to Bussmann. UBS was one of the first of more than two dozen banks that joined forces with R3 CEV, a New York-based startup, to set up a blockchain for participants. The other founding members were JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Plc.  \u201cWe are in the very, very early phase stage,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe race from my perspective is still open. We are putting our eggs in different baskets.\u2019\u2019', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/crobertsCH', 'name': u'Cindy Roberts', 'twitterhandle': u'crobertsCH'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-18/ubs-blockchain-partner-clearmatics-raises-funds-for-digital-coin', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 18, 7, 22, 58, 644000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'UBS Blockchain Partner Clearmatics Taps Investors for Funds'}, {'articleText': u'  Peter Randall, known for helping unleash a new era of competition for European stock exchanges in 2007, is seeking to upend the status quo yet again. This time, the goal is using the underlying technology for the digital currency bitcoin to dramatically speed up the transfer of assets. Randall, the former chief executive officer of the Chi-X Europe stock market, has been hired as the chief operating officer of SETL, according to a statement Monday. The startup has developed a payment and settlement system based on blockchain, the software ledger that drives bitcoin. \u201cClearing and settlement processes are fragmented, cumbersome, costly and in need of technological innovation and simplification,\u201d Randall said in the statement. \u201cWe are currently in discussion with a number of first-tier institutions who are looking to commercialize blockchain technology.\u201d He\u2019s the latest trading executive to endorse the use of blockchain in finance, joining a list that includes former New York Stock Exchange head Duncan Niederauer and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. CEO Bob Greifeld. It takes days to transfer assets such as loans or bonds, and that can tie up money in a bank\u2019s back office. The often-overlooked post-trade process costs the industry as much as $80 billion a year, according to SETL, which cited an Oliver Wyman report. SETL aims to initially target the payments business, and then move into financial markets like foreign exchange, bonds and possibly stocks. While cryptocurrencies tout their anonymity, SETL enables the identification of its users. SETL says its technology will be faster than bitcoin\u2019s blockchain implementation, which can process about 7 transactions per second -- though other blockchain enthusiasts also want to speed that up.

Wall Street professionals endorsed blockchain in a recent Greenwich Associates survey, with 94 percent saying it could be used in finance. Earlier this year, Nasdaq joined a clutch of companies seeking to adapt blockchain for mainstream finance, saying it would \u201cleverage blockchain technology as part of an enterprise-wide initiative.\u201d \u201cWe also plan to announce further blockchain initiatives in the future,\u201d Greifeld said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. \u201cThe application of blockchain technology within Nasdaq\u2019s private market aims to modernize, streamline and really secure cumbersome administrative functions,\u201d Last month, Symbiont, which plans to use blockchain to make it quicker and cheaper to transfer assets between buyers and sellers, raised $1.25 million from financial industry heavyweights including former New York Stock Exchange chief Duncan Niederauer, former Citadel LLC executive Matt Andresen, and two co-founders of high-frequency trading firm Getco LLC, Dan Tierney and Stephen Schuler.

Draper, the co-founder of investment firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, will work with startup Vaurum to help provide access to bitcoins in developing economies and use the about 30,000 bitcoins won in the auction as a source of liquidity, according to a statement that Vaurum posted on publishing service Medium today. \u201cBitcoin frees people from trying to operate in a modern market economy with weak currencies,\u201d Draper said in the statement. \u201cWith the help of Vaurum and this newly purchased bitcoin, we expect to be able to create new services that can provide liquidity and confidence to markets that have been hamstrung by weak currencies.\u201d The auction attracted 45 bidders, including New York brokerage SecondMarket Inc., and 63 bids were submitted during the 12 hours of the auction on June 27, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. The agency, which didn\u2019t disclose the winner\u2019s identity, said yesterday that it notified the bidder and transferred the money. The auction of 29,656 bitcoins, part of more than 144,000 the FBI transferred to U.S. Marshals after shutting down the Silk Road marketplace and arresting its operator last year, represented a rare opportunity to secure a large cache of the virtual currency. While the actual price of the winning bid isn\u2019t known, the cache sold on June 30 was worth about $19 million at current exchange prices. Vaurum is a Palo Alto, California-based startup that enables companies including banks and brokerages to trade and store bitcoins on behalf of customers. Earlier this year it raised $4 million in seed funding from investors including Draper, Battery Ventures and America Online Inc. co-founder Steve Case. Vaurum said it was incubated last year by Boost, which invests in bitcoin startups and was founded by Tim Draper\u2019s son, Adam Draper. \u201cAll in on Vaurum, Bitcoin, and Bitcoin adding a tremendous amount of value in the developing world,\u201d Adam Draper said in an e-mail. Vaurum said it has started trading platforms in emerging markets where it is also difficult to get access to bitcoin. \u201cCollectively, we\u2019ve been brainstorming to come up with new ways to help grow global bitcoin adoption,\u201d Vaurum Chief Executive Officer Avish Bhama said in the statement. \u201cWhat we came up with is a way to leverage our exchanges and utilize the auctioned pool of bitcoins, as well as market making strategies, to help provide liquidity in these underserved markets.\u201d Draper\u2019s and Vaurum\u2019s vision of bitcoin as a more stable alternative to some currencies stands in contrast to executives like JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett who have expressed doubts about bitcoin. Bankers including Dimon, 58, have predicted bitcoins probably won\u2019t last after governments subject them to rules and standards akin to those for other payment systems. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not around in 10 or 20 years,\u201d Buffett, the billionaire chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., told CNBC in March. \u201cIt does not meet the test of a currency.\u201d SecondMarket, Rangeley Capital, Pantera Capital Management, Bitcoin Shop and Coinbase Inc. all said they were among bidders in the auction with offers that fell short. Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera, said that the spectacle of the U.S. government auctioning bitcoins suggested that \u201csupply creates its own demand.\u201d \u201cThe publicity created a tremendous amount of demand,\u201d Morehead wrote in an e-mail. \u201cWe had several large new players bid.\u201d Micky Malka, founder of Ribbit Capital, a venture capital fund which buys bitcoins and backs bitcoin companies, echoed that sentiment today. \u201cWe bid, and we are happy to see that there are a lot of institutional buyers interested in bitcoin, which clearly have a lot potential,\u201d Malka said. Because liquidity on the exchanges is low -- a trade of 500 bitcoins can move prices -- the auction offered a chance to avoid paying a premium. More bitcoins may be sold later, U.S. Marshals have said. The sale excludes bitcoins the government obtained from computer hardware owned by Ross William Ulbricht, who the U.S. said ran Silk Road. The marketplace was an online bazaar where anonymous users allegedly bought and sold heroin, LSD, phony passports and computer hacking services. Ulbricht is contesting charges and filed a claim asserting ownership of the bitcoins. The price of bitcoins skyrocketed in 2013 to $1,147 from around $12 as technologists and speculators flocked to the digital currency, before dropping sharply amid regulatory crackdowns in China, Russia and elsewhere. One bitcoin fetched about $644 yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which represents an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. Bitcoins, which exist as software and aren\u2019t controlled by any single authority or country, emerged in 2009 out of a paper authored under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, retailers selling everything from hotel bookings to psychiatric services to luxury homes have started accepting bitcoins.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-01/bitcoin-auction-ends-single-bidder-wins-entire-cache', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 2, 15, 25, 13, 374000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'VC Tim Draper Wins Entire Cache in Bitcoin Auction'}, {'articleText': u'  The former head of the bankrupt Mt. Gox Co. bitcoin exchange was originally believed by U.S. investigators to be the secret mastermind behind the Silk Road online drug marketplace, an agent who infiltrated the website told jurors at the trial of the man prosecutors now accuse of running it. Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a Department of Homeland Security special agent, testified Thursday that he believed in mid-2013 that Mark Karpeles, then Mt. Gox\u2019s chief executive officer, was also head of Silk Road, where buyers used bitcoins to purchase drugs and other illegal items anonymously. Ross William Ulbricht, 30, who was arrested in October 2013 and charged with running Silk Road under the pseudonym \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d is on trial in Manhattan federal court on charges of conspiracy and Internet drug trafficking. Ulbricht claims he gave up control of the site within months of starting it. His lawyer, Joshua Dratel, questioned Der-Yeghiayan in an attempt to persuade jurors that Karpeles was behind Silk Road and set up Ulbricht to take the blame. Dratel asked the agent about statements he drafted in May and August in 2013 to get a search warrant for Karpeles\u2019s e-mails. \u201cYou were ready to swear that there was probable cause to believe that those Gmail accounts contained evidence of instrumentalities of narcotics trafficking and money laundering, right?\u201d Dratel asked. \u201cCorrect,\u201d Der-Yeghiayan answered. Der-Yeghiayan said that at the time he believed Karpeles, whose company was the world\u2019s biggest exchanger of bitcoins, set up Silk Road to stimulate demand for the virtual currency and drive up its value. He said he concluded that Karpeles, who was born and educated in France, ran Silk Road while a Canadian associate named Ashley Barr was the online voice of the site. \u201cI am not and have never been \u2018Dread Pirate Roberts,\u2019\u201d Karpeles, who lives in Japan, said Thursday in an e-mail to Bloomberg News. \u201cThe investigation reached that conclusion already -- this is why I am not the one sitting during the Silk Road trial, and I can only feel defense attorney Joshua Dratel trying everything he can to point the attention away from his client. I have nothing to do with Silk Road and do not condone what has been happening there.\u201d Der-Yeghiayan, who was investigating from Chicago, testified that in May 2013, Homeland Security in Baltimore seized more than $3 million from the account of a Karpeles company, Mutum Sigillum. In July 2013, representatives of the Baltimore office met with Karpeles\u2019s lawyers and were told he was willing to tell the government who ran Silk Road. Outside the jury\u2019s presence, Dratel told U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, who\u2019s overseeing the trial, that Karpeles was seeking to avoid a criminal charge by pointing the finger at Ulbricht. Forrest dismissed the jury of six men and six women early so that she could consider arguments from both sides over what additional evidence they may hear about the government\u2019s investigation of Karpeles. Der-Yeghiayan will continue his testimony when the trial resumes Jan. 20. Ulbricht faces as long as life in prison if convicted. The trial started Jan. 13 and may last as long as six weeks. Der-Yeghiayan said agents maintained at least a dozen buyer and seller accounts on the illicit website, taking over the online identities of cooperating witnesses including a woman who went by the name \u201cScout.\u201d The agent said investigators often didn\u2019t know who they were dealing with. In June 2013, Der-Yeghiayan expressed frustration over the uncertain identities on Silk Road. \u201cSheesh, who\u2019s on first?\u201d he asked. The government claims more than 1 million drug sales were done through Silk Road. The site barred ads for child pornography, weapons of mass destruction, counterfeit currency, murder-for-hire and stolen credit cards, Der-Yeghiayan said. In testimony Thursday and the day before, Der-Yeghiayan told jurors he worked as a Silk Road site administrator for several months as part of the government\u2019s investigation, communicating online with Dread Pirate Roberts and coworkers known as Libertas, Samesamebutdifferent and Inigo, without knowing their real identities. Der-Yeghiayan said he used the name Cirrus, concealing the fact that he was a law-enforcement agent. Ulbricht took his online identity from a character in the 1987 film \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d according to prosecutors. In the film, \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d is a name used by a series of pirates who pass the identity to their chosen successors when they retire. Der-Yeghiayan testified that Silk Road\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts used a unique cryptographic key consisting of a long string of characters, to identify himself to users of the site. In his questioning, Dratel suggested the key could be passed from one person to another, like a car key or file key. Silk Road was operated on the Tor network, which routes communications through a series of computers to allow users to be anonymous. Prosecutors claim Ulbricht tried to arrange the murders of at least six people who threatened his multimillion-dollar business. No murders were actually carried out, prosecutors have said. Ulbricht is charged separately in federal court in Baltimore for one of the alleged plots. Before sending jurors home, Forrest added a new element to her instruction to jurors not to discuss the case: \u201cDon\u2019t go watching \u2018The Princess Bride\u2019 this weekend.\u201d The case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 14-cr-00068, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The murder-for-hire case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 13-cr-00222, U.S. District Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore).', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-16/mt-gox-s-karpeles-targeted-first-as-silk-road-s-dread-pirate-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 16, 1, 50, 43, 346000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Mt.

Heading into the weekend we find ourselves wondering once again what things are going to look like on Monday. It\u2019s stunning how quickly things can unspool, and when you\u2019re in the news business on a day like yesterday, it\u2019s kind of like being a first responder. You watch the world coming undone in real time and it\u2019s something you can\u2019t ever unsee. You guys are on the ride with us on these kinds of days. You make the world go around, or at least help to spin the wheel, and we watch it all with you -- plus what you do -- and feed it back to you. It\u2019s why you, like us, are always just a bit somewhere else in whatever room you\u2019re in, because The Others -- our family and friends -- they don\u2019t see the world turning in the ways we see it. They don\u2019t understand. How do we explain our distraction during the kids\u2019 pool party tomorrow, or when those friends stop by for the long-planned cocktail party, that there\u2019s someone either in Russia or Ukraine with a rocket launcher capable of reaching 30,000 feet and that they know how to use it? Or that in the next 48 hours or so either side there is going to be so convinced that the other shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 -- God, poor Malaysia Air -- that all gloves will be off in the region by the Sunday morning conference call? Sure, they\u2019ve heard the news. Do they feel it? If it\u2019s not full metal jacket in Donetsk by Monday it will be in Gaza, which is a topic we have scrupulously avoided because it\u2019s pretty much the third rail. The ground war has started there, and without getting on either side\u2019s case about the crap each is pulling, we would like to hear NBC News explain why it pulled its correspondent in Gaza, Ayman Mohyeldin. Was the network concerned about his mental health after he witnessed the death of four Palestinian boys cut down in front of him moments after he had been playing soccer with them on a beach? Or was his reporting so even that it offended those with a different set of principles in journalism? NBC poached him from Al Jazeera for a reason after his coverage of Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza in 2008, so what changed? His social media postings? Then, just as all this stuff was screaming around the newswires, and the markets/you were telling us you\u2019ve have enough, there\u2019s a lockdown at the White House and you begin to start thinking things to yourself -- weird things, the same kinds of things that were swirling in your head around 9:37 a.m. EDT on Sept. 11, 2001: What exactly might we have going on here? Maybe you think that\u2019s a little extreme, but it isn\u2019t to us. We have to be ready for this kind of thing now, probably forever. So once again we find that while there\u2019s a mostly sunny weekend to come, there are clouds in the forecast. *** Friday\u2019s economic indicators are the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey at 9:55 a.m. EDT and LEI at 10 a.m. Earnings releases are due from Honeywell, Johnson Controls, GE, Bank of New York Mellon, Interpublic Group and ITT Educational Services. *** - AbbVie and Shire have a deal at about 32 billion pounds, or $54.8 billion. - The threatened LIRR strike has been averted with a tentative deal, so it\u2019s game on in the Hamptons this weekend. - Talks in Vienna on Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions head into the weekend and may be extended past the deadline on Sunday, July 20. - The insider-trading probe circling the House Ways and Means Committee extends to dozens of hedge funds, investment advisers and others. - Meg Whitman was named Hewlett-Packard\u2019s chairman as Ralph Whitworth steps down to fight cancer. Wasn\u2019t sure which one of those to lead with. - Jamie Dimon is $37 million richer, on paper. - Christie killed in Iowa. - Berlusconi\u2019s verdict in his appeal of convictions for abuse of power and engaging a minor in prostitution is expected today. - Typhoon Rammasun has moved on to China after killing 54 in the Philippines. - The body of Harry Devert, a stock broker from Pelham, New York, was found in Mexico following his disappearance during a motorcycle trip to the World Cup. - Get a good look at the Manhattan skyline now. It will be different soon. - Richard Florida and researchers from the University of California find that states with pro-business policies have the widest wealth gaps. - New York City has formed a task force to deal with the Central American child migrants who are arriving to the city. - Seven are dead in Poland after they all fell into a septic tank. - Happy Nelson Mandela Day. *** The TV people have a potent guest roster today to discuss the downed Malaysian airliner and events in Gaza, including Representative Mike Turner, the Ohio Republican and member of the House Armed Services Committee, at 8 a.m. EDT; Roman Popadiuk, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, at 10 a.m.; Grover Norquist, just for levity, at 10:30 a.m.; Daniel Baker, CEO of Flight Aware, at 1 p.m., Ido Aharoni, general consul of Israel at 3 p.m.; and Representative Peter King, the New York Republican, at 3:30. *** It\u2019s an easy line to draw between the U.S. coal industry and commercial fishing. The analogy is thin, admittedly, but both are based on a finite resource. Granted, you\u2019re not disfiguring nature as much or as visibly in large-scale commercial fishing, and we don\u2019t rely on fish for powering homes and industry, but the same lamentations arise from the boat captains that come from the coal miners when you try to tell them that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t sustainable. It\u2019s a hard lesson they\u2019ve learned in eastern Kentucky, Mark Drajem shows us, and it\u2019s a lesson that\u2019s likely to come in time in Wyoming, where the living is easy as it used to be in Kentucky\u2019s coal heyday (well, sort of). They\u2019re almost making fracking money in Wyoming, and the civic leaders have the enviable task of figuring how to spend it all, or spend it most wisely. But it all just can\u2019t go on forever, and like the fishermen, the short-sightedness of clinging to what amounts to a 19th century technology makes little sense. However, sense can be in short supply in places like these. Have you gotten wind of \u201crolling coal\u201d yet? (For the record, there\u2019s no coal involved. Or sense.) \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to rely on something else,\u201d Harry Gibson, a former miner, told Drajem. \u201cBut we\u2019ve gotten so dependent on coal, it\u2019s like we\u2019re on drugs.\u201d Just say no. *** Why do people do some of the things they do? Running marathons, climbing mountains, deep-frying their Thanksgiving turkeys -- what are you all trying to prove? Isn\u2019t life difficult enough? We\u2019re only half-serious. The other half is in awe of people who do those things or, in the case of the turkeys, attempt them. Add swimming the English Channel to the list and meet our London-based sports editor Sara Marley, who turned 39 again yesterday and who will celebrate by making the swim sometime in the next several days, depending on conditions. Marley was a water rat growing up and, reading her story today, you get the sense there are few places she feels more comfortable, but come on -- more comfortable than in front of the television? We told her it was difficult to comprehend what she\u2019s undertaking. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t either,\u201d she said with a laugh yesterday. Marley has a happiness and brightness in her voice that\u2019s reassuring. It leaves you feeling she\u2019s going to be just fine. In fact, this is not her first rodeo. Her longest swim up to now was a 15.1-mile (24.3 kilometers) tour around Cape May at the southern tip of New Jersey that took her 8 hours and 11 minutes. Like runners, once you do that, you want to go a little farther. She\u2019s estimating 12 to 14 hours to make it the 21 miles to France. \u201cIn some ways you know what it\u2019s going to be like -- because I\u2019ve done long swims, I\u2019ve done sea swims, I\u2019ve done eight-hour swims -- so on the one hand I kind of have an idea, and on the other hand I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019ll be like either.\u201d So, Sara? Why? \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest one to answer, and it\u2019s not \u2018because it\u2019s there.\u2019 It\u2019s because...\u201d She drifts for a moment. The reasons \u201call sound really conceited.\u201d She drifts for another second or two. \u201cBecause I think I can do it.\u201d *** This is almost like shooting fish in a barrel, but it turns out that You Guys -- our customers, whom we just surveyed recently -- are far less conflicted morally about investing in weed and weaponry than your counterparts in Europe and Asia. It pretty much comes down to one thing, Oliver Renick reports, and we think you know what that one thing is since you\u2019re the people who replied: money. If there\u2019s money to be made, a certain moral flexibility is justified. Look: Guns are legal. They are legal. They\u2019re legal like knives and bricks and lawn darts and -- what? Screw it, we\u2019re on a roll. -- and not lawn darts but cigarettes and alcohol and cattle prods and we could go on forever. Is there a discussion to be had about all the various models of that legal product, and whether we need the models that escape detection at security points or those that could mow down a platoon of law enforcement officers before needing to reload? Probably, yeah. But that\u2019s a different column, and besides we have Bloomberg View for that. As for the weed, everyone reading this who hasn\u2019t inhaled or at least had a contact high a minimum of twice your life, raise your hand. (Not you, Jeff Green.) Thought so. Americans are changing their minds about marijuana and gay marriage and expectations of privacy and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d and a hundred other things. *** The Bloomberg Global Poll of You Guys also has a bad read on bitcoins, with more than half of you saying prices are at bubble level and 14 percent saying it\u2019s close to one. Given that bitcoins opened 2013 at $13 and were trading this week at $625, it\u2019s a logical attitude. You could buy stock in Cynk with that. (Not really.) But while titans of finance like Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett express doubt about the digital currency\u2019s continued existence, the payment system continues to gather acceptance at companies, Olga Kharif reports. A total of 63,000 businesses now take bitcoins as payment, including Expedia, Dish Network and Overstock.com. Starting tomorrow in Denmark, you\u2019ll be able to buy the digital-currency NXT with dollars or euros and buy the krone and other Nordic money with NXT. If only you could buy weed and guns with bitcoins. Won\u2019t be long now. *** We\u2019ll start out the weekend box office preview with \u201cPlanes: Fire & Rescue,\u201d a Disney animation that continues its practice of giving voice to inanimate objects (toys, cars, etc.), this time airplanes and helicopters and earth-moving vehicles, and drops them into the middle of what\u2019s becoming (in real life) a summer ritual: wildfires. The script (in the trailer, at least) follows the trusted vehicles of a \u201cTop Gun\u201d movie (See what we did there? Vehicles?), with cocky alpha males, uncertain underdogs, and peripheral characters for contour, coming together to overcome adversity, backed by a soaring soundtrack. This is one of those movies that parents dread, the kind of movie your moppets will want you to play for them over and over and over and over -- every damn day -- until you know every line by heart and it starts infecting your dreams. Next is \u201cThe Purge: Anarchy,\u201d this weekend\u2019s dystopian movie. It\u2019s a sequel to \u201cThe Purge,\u201d which took a $3 million budget and turned it into a $34 million take on its opening weekend last year. The allegory bleeds through the trailer, helped by the red, white and blue of the title screens, indicating themes of class warfare in a plot about a government-sanctioned night of lawlessness that ends with ragtag group of average Americans captured and brought for slaughter before a select group of wealthy. Think 1 Percenters meets \u201cThe Hunger Games.\u201d Last, there\u2019s the comedy \u201cSex Tape.\u201d Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel are a couple who make that ultimate mistake, which you can surmise from the title, and their frantic efforts to prevent friends, coworkers and relatives from seeing it. But in a modern twist, it\u2019s not on tape. \u201cHow do you forget to erase your sex tape?!\u201d Diaz shrieks at Segel. \u201cIt went up to the cloud!\u201d \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get it down from the cloud?\u201d \u201cNobody understands the cloud!\u201d *** Hey, Tiger. Look at you! Sorry, Rory, but c\u2019mon, it\u2019s Tiger, on the prowl. Three shots back and 3-under after the first round at the British Open will put a charge in everyone, Woods especially. There\u2019s probably nothing that could take a little bit of the edge off the English-speaking world this weekend more than watching the old man start making the scene -- short of people ceasing to shoot at things and each other, that is. This might be just the golf course for Woods to mount some kind of comeback. You can roll the stupid ball for hundreds of yards with a bump-and-run game on these links courses, which might take a little pressure and pain off his ailing back. Dude can just crank it for 300 yards and play miniature golf the rest of the way. But there\u2019s a nice storyline also behind Rory McIlroy, who leads the field at Royal Liverpool with a 6-under-par 66, because he, too, has foundered lately. And we have a soft spot for Jim Furyk, who was born just a few miles from the Opening Line bureau and who sits two strokes back with Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott. Could be a good tournament. We\u2019ll see by Monday. *** But Monday will just be the start of another miserable week at the office for the boys on their bicycles in France. At least they\u2019ll be in the mountains by the end of the day; it\u2019s more difficult to crash going up mountains. Not so going down them, however. Yesterday, it was the Norwegian sprinter Alexander Kristoff who outlasted Peter Sagan for his first stage win at the Tour de France while handing Sagan his fourth second-place finish. Today the men meet the Alps, running 197.5 kilometers (123 miles) from Saint-\xc9tienne to Chamrousse, and a hard and cruel tour so far now officially gets harder and crueler.

Nothing, it seemed, had emerged to rival the underground marketplace known as Silk Road, shut down by U.S. law enforcement in 2013 for dealing in drugs, phony passports and services that might make Craigslist blush. But -- no matter. Scandals that might ordinarily doom a startup something-or-other roll off the back of bitcoin, which looks determined to stick around for a while. That\u2019s certainly the belief of Mineyuki Fukuda, the \u201csecond-term lawmaker on an obscure subcommittee\u201d who has \u201csingle-handedly made Japan an oasis for bitcoin entrepreneurs,\u201d Pavel Alpeyev and Jason Clenfield report today. To get around Japan\u2019s banking laws, Fukuda defined bitcoin not as a currency or a commodity but as a \u201cdigital recorded value,\u201d a feat of verbal dexterity that serves to highlight bitcoin\u2019s still-uncertain footing. After rocketing to $1,137 a share last November, then see-sawing for a while, bitcoin has reached a relative stasis at around $380. That means the 50,000 bitcoins being auctioned today by the U.S. Marshals Service are worth about $19 million. Those bitcoins were seized -- in the virtual sense of the word -- from files on computers belonging to Ross Ulbricht, whom the U.S. has charged as the creator and first operator of Silk Road. (Ulbricht says they have the wrong man.) In June, the marshals service auctioned an initial batch of 30,000 Ulbricht bitcoins, all of which were won by Tim Draper, co-founder of investment firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. It might seem a stretch to many of us, but Draper sees big things ahead for bitcoin -- as an alternative to troubled currencies in emerging nations, as an efficient vehicle for cash transfers in the U.S. -- even, in the future, as \u201cthe main currency of the world,\u201d he told Bloomberg Television\u2019s Emily Chang in July. \u201cThis is as transformative to finance as the Internet was to information and communication,\u201d he said. Draper\u2019s word carries some weight. His father, William Draper III, co-founded the West Coast\u2019s first venture-capital firm, Draper Richards. Tim Draper wants everybody to \u201cgo buy a bitcoin and see how it works.\u201d Just don\u2019t try that at today\u2019s auction. The smallest block is 2,000 bitcoins. And Draper has made clear he\u2019s in it to win it again. *** U.S. economic indicators today include initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. EST and Bloomberg consumer comfort at 9:45 a.m. Today\u2019s U.S. earnings reports include Kroger, Sears, Barnes & Noble, and Dollar General before the bell.

Super-low interest rates, quantitative easing -- been there, done that. The question is not so much whether the Federal Reserve\u2019s post-2008 recovery plan will be implemented in other countries, but what\u2019s taking them so long. In the case of the European Central Bank and its president, Mario Draghi, Jeff Black and Stefan Riecher offer some answers.

There\u2019s an efficient market for crocodiles in South Africa now after the success of last month\u2019s auction of more than 8,000 of the toothy beasts, and unfortunately for them, not only they do they wear well, they taste like chicken. Tshepiso Mokhema reports the breeders, so-called subadults of seven to 10 years old, sold for about $1,100 each. These are still pretty small, only about 440 pounds, or 200 kilos. The little nippers went for $75 each. We could afford that, though only on the condition that it gets nowhere near 400 pounds, let alone the roughly 2,000 pounds one is capable of accumulating. With the sale also of fertilized eggs, one could say they have a futures market as well. Thus a liquid, transparent market in cold-blooded animals has been established after years of private trading. Who would have thought crocodile farmers could achieve what the municipal-bond market can\u2019t? *** Imagine trying to be an accountant right now with what\u2019s going on down on Capitol Hill. Actually, don\u2019t bother trying. We\u2019ve got one for you. Bill, take it away: \u201cThe fact that these nitwits are in Washington on Dec. 3 deciding some tax bills that impact on all of 2014 -- I mean, it is ridiculous. It\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d This is Bill O\u2019Connor, CPA, a partner at Siana Carr O\u2019Connor & Lynam LLP in the Philadelphia suburb of Paoli. He\u2019s the kind of guy who has to bend over and take it when Dave Camp and Congress\u2019s tax geniuses approach their legislation like \u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice.\u201d Congress likes to talk a lot about how to help American businesses, but we can\u2019t think of a single area of greater importance for a business, let alone any individual, than knowing where the chalk lines are and making them consistent. O\u2019Connor\u2019s been in the business for more than 35 years, a member of the Pennsylvania and American Institutes of Certified Public Accountants, and you\u2019ve got to figure he\u2019s seen a lot in that time. Can\u2019t be too often he gets that riled up. But here\u2019s a look inside his reality as Congress resurrects dozens of tax breaks for, effectively, one month only. \u201cWe have a three-and-a-half-month window to file both the corporate and individual tax returns -- actually, the corporates are two-and-a-half months,\u201d O\u2019Connor says. Congress is \u201cgoing to shorten that window by a month because our software producers won\u2019t be able to adjust to the new tax law until they get it. And we can\u2019t do the returns without software because the IRS says you can\u2019t send us returns unless they\u2019re electronically filed.\u201d That got us wondering about the software company. Turns out, they\u2019ve got it covered. Because what choice do they have? \u201cWe have teams in place for this kind of thing, particularly for this kind of end-of-year legislation,\u201d says Eric Scott, spokesman for Wolters Kluwer, CCH, which makes the Pro System FX tax-filing software O\u2019Connor\u2019s firm uses. \u201cI could bring up the fiscal-cliff example. That happened over the stretch between Christmas and New Year\u2019s (Eve/Day), and we had people working -- Christmas and New Year\u2019s -- to update everything. I think that was more than 50 tax laws that were being decided at that point.\u201d So, good for them. They keep calm and carry on, but it\u2019s guys like O\u2019Connor who are going to be sleepless for weeks just to handle an entire season\u2019s worth of work just because our lawmakers wouldn\u2019t do theirs. *** Normally, July in the mountains of France\u2019s Department of Savoie is about hot sun graced by cool breezes and cooler nights, and it is almost unheard of to find air conditioning anywhere there. Maybe you\u2019ll find some in Paris, but not in the countryside. During one trip to visit the in-laws a few years ago, though, France and much of Europe was gripped in a nasty heat wave. It didn\u2019t even have the palliative properties that you\u2019d get from humidity. This was dry, hot air, the kind that made your eyeballs hot. With no A/C, sleeping would be impossible for this American, so we wondered where the fans were kept. No fans either. When the in-laws returned home from a little trip they\u2019d been on when we had arrived, Monsieur entered his house and saw a typical tabletop oscillating fan sweeping lazily back and forth. He stood rooted for a moment, unsure what to make of it, before arriving at the conclusion that this was a brilliant idea. And one that never would have occurred to him. Well, maybe, but it\u2019s not in the French character, from what we\u2019ve observed in marriage to it, to seize a problem by the throat and fix it without delay. It\u2019s a culture that seems to foster enduring one\u2019s problems with grace (and a shrug), and it\u2019s enviable in a way because there\u2019s a whiff of maturity about it. That is, until it starts really becoming something like dry rot, like a sense of eternal hopelessness or helplessness, of sniffing \u201cC\u2019est normal\u201d at everything that sucks because they just can\u2019t be bothered, even when it\u2019s their attitudes that are the biggest obstacle to improving a situation. So for everyone who wants to trot out the same old tropes about the French and self-defeatism, Angeline Benoit reports that there\u2019s a new attitude out there, starting today. Or an old one, for anyone who\u2019s read up on Pierre Beaumarchais and Hortalez & Cie. *** This column doesn\u2019t afford a lot of leisure time, and by \u201ca lot,\u201d we mean \u201cany.\u201d The days are long and days off are claimed by maintenance projects on the Opening Line bureau. The simple joy of reading something that isn\u2019t from a news outlet is rare. When we get that chance, and rereading a Eugene O\u2019Neill play for the umpteenth time doesn\u2019t appeal, there is one guilty pleasure: John D. MacDonald\u2019s "Travis McGee\u2019\u2019 series, about a private eye ("salvage consultant,\u2019\u2019 technically) who lives on a houseboat he won in a poker game and who drives a 1936 Rolls Royce converted into a pickup truck. So it was, in \u201cA Deadly Shade of Gold\u201d (each book in the series has some name of a color in its title), which we\u2019re about halfway through, that we found his client/love interest, Nora Gardino, was driving a \u201clittle black Sunbeam.\u201d A what? A what. After looking it up, the ignorance was embarrassing. This was some car in its day. According to the Wikipedia page, the Sunbeam Motorcar Co. Ltd. was an early rival to Rolls Royce and Jaguar, holder of land-speed records, the first British-made car to win a Grand Prix ("Another first for England, eh wot?"), etc. The book was published in 1965, and since Nora is a sporty model herself, we arrived at the assumption that she was tooling around the book\u2019s Fort Lauderdale, Florida, setting in a Sunbeam Tiger. Think in terms of a little bit of MG, a dash of Corvair, a taste of Miata. It\u2019s what Maxwell Smart drove. Or maybe she was in a Sunbeam Alpine. Is it possible this is the same Sunbeam that was registered in the U.K. just a couple weeks ago as Sunbeam Motor Co. Ltd.? And would MacDonald, were he alive today, put anyone in his potboilers in one of the electric vehicles this company plans to make? ***', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/bitcoin-refuses-to-die-as-currency-draws-draper-opening-line', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 12, 4, 11, 10, 3, 742000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Refuses to Die as Currency Draws Draper: Opening Line'}, {'articleText': u'  Here are highlights of the top breaking news stories from around the world on Saturday: We now know just how badly billionaire David Einhorn and his Greenlight Capital hedge fund got hurt by the gold slump, among other bad bets.

The realtor, which has one office in Willoughby, a suburb 8.5 kilometers (5.3 miles) north of Sydney\u2019s center, this week became able to accept Bitcoin payments, according to spokeswoman Hayley Johnston. While it hasn\u2019t yet taken deposits in the virtual currency, it expects to soon, she said. The broker is Australia\u2019s first property agency to accept Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, to respond to an influx of foreign investors and expatriates seeking property in the nation\u2019s most populous city, according to its website. Chinese buyers overtook their U.S. counterparts to become the biggest real estate investors in Australia in the year ended June 30, plowing A$5.9 billion ($5.5 billion) into residential and commercial property, according to the nation\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be proactive and innovative, and we do have an influx of international investors and expatriates,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper and easier because it takes out the middle man, takes out the fees and charges\u201d associated with more traditional forms of payment like bank transfers, she said. Forsyth will accept the payments through Melbourne-based Bitcoin exchange CoinJar Pty, Johnston said. CoinJar has handled more than A$30 million in Bitcoin transactions from 20,000 local users since it was founded in May 2013, according to Chief Executive Officer Asher Tan. Some 7 percent of the population of the Willoughby council area, where Forsyth is based, was born in China, according to the 2011 census, more than double the proportion of greater Sydney. About half of Forsyth\u2019s purchasers of new properties are from China, according to the company\u2019s senior sales consultant Jane Li. The exchange calculates payments in real time so Forsyth receives the correct amount in the local currency, according to the property broker\u2019s website. The transactions, subject to a 0.5 percent exchange fee paid by those making the payments, are still subject to Australian taxes, Johnston said. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has since gained traction with merchants around the world. Bitcoins have no central issuing authority and use a public ledger to verify transactions. Forsyth\u2019s offering comes as digital currencies come under scrutiny in markets from China to Russia and the U.S., with some regulators calling for bans or limits on their use. The Chinese central bank barred financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions in December to limit attempts to launder money and evade capital controls. Bitcoin has been hard hit since Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest, halted withdrawals on Feb. 7, sending prices tumbling more than 8 percent.

Colombian security forces are in the advanced stages of preparing an assault on Tiger Hill, the mine in a remote part of the Amazon jungle run by FARC, or the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, said National Police Colonel Jose Gerardo Acevedo. The government action was triggered by a Bloomberg Markets magazine report in September, Acevedo said. The article showed how tungsten mined for the profit of FARC makes its way into the supply lines of the makers of BMWs, Ferraris, Porsches and Volkswagens, computers and BIC pens. Apple Inc. and Samsung Inc. have also bought material from that tainted supply line. The parts are used for iPhones, iPads, iPods and Galaxy mobile devices. The planned raid on Tiger Hill follows a move by the European Union to impose tough laws to prevent companies from buying minerals that fund the conflict in Colombia. Acevedo said the Colombian police already knew that FARC was illegally profiting from tungsten mining. What they didn\u2019t know was that the metal, after being exported, was going to so many multinational companies, he said. The plan to shut down Tiger Hill is part of a government push to close mines that are funding the Marxist guerrilla group\u2019s half-century-old war to seize power in Colombia, said Mining Minister Amylkar Acosta. FARC, which says it wants to take control of the Colombian government, holds sway over vast regions of Colombia\u2019s Amazon and stages fatal attacks on police patrols near the area.

Taiwan Central Bank Cautions Bitcoin Users on Risks Bitcoin isn\u2019t a currency and users in transactions must be aware of its risks, Taiwan\u2019s monetary authority said in a statement posted on its website today. The Taiwan central bank will take measures to protect users and maintain financial stability as needed, the monetary authority said in the statement. Bitcoin is a highly speculative virtual good, which carries investment, currency and hacking risk, according to the central bank.

South Dakota Address Helps Richest Shelter Wealth Forever Among the nation\u2019s billionaires, one of the most sought-after pieces of real estate right now is a quiet storefront or similar rentable property in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in order to avail oneself of a type of tax vehicle known as a dynasty trust. In the past four years, the amount of money administered by South Dakota trust companies like some of those operating for wealthy families in Sioux Falls has tripled to $121 billion, almost all of it from out of state. Little more than renting an address in Sioux Falls is required to take advantage of South Dakota\u2019s tax-friendly trust laws. In 1993, South Dakota repealed an old legal rule dating back to 1681 that limited the duration of trusts to the lifetime of a living heir, plus 21 years. Dynasty trusts have no such limits. South Dakota\u2019s sudden popularity illustrates how, at a time of rising U.S. economic inequality, the wealthiest Americans are embracing ever more creative ways to reduce taxes legally through the use of dynasty trusts. Executives at South Dakota Trust Co., one of the biggest in the state, estimate that one-quarter of their business comes from dynasty trusts, which are designed to avoid the federal estate tax. Creation of such trusts has surged in recent years as changes in federal law enabled more money to be placed in them. The dynasty trust isn\u2019t South Dakota\u2019s only lure. Another attraction, for customers in places like New York and Massachusetts, is the chance to shelter their investments from income taxes in their home states. Still others are drawn to South Dakota\u2019s secrecy and protections of trust assets from creditors and former spouses. Many of these features emulate those available in Bermuda and other island havens. Some wealthy families are also attracted by South Dakota rules that enhance their control over investment decisions and make it easier for them to set up their own trust companies rather than rely on a bank trustee. President Barack Obama has called for closing the dynasty trust loophole in annual budget proposals, even though the change wouldn\u2019t boost tax receipts under his administration. The impact of dynasty trusts on federal revenue is far in the future -- though potentially enormous, said Lawrence Waggoner, a retired professor at University of Michigan Law School.

Turkey Bank Stocks Approach Book Value Amid Corruption Probe Turkish bank shares fell to the lowest level in almost five years relative to book value amid a corruption probe that has claimed a lender\u2019s top executive and 10 government ministers. Lenders in Turkey\u2019s 16-company XBANK Index declined to 1.03 times book value in Istanbul trading, the lowest since early 2009, and may fall below book by the end of the year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The index has plunged 17 percent since Dec. 16 to the lowest since June 2012. The corruption investigation, which came to light on Dec. 17, has implicated a banking official as well as government ministers. Halkbank\u2019s chief executive officer, Suleyman Aslan, remains in prison after $4.5 million in cash was found in his house during a police raid, according to news reports. Aslan said the funds were donations he\u2019d gathered to help build Islamic schools, Hurriyet newspaper reported, citing his court testimony. Separately, foreigners are dumping Turkish bonds at the fastest pace in two years, deepening a selloff that\u2019s putting a blot on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s image as the architect of the country\u2019s economic turnaround. The corruption probe, which has ensnared his cabinet and led to three ministerial resignations, is damaging his reputation and adding to a three-month rout in the lira that was triggered in part by the country\u2019s widening current-account deficit. Separately, European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule voiced \u201cgrowing concern\u201d about events in Turkey, according to an e-mailed statement from Brussels. He welcomed the Dec. 27 administrative court decision to suspend the regulation requiring police and prosecutors to provide advance information about investigations.

If we all lived our lives that way, it turns out the world\u2019s a pretty good place.\u201d Guests included Robert Nardelli, the CEO and founder of Xlr-8 LLC and former chief of Chrysler and Home Depot, and Ruurd Kranenberg, the North America CEO of Rabobank International. The event raised $675,000, said Kristin Aguilera, the museum\u2019s deputy director. The museum\u2019s current special exhibit is \u201cThe Fed at 100,\u201d on view through Oct. 1. Matisyahu played songs from his upcoming pop-reggae album last night for an audience that included Morgan Stanley managing director David Bieber and Goldentree Asset Management\u2019s Jon Greenbaum. They were the honorees of the the American Friends of Sheba Medical Center -- Tel Hashomer gala. Israel\u2019s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, founded the medical center in 1948 to rehabilitate wounded soldiers. It has expanded to include heart, cancer and pediatric care and clinical research. The event at Chelsea Piers raised more than $1.2 million to help build bomb-resistant emergency operating rooms, said Helene Feldman, the chairman of the organization\u2019s board and wife of HFZ Capital Group founder Ziel Feldman. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing idea that healing can take place amidst explosions, that there would be recovery happening through that,\u201d Matisyahu said. \u201cThat is what the Jewish people are all about.\u201d The hospital is equipped for war and peace. An underground parking garage under the maternity ward can instantly be transformed to care for patients. Matisyahu wasn\u2019t the only singer at the event: Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary was in attendance. Bieber said when he first learned about the hospital, he asked its director-general, Zeev Rotstein, \u201cWhy commit to a hospital 5,000 miles away?\u201d The hospital\u2019s research endeavors were part of Rotstein\u2019s answer. So was its policy of employing and treating people of all races and religions. \u201cSheba is fighting for peace by bringing many people together,\u201d Bieber said.

Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto as an alternative means of exchange to government-backed currencies. There are 12.1 million Bitcoins in circulation, and supply is governed by rules embedded in the software. The total of the Bitcoins at current prices is about $10.5 billion.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas Frazier in Fort Myers, Florida, today rejected the government\u2019s argument that Faiella, 52, posed a risk of flight and a danger to the community, ordering him released on $250,000 bond. Prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara on Jan. 27 charged Faiella and Charlie Shrem, former vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, with conspiring to launder more than $1 million in the virtual currency. Shrem was released by a federal magistrate later that day on $1 million bond. Faiella and Shrem, 24, are accused of engaging in a scheme to sell Bitcoins to Silk Road users, allowing customers to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously and beyond the reach of law enforcement authorities. The two men, working together, exchanged $1 million in cash for Bitcoins for the benefit of Silk Road users, Bharara said. Faiella, to meet the magistrate\u2019s conditions, agreed to forfeit property in Plaistow, New Hampshire, if he fails to appear in court. He was ordered to surrender his travel documents and to remain under home confinement in the custody of his wife, Suzanne. Frazier also directed that the case be moved to New York where Faiella and Shrem, the chief executive officer and co-founder of BitInstant LLC, face felony charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Central bank officials have discussed establishing more \u201cformal administrative arrangements\u201d for the Canadian dealer offered rate, or CDOR, and are reviewing the merits of changes in benchmarks for overnight index swaps and the Canadian dollar, Lane said. The government\u2019s last budget signaled new legislation will allow for a body to set regulations on how banks submit bids that help generate benchmark lending and currency rates, he said. \u201cWhether it is a litre of wine, a pound of butter or an interest rate benchmark, there should be no question that measurements for commercial and financial transactions are accurate and fair,\u201d Lane said in a speech to the Osgoode Hall Law School and York University\u2019s Schulich School of Business. \u201cBetter articulated governance arrangements for CDOR and other important financial benchmarks will contribute to greater financial stability.\u201d Canadian policy makers have joined global counterparts in stepping up regulation of financial benchmarks amid growing concerns that some reference rates, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, had been manipulated. There has been no evidence of manipulation in the CDOR rate that backs C$130 billion ($116 billion) of floating-rate debt and payments on $9.3 trillion of Canada-dollar interest rate swaps, he said. Some elements of the CDOR rate make it more robust than Libor, Lane said, reiterating there have been no similar problems reported with the Canadian benchmark. Still, regulators are taking steps to strengthen oversight, a process the Bank of Canada is contributing to, Lane said. \u201cWork continues to strengthen other aspects of the governance of CDOR,\u201d said Lane. \u201cWe have discussed with industry the need for it to establish more formal administrative arrangements.\u201d The Bank of Canada has also begun to look at possible changes to the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average, or CORRA, and to the daily indicative foreign exchange rates that it publishes in Ottawa. \u201cWhile there is no evidence of market manipulation affecting the Bank of Canada\u2019s rates, we are reviewing these rates and considering any changes that may be appropriate,\u201d Lane said. \u201cWe will examine how these posted rates are currently used by market participants to see how any possible changes could affect market functioning.\u201d Worldwide, policy makers need to rebuild trust both by replacing some benchmarks with market-based measures and by overhauling others, Lane said. \u201cYou probably have to do some combination of the two to have a set of financial benchmarks that are really trustworthy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are actually near the completion of the big pieces of the reform agenda in response to\u201d the global financial crisis, Lane said in response to a question after the speech. Lane didn\u2019t mention the outlook for the central bank\u2019s 1 percent policy interest rate in the speech, reiterating in response to a student\u2019s question that policy makers focus on bringing inflation to the bank\u2019s 2 percent target. \u201cRecently of course, the Canadian economy has had still a situation of significant excess supply and we expect that it will take somewhere around a couple of years to get back to the inflation target and to get the economy back to its potential,\u201d he said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued four\npeople with ties to brokerage Direct Access Partners LLC over\nclaims they paid millions of dollars in bribes to a Venezuelan\nfinance official to secure the bond-trading business of a state-owned bank.  A DAP unit generated more than $66 million for the New York\nbrokerage from 2009 through at least June 2010 in transaction\nfees on riskless principal trades in Venezuelan sovereign or\nstate-sponsored bonds for Banco de Desarrollo Economico y Social\nde Venezuela, the SEC said in a complaint filed yesterday in\nManhattan federal court. A portion of that revenue was paid to\nthe Venezuelan official, the SEC said.  Tomas Alberto Clarke Bethancourt, an executive vice\npresident at DAP, was responsible for executing the fraudulent\ntrades, according to the SEC. Jose Alejandro Hurtado also\nparticipated, the SEC said.  The SEC also sued Iuri Rodolfo Bethancourt over his role in\nfunneling bribes to the Venezuelan official, who wasn\u2019t sued by\nthe SEC, and Haydee Leticia Pabon, who received about $8 million\nin sham finders\u2019 fees, according to the complaint.  Phone calls to Henry Bell, an attorney for Clarke, and\nFrank Rubino, a lawyer representing Hurtado, weren\u2019t immediately\nreturned. Bethancourt and Pabon have no known defense counsel,\nthe SEC said.  A press official for the bank, who declined to be\nidentified because of company policy, declined to comment. An e-mail sent to the bank today wasn\u2019t immediately returned.  An official in Venezuela\u2019s finance ministry, who declined\nto be identified because of ministry policy, also declined to\ncomment.  U.S. prosecutors filed parallel criminal charges yesterday\nagainst Clarke, Hurtado and the Venezuelan official.  Apple Inc., already facing a U.S. privacy lawsuit over its\ninformation-sharing practices, was told by a German court to\nchange its rules for handling customer data.  A Berlin court struck down eight of 15 provisions in\nApple\u2019s general data-use terms because they deviate too much\nfrom German laws, a consumer group said in a statement on its\nwebsite yesterday. The court said Apple can\u2019t ask for \u201cglobal\nconsent\u201d to use customer data or use information on the\nlocations of customers.  Technology companies face increased pressure from\nregulators over data protection and consumer rights. Google Inc.\nagreed last year to pay $22.5 million to settle U.S. Federal\nTrade Commission allegations it violated people\u2019s privacy rights\nby breaching Apple\u2019s Safari Internet browser.  The German press office of Cupertino, California-based\nApple declined to comment. The ruling, which only applies to\nGermany, can be appealed.  Apple had already signed a binding declaration that it\nwouldn\u2019t use seven of the 15 clauses that consumer group VZBV\nhad objected to before the German suit was filed, the group\nsaid. The remaining eight provisions were invalidated by\nyesterday\u2019s ruling, VZBV said. German law allows recognized\nconsumer groups to sue companies over illegal terms and\nconditions.  A debt-settlement company was accused by the U.S. of\ndefrauding more than 1,200 people struggling with credit-card\ndebt, in the first criminal referral from the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara\u2019s office yesterday\nannounced the unsealing of an indictment against Mission\nSettlement Agency, its manager, Michael Levitis, and three\nemployees. Prosecutors said the defendants \u201csystematically\nexploited and defrauded\u201d people across the country.  The case against Mission is the first criminal referral\nfrom the CFPB, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. Mission\nand its employees lied about its fees, taking thousands of\ndollars from funds that its customers had set aside because they\nbelieved the money would be used to pay creditors, according to\nthe indictment. For the majority of customers, Mission did\nlittle or no work and failed to reduce debt, prosecutors said.  Levitis spent money from Mission on the expenses of a\nnightclub he controlled, lease payments for two Mercedes-Benz\ncars and credit-card bills for his mother, according to the\nindictment.  Jeffrey Lichtman, a lawyer for Levitis, denied the\nallegations and said his client would fight the charges. Levitis\nand three other defendants entered not-guilty pleas through\ntheir lawyers. A U.S. magistrate ordered them released on bail.  The case is U.S. v. Mission Settlement Agency, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Ulbricht, curly-haired, clean-shaven and wearing a red jail jumpsuit with his hands and legs shackled, made his second appearance in federal court in San Francisco this week after being arrested by the FBI Oct. 1 at a city public library. \u201cWe deny all charges and that\u2019s the end of the discussion,\u201d defense attorney Brandon LeBlanc told reporters outside the courtroom today after U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero agreed to give him until next week to compile more financial information for a bail proposal. Prosecutors say Ulbricht ran the \u201cSilk Road Hidden Website\u201d and was known as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d or \u201cDPR,\u201d after a character in the 1987 film \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d Federal agents seized Silk Road, along with digital currency Bitcoins worth $3.6 million, and shut down the site Oct. 2. Prosecutors said in court filings in Manhattan that the site generated more than a billion dollars in illicit sales and took in $80 million in commissions in less than three years. The prosecutors called the site \u201cthe most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet,\u201d and charged Ulbricht with narcotics-trafficking conspiracy, computer-hacking conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy. Ulbricht was also indicted in federal court in Maryland for allegedly trying to arrange the murder of an employee he feared would become a witness against him. The narcotics charge carries a potential maximum sentence of life in prison and a $1 million fine. Ulbricht, who graduated with a physics degree from University of Texas in 2006, told Spero at an Oct. 2 hearing that he couldn\u2019t afford an attorney; a federal public defender appeared with him at the hearing that day. Assistant U.S. Attorney Randall Luskey urged Spero today not to delay the bail hearing and said that the government opposes releasing Ulbricht under any conditions. He said prosecutors in Manhattan are \u201ceager to have this resolved.\u201d \u201cNo combination of surety will assure community safety or guarantee appearance,\u201d Luskey said. While Ulbricht didn\u2019t speak in court today, LeBlanc said, \u201cWe are trying to put together the best bail proposal possible.\u201d After questioning how a bail request fits with a murder-for-hire charge, Spero rescheduled the hearing for Oct. 9, at which time he may also determine whether prosecutors have properly identified the suspect. At least a half dozen federal agents surrounded Ulbricht Oct. 1 near the science fiction shelf at a San Francisco Public Library branch, said Michelle Jeffers, a library spokeswoman. He didn\u2019t appear to resist the agents, who led him away moments later, Jeffers said. The criminal case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 13-mg-023287; the civil forfeiture case is U.S. v.

Karpeles, who lives in Japan, has never been to the U.S. and wasn\u2019t properly served with the complaint that started the suit, Macey said after today\u2019s proceeding. Feinerman gave the lawyer until April 28 to file papers making his arguments. Once the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo on Feb. 28, after announcing it couldn\u2019t account for more than 700,000 customer bitcoins plus 100,000 of its own and halted client withdrawals. The company has since said it located about 200,000 of the missing coins and that the balance, valued at more than $268 million at today\u2019s price, may have been stolen. Each unit of the virtual currency is worth $446.83 today, according to the value-tracking website CoinDesk. \u201cWe think there\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d Jay Edelson, the depositors\u2019 attorney, told Feinerman today. Depositors Gregory Greene of Illinois, who claims he lost access to about $25,000 worth of currency, and Joseph Lack, who allegedly lost about $40,000, have accused Shibuya-ku, Japan-based Mt. Gox, its U.S. affiliate, Karpeles and Tibanne of fraud. Mt. Gox filed papers on March 9 at the U.S. bankruptcy court in Dallas seeking American court recognition of its status in Japan and temporarily preventing its pursuit by creditors in the U.S.. Feinerman last month said he\u2019d block the Chicago plaintiffs from proceeding against the Japanese business, while allowing them to move forward against the U.S. affiliate, Karpeles and other defendants. The judge also issued an order freezing those defendants\u2019 U.S. assets.

Bitcoin exchanges, payment processors and other startups say they need banks to connect them to the existing payments system and provide basic services like checking accounts. To do that, the fledgling companies must convince the regulators who police the banks that Bitcoins aren\u2019t being used to conceal illicit activity. \u201cBanks are scared to deal with Bitcoin companies, even if they really want to,\u201d said Stephen Pair, co-founder and chief technical officer of BitPay Inc., an Atlanta-based company that processes payments for merchants in Bitcoin.

Regulators show little sign of losing interest in tracking financial flows, be they in dollars, renminbi or Bitcoin. China\u2019s central bank yesterday barred financial institutions from buying and selling the virtual currency and from pricing products in Bitcoin, sending prices tumbling more than 10 percent, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which synthesizes prices across major global exchanges where Bitcoins can be traded for traditional currency. Its value stood at $1,052.25 at 5 p.m. New York time. Prices jumped last month when a Department of Justice official described the currency as \u201ca legal means of exchange.\u201d Still, another regulator at the same event warned that Bitcoin-related businesses would need to meet current money-laundering standards before banks would agree to work with them. Central banks in the Netherlands and France have also warned that the currency has no government guarantees. Regulators have pressured banks to close some Bitcoin-related accounts. Tradehill Inc., a San Francisco-based exchange, shut down in August after its bank, Internet Archive Federal Credit Union, dumped Bitcoin-related clients for what it called \u201cregulatory issues.\u201d U.S. officials also shut down an account at Wells Fargo & Co. used by Mt.

Introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the most prominent of a group of virtual currencies -- money that exists mainly as a string of code -- that have no central issuing authority. Today, despite its unclear status, Bitcoin can be used to pay for t-shirts, food or an appointment with a Manhattan psychiatrist. Bank reluctance to host accounts for Bitcoin-related transactions is an obstacle for businesses seeking to expand its use. Without access to traditional banks and the ability to freely exchange Bitcoin for other currencies, the virtual currency risks remaining a novelty for niche users. The issue is expected to be a prime topic of discussion at a conference for Bitcoin enthusiasts next week in Las Vegas. Richard Riese, senior vice president of the American Bankers Association, said the ability to bank Bitcoin transactions \u201cis not high on our members\u2019 list\u201d of priorities. By contrast, at a recent ABA conference, bankers  were less concerned about providing bank accounts for marijuana sellers in the states of Colorado and Washington, which have legalized recreational use while it remains a federal crime. Because of regulatory pressure in the U.S., much of the exchange business has moved to Britain, Japan and China, Jered Kenna, founder of Tradehill, the Bitcoin exchange that lost its bank, said in an interview. LightSpeed Venture Partners, based in Menlo Park, California, announced on Nov. 18 that it would invest $5 million in BTC China, now the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange by volume. \u201cThe biggest indicator that the U.S. is losing this battle is that the first major VC to make an investment was in China,\u201d Kenna said. Bitcoin-related businesses say that when they do find banks willing to work with them, they often require them to keep the banking relationship quiet. Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, a San Francisco company that facilitates transactions for Bitcoin users by hosting digital wallets to store the currency, said the banks his firm uses don\u2019t want to be inundated with requests. \u201cOur bank has asked us not to tell -- not because they\u2019re ashamed but because so many Bitcoin businesses are looking for bank accounts,\u201d Ehrsam said. Mary Dent, a former bank general counsel in Silicon Valley, said bankers are reacting to Bitcoin the way most people do to any new payment form. \u201cIf you heard about somebody getting mugged for the first time, you\u2019d think cash is crazy,\u201d said Dent, founder of Palo Alto, California-based consultancy dcIQ. \u201cIf you heard about credit card fraud for the first time, you\u2019d think cards are crazy. Bitcoin is suffering from that.\u201d Richele Messick, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, declined to comment, as did Tyler Daluz of Citigroup Inc. This idea -- that Bitcoin is more of a threat than an opportunity -- has dominated bank thinking about Bitcoin for most of its existence, Dent said. The federal bust of the Silk Road Hidden Website, an online drug and weapon marketplace where users paid in Bitcoin, highlighted the potential for illicit business, while thieves have also purloined Bitcoins online. Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services subpoenaed 22 Bitcoin-related companies this year. In an Oct. 1 interview, he said the \u201cmajor advantage\u201d Bitcoin provides is anonymity, a cloak for illegality. Marco Santori, a lawyer with Nesenoff & Miltenberg LLP in New York, said the bank position is reasonable since U.S. law has \u201cdeputized\u201d them to scrutinize every transaction for possible money laundering. \u201cBanks will want to provide services to administrators or exchanges that show not only great innovation, but also great integrity and transparency,\u201d said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. As a result, Bitcoin companies have ramped up their Washington lobbying, hiring lawyers and former regulators to make their case to government agencies and demonstrate to potential banking partners that they take regulators seriously. Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc trader, hired a chief compliance officer, Martine Niejadlik, who previously worked at EBay Inc and Amazon.com Inc. \u201cShe\u2019s seen this movie before,\u201d Ehrsam said. Circle Internet Financial Inc. won the biggest venture capital investment yet, $9 million, for a Bitcoin startup, from Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners. One of its first moves was to hire John Beccia, former chief regulatory counsel for the Financial Services Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents major financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. and the dominant payment networks, Visa Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. Circle also put Raj Date, former deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a veteran of Capital One Financial Corp., on its board. All the same, the established financial services industry expresses skepticism of prospects for business ventures with Bitcoin entrepreneurs. \u201cFor now I would opine that we are not yet there with digital currencies,\u201d Paul Smocer, who oversees technology policy for the Washington-based Roundtable, said at a Nov. 19 congressional hearing. \u201cThey do provide opportunities -- more accurately, perhaps, suggest areas of opportunity -- but we will need to address the threats to consumers and society.\u201d Kenna, the head of Bitcoin exchange Tradehill, emphasized that \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d the industry would need banks and need to respond to their concerns. \u201cAnd the foreseeable future could be 50 years.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-05/bitcoin-skepticism-by-bankers-from-china-to-u-s-hinders-growth', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 5, 22, 5, 25, 802000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bankers Balking at Bitcoin in U.S. as Real-World Obstacles Mount'}, {'articleText': u'  Creditors of bankrupt Bitcoin exchange Mt.

Karpeles has agreed only to be questioned in Taipei in April, with a video link for people unable to travel to the Taiwanese city. Because of Karpeles\u2019s \u201cpeculiar knowledge of its coding and operations, it is imperative for the protection of domestic creditors that he be deposed in the United States,\u201d Greene and Lack said in papers filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas. The Tokyo-based exchange entered bankruptcy in Japan last month after losing Bitcoins valued at about $473 million at the time. The company said in its petition for U.S. court protection that almost 750,000 customer Bitcoins and 100,000 of its own, about 7 percent of all Bitcoins in existence worldwide, were missing and probably stolen. The company later said it found 200,000 of the missing Bitcoins in an old-format digital wallet. Questioning Karpeles would allow attorneys for the creditors to prepare for a hearing on whether Mt. Gox\u2019s U.S. assets will continue to be shielded while the company reorganizes in Japan. Greene and Lack accused Mt. Gox and Karpeles of fraud in a lawsuit they filed in federal court in Chicago. Mt. Gox, which started as a marketplace for illustrated trading cards used to play the game \u201cMagic: The Gathering,\u201d is under investigation by prosecutors and regulators examining the use of the digital currency. Greene and Lack asked the judge overseeing the bankruptcy case, Stacey G. Jernigan, to allow their complaint to go forward.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner told U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest today that the government had amassed \u201cvoluminous\u201d amounts of evidence against Ulbricht, including a number of computer servers. Ulbricht, 29, was indicted by a federal grand jury in New York Feb. 4 on four counts -- operating a narcotics trafficking scheme, money laundering conspiracy, computer hacking and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. Charlie Shrem, a prominent evangelist for the currency whom prosecutors called a \u201cBitcoin millionaire,\u201d was charged last month with conspiring to launder more than $1 million in the virtual currency in a case linked to Silk Road. Silk Road was a \u201csprawling black-market bazaar\u201d used by drug dealers and other vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and launder hundreds of millions of dollars derived from the illicit transactions, the U.S. said. Ulbricht designed Silk Road to include a Bitcoin-based payment system to conceal the identities and locations of the users, according to the indictment. Turner today said the government planned to turn over its evidence as well as provide Ulbricht and his lawyers a computer in the next few months so they can review the material. Ulbricht, accused of running Silk Road under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, is being held without bail at the federal jail in Brooklyn, New York, after a federal magistrate ruled that he had commissioned at least six murders-for-hire in an effort to protect his business. He was arrested in October and charged with running \u201cevery aspect\u201d of Silk Road, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. Shrem, 24, is the former vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an industry representative to regulators formed to oversee the currency\u2019s software protocol. He was also chief executive officer of BitInstant, a Bitcoin exchange company. The charge of operating a continuing criminal enterprise carries a maximum life sentence in prison and a mandatory minimum term of 20 years. Narcotics conspiracy also carries a maximum life term while the money laundering conspiracy carries a term of as long as 20 years. The criminal case is U.S. v.

Cornelis Jan Slomp of Woerden, the Netherlands, facing a single drug trafficking conspiracy count, agreed to plead guilty, according to a statement issued today by U.S. Attorney Zachary T. Fardon in Chicago and Slomp\u2019s lawyer. He was arrested in Miami last year when a criminal complaint was filed against him. Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of more than $3 million in alleged proceeds of his crimes. Slomp sold the drugs through the now-shuttered Silk Road website, described by the Justice Department as a \u201csprawling black-market bazaar\u201d for drug-dealing and money laundering. Ross William Ulbricht, who allegedly ran the site under the name \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d pleaded not guilty in February to operating a narcotics-trafficking scheme, conspiring to launder money and other crimes. \u201cIn the global black market for all things illegal, Slomp allegedly was a prolific vendor on Silk Road,\u201d Gary Hartwig, the Homeland Security special agent in charge of investigations in Chicago, said in a statement issued jointly with Fardon. Slomp was captured at the Miami International Airport on route to a meeting with co-conspirators where he planned to \u201cspin off his entire U.S. Silk Road operations\u201d to one of them, prosecutors said. He is in custody facing a mandatory minimum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum term of as long as 40 years. His attorney, Paul Petruzzi of Miami, confirmed his client\u2019s intent to plead guilty today in a phone interview. No court date has been set for the plea, he said. \u201cIt was a decision that he made early on, something that we\u2019ve all been working on as a team since his arrest,\u201d the attorney said. A plea agreement with prosecutors will be filed, he said. Slomp is alleged to have had 11 European co-conspirators who aided in the manufacturing, packing and shipping of illegal drugs including ecstasy tablets bearing a question mark, which prosecutors said was Slomp\u2019s identifying logo. Slomp received about 385,000 bitcoins from more than 10,000 transactions, according to the U.S. The virtual currency was trading today at $487.71 per unit, according to the tracking website CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. His Silk Road operations ran from March 2012 to August 2013 and were monitored by undercover federal agents, the government said.

By now it could be worth significantly more or less. But as Bitcoin mania drives the price upward, a chorus of skeptics predict\u2014or openly pine for\u2014the moment when everything comes crashing down. I recently mentioned Bitcoin in the office of a venture capitalist, and for a second it seemed like he was going to punch me in the face. In a column in the New York Times last week, Adrian Chen laid out the basic anti-Bitcoin argument, complete with the sense of personal affront: \u201cAll I can say is that the crash is going to be great,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBitcoin is too dependent on speculative mania to be of practical use as a currency.\u201d Still, he couldn\u2019t help expressing regret that he didn\u2019t buy some of the currency when he first wrote about it in 2011, at a time when it was worth $9. Chen\u2019s initial discovery was about Silk Road, an online black market based on Bitcoin, and his initial article for Gawker sent the value of the currency spiking by drawing attention to something new and dangerous. The ability for buzz to have this kind of impact remains Bitcoin\u2019s basic problem. While its proponents see it as a new form of economic exchange, the Bitcoin economy is still small and illiquid enough to be sent reeling by any piece of news. When Silk Road was busted up in October, the value plummeted\u2014for a few hours. Commentators rushed to proclaim the end of the whole experiment, and then the price shot back up and has kept going ever since. This makes it a compelling vehicle for speculation, and the stories about the Bitcoin millionaires are legion. But for the true believers who think the currency will be a huge boon for e-commerce and remittances and will generally save us all, this volatility is arguably the biggest threat there is. If a currency can\u2019t even stay the same value through the duration of a transaction, it can\u2019t very well serve as the basis for a revolutionary new online economy. So how does Bitcoin stabilize? Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, says it\u2019s just a matter of getting more people to use it. The larger the economy grows, he suggests, the less volatile it will be. Then every incremental development doesn\u2019t have to be a coup or a crisis. A major thing standing in the way of its adoption as a mundane vehicle for economic exchange? Volatility. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d acknowledges Brito. According to Brito, the increase in the value of Bitcoin does seem like a bubble, but it\u2019s also a vote of confidence in its incredible potential. China loves it. Washington loves it. The drug dealers are out (for now). This thing is going to be huge! That\u2019s the optimist\u2019s view. The other possibility is the price will go up until the price doesn\u2019t go up anymore. And the 17th century Dutch saw how that turned out with tulips. It could be that the speculators outnumber the believers, and interest mainly reflects a lack of other good investment opportunities. In that scenario, people will begin pulling out at the first hint the party is over, the bubble will pop, and everyone else will go back to buying Subway sandwiches, haircuts, and spaceflights with boring old dollars (or yuan or whatever). In fact, don\u2019t look now but Bitcoin\u2019s value in dollars is lower than it was last week! Of course, spotting the bubble seems to be a national pastime of late. If you want to have the exact same argument with slightly different vocabulary, start a discussion about the Dow Jones industrial average or the valuation of tech startups. Bitcoin is either filling a need for a new kind of Internet currency or serving as a neat new way to place an exotic bet.

The currency sparked a frenzy last summer when media attention drove the price of Bitcoins to $30 each, but enthusiasm has since waned. Extreme price volatility and limited usability will do that to a young currency. In another blow to widespread adoption, TradeHill, an American exchange where Bitcoins can be bought, sold, and converted into other currencies, announced it was suspending trading. In a post on the company blog, TradeHill Chief Executive Officer Jered Kenna cited \u201cincreasing regulation\u201d and a lack of funds. \u201cTradeHill can not operate in it\u2019s [sic] current capacity without proper money transmission licensing \u2026 [W]e have deemed the best course of action is to halt trading and pursue licensing while raising funds,\u201d he wrote. He also stated that all assets in TradeHill accounts would be returned to clients. Although TradeHill\u2019s troubles could be mostly due to simple cash flow issues, Ars Technica reports U.S. regulatory authorities haven\u2019t quite figured out what to do with Bitcoin. As a Treasury spokesman told Bank Technology News last month: \u201cThe anonymous transfer of significant wealth is obviously a money-laundering risk \u2026 At some level we are aware of Bitcoin and other similar operations, and we are studying the mechanism behind Bitcoin.\u201d The spokesman didn\u2019t specify how the government would apply money-laundering laws to Bitcoin. If businesses dealing with the exchanges can\u2019t be sure they won\u2019t be investigated for money laundering, they have even less of an incentive to take a chance on outfits like TradeHill. The closure has hit the wider community hard; the currency\u2019s value has dropped about 25 percent since the announcement, raising even more questions about its viability as an investment vehicle or unit of exchange.

One of the biggest dangers, according to the SEC, is simply that investors check their common sense at the door when fraudsters come pitching something sexy and apparently innovative. \u201cA new product, technology, or innovation\u2014such as Bitcoin\u2014has the potential to give rise to both frauds and high-risk investment opportunities,\u201d the notice starts. \u201cPotential investors can be easily enticed with the promise of high returns in a new investment space and also may be less skeptical when assessing something novel, new and cutting-edge.\u201d For those who can\u2019t resist the lure of such virtual-currency investments\u2014even after recent cautionary tales, such as the Mt. Gox blowup\u2014the SEC has some practical advice, nearly all of which would seem to apply equally to any investment. Avoid schemes that \u201cguarantee\u201d high investment returns, come from individuals or investment firms that are not licensed or registered with securities regulators, and arrive unsolicited from unknown senders. But another thing applies more particularly to Bitcoin\u2019s true believers: If you were an early adopter of Bitcoin, the SEC suspects you will make a particularly enticing target. \u201cScam artists take advantage of Bitcoin users\u2019 vested interest in the success of Bitcoin to lure these users into Bitcoin-related investment schemes,\u201d the notice warns. \u201cFraudsters and promoters may solicit investors through forums and online sites frequented by members of the Bitcoin community.\u201d Finally, the nature of Bitcoin makes recourse difficult, in the event you\u2019re taken in by a scam. Law enforcement faces challenges in investigations involving Bitcoin, since the nature of the currency makes it hard to trace or seize or freeze ill-gotten gains. The SEC last July published an investor alert (pdf) about Ponzi schemes using virtual currencies. But the danger to investors seems to be rising in regulators\u2019 minds as Bitcoin\u2019s popularity increases and legitimate, but high-risk investment opportunities expand along with fraud.

One reason: Americans waste an average of 28 minutes each month just getting to their cash, with part-timers, retirees, and African Americans likely to spend even more time accessing their money. The worst hit, not surprisingly, are low-income consumers, who are dinged with higher fees, along with the lost time. The U.S. study released this week is the first in a series that will examine the cost of cash worldwide; studies of India, Egypt, and Mexico will follow. Each study looks at the impact on consumers, businesses, and government in economies that show different payment patterns. Bhaskar Chakravorti, who\u2019s spearheading the research as senior associate dean at Tufts\u2019 Fletcher School, said the effort is aimed at quantifying what people intuitively understand: Cash is an inefficient way to store value and conduct transactions. What\u2019s surprising, says Chakravorti, is just how inefficient. \u201cWhen you factor in the fees, the time, the lost taxes, and other costs, using cash is a significant drain,\u201d he says. With all the buzz about Bitcoin, PayPal, Google Wallet, and all the other innovations in digital currencies, it\u2019s easy to forget that cash remains remarkably resilient. In part, that\u2019s because the cost of using it is often hidden to the users themselves. Chakravorti, along with co-author Benjamin Mazzotta, says that\u2019s especially true for those who don\u2019t even have a bank account. The unbanked are four times more likely to pay fees to get their own money, yet are also more likely to trust cash and feel comfortable carrying around large amounts. For businesses, the biggest cost of cash comes from theft. Even if they can afford armored cars and guards to prevent outsiders from taking their cash, there\u2019s still the risk that insiders will drain the coffers. Government, meanwhile, pays a price in lost tax revenue and the cost of actually making currency. (Canada, for one, decided earlier this year to stop making the penny.) So what\u2019s the solution? Financial education and inclusion is part of one; balanced regulation to protect consumers, while encouraging innovation, is another. Still, consumers aren\u2019t completely misguided in preferring cash over other forms of payment. For some, the costs of higher fees and wasted time pales next to the burden of credit-card debt or ID theft. Until they get forms of payment that feel as easy and risk-free as the money in their pockets, many will decide that the costs of cash are just fine.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/dianebrady', 'name': u'Diane Brady', 'twitterhandle': u'dianebrady'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-10/why-cash-costs-the-u-dot-s-dot-economy-real-money', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 9, 10, 21, 31, 46, 512000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Why Cash Costs the U.S. Economy Real Money'}, {'articleText': u' Researchers from Cornell University caused a stir among Bitcoin enthusiasts this week with a report detailing what they said was a technical vulnerability that would allow people to corner the supply of the virtual currency, undermining the entire system. News about Bitcoin has had a tendency to bounce around in value a lot, depending on new developments, but the revelation of a potentially fatal flaw hasn\u2019t much registered on its market, which has been on quite the upward swing. Like everything with Bitcoin, the specifics of the Cornell report are complicated. But it basically works like this: The Bitcoin system is based on getting its users to guarantee that coins aren\u2019t spent twice. This requires a good deal of computational power, so the system rewards users who verify blocks of transactions by awarding new Bitcoins to those doing the computing. The process is known as mining. Just like miners looking for gold, the Bitcoin type doesn\u2019t know exactly where the rewards will be. Every once in a while, Bitcoin miners involved in verifying blocks of transactions will unlock a reward, announce it, and everyone moves to the next block. The supposed vulnerability comes when miners don\u2019t tell everyone else when they\u2019ve completed work on one block.\xa0So-called selfish miners, warn researchers\xa0Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer, could keep their success a secret and then move on the next block, gaining a head start on everyone else. If a large enough network of computers get in on such a plan, they could stay just far enough ahead of the crowd, continuing to claim the rewards for themselves. This isn\u2019t the first time that this type of scheme has been discussed as a possible threat to Bitcoin. Nor is there any evidence that people have actually tried to carry it out. Skeptics immediately said that existing methods to prevent this type of attack are already in place. Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group, wrote a response essentially dismissing the research while giving its authors an A for Effort. \u201cLet me start out with how fantastic it is that we\u2019re seeing more academic interest and research in Bitcoin-the-system,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cIn the coming months, I expect we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more research claiming to have found ways to [make] various pieces of Bitcoin better. Some of it will even turn out to be right.\u201d But not this research, which Andresen said was based on \u201coversimplified assumptions about how the bitcoin mining market works.\u201d Keep poking and prodding at Bitcoin, he tells researchers, but let\u2019s not get all up in a tizzy the second each new paper comes out. \u201cPeer review works best when everybody involved is given time [for] conversation and debate without being contacted by [reporters] on deadline,\u201d he wrote. The specifics of this particular attack are muddy, but one thing about the Bitcoin market is clear: Demand for insight exceeds supply.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-07/a-possibly-useless-guide-to-pillaging-the-bitcoin-mine', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 7, 20, 51, 36, 523000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'A Possibly Useless Guide to Pillaging the Bitcoin Mine'}, {'articleText': u' Something funny happened this week when I read the news about Blockbuster shutting down all of its stores. For a split second, I thought: \u201cWow, this means I can buy lots of DVDs at discount prices.\u201d Then I remembered that I don\u2019t own a DVD player anymore. OK, that\u2019s not entirely true. I do still have one, but it\u2019s tucked away in the basement and hasn\u2019t been used in years. Instead, I stream everything. Netflix, Hulu, and the occasional video-on-demand rental from services such as Vudu or Google Play have kept me busy enough to also make me forget about those few hundred DVDs I still own. And if I ever really want to watch something from a disc, I can always use my MacBook. But honestly, I don\u2019t remember the last time I did that. I know what you\u2019re thinking. How does one guy\u2019s habits make a trend? It\u2019s true: My setup and my television- and movie-viewing habits may not be representative of mainstream America, but a closer look at the numbers shows I may not be that far ahead of everyone else: First, there\u2019s Blockbuster. The chain had 9,000 stores at its peak, with a total revenue of $5.9 billion in 2004. This week, Dish Network said it was closing Blockbuster\u2019s remaining 300 stores. In the second quarter of 2013, Blockbuster\u2019s revenue fell to $120 million. Sales of physical media peaked a decade ago, with U.S. consumers spending $24.9 billion on DVDs, Blu-ray discs, and VHS tapes in 2004. In 2012 that number was down to $8.46 billion, according to numbers from the Digital Entertainment Group, a trade association that tracks revenue in this space. And hopes that Blu-ray sales and rentals would pick up while DVDs faded largely haven\u2019t materialized. Netflix\u2019s DVD subscriptions also continue to decline, from almost 14 million subscribers in 2011 to just 7.15 million in Q3 of this year. But the end of Blockbuster isn\u2019t just about the decline of physical media. It\u2019s about the end of movies as a product, as consumers quickly adapt to a world of digital access. And that\u2019s a trend that should really scare Hollywood\u2014much more than those going-out-of-business signs that are popping up at remaining Blockbuster stores all over the country. Studio executives would like to believe they can get consumers to purchase and collect movies again if they add some bells and whistles, such as cloud access and exclusive online content. It\u2019s the thinking behind UltraViolet, the more-or-less industrywide cloud storage locker. UltraViolet provides streaming access to digitally purchased movies as well as digital copies of plain old DVDs, and it\u2019s being heavily promoted by both studios and retailers including Wal-Mart Stores, Best Buy, and Target. But two years after the service\u2019s launch, only 15\xa0percent of consumers even know about it. That\u2019s why Hollywood is also pushing to make digital purchases more attractive, even if that means sabotaging other business models. Prices for so-called VOD rentals (movies you can access for 24 to 48 hours) are going up, while digital sales (digital files that are yours to keep) are becoming cheaper. Revenues from digital sales are increasing as a result, reaching $274 million in Q3 of 2013, up from $178\xa0million in Q3 of 2012. The Digital Entertainment Group doesn\u2019t differentiate between movie and TV shows when discussing digital sales, but an industry insider told me that 80 percent to 90 percent of all digital movie revenue comes from rentals, not sales. That\u2019s impressive, until you compare it with the $25 billion consumers spent on physical media 10 years ago. And it becomes even less significant when you consider that TV show episodes are only available as digital sales. I regularly \u201cbuy\u201d episodes of shows like The Walking Dead only to never watch them again, simply because there is no option to rent. And then, of course, there\u2019s online subscriptions, which dwarf the entire sector. Netflix alone clocked $700 million of digital revenue in Q3. Amazon\u2019s contribution is a little harder to calculate, but the company said it added \u201cmillions\u201d of paying Prime subscribers last quarter, thanks in large part to its video service. All of this goes to show that the way in which people consume their movies is rapidly changing. Studios would like consumers to go back to a pre-Blockbuster era, when movies were bought like physical products at a price that came with a healthy profit margin. But Blockbuster\u2019s demise is just one more reminder that physical products are disappearing\u2014and with them, the concept of ownership. Instead, consumers value convenience and access. The idea that you have to buy a movie to watch it may soon be as forgotten as that DVD player in my basement. \nAlso from GigaOM:\n Exploring the Software Defined Data Center of the Future (subscription required) \nRoadmap 2013: To Each Her Own in Product and Design\n \nFirst Bitcoin ATM Gets 348 Transactions in First 8 Days.

Even after becoming the first person ever convicted of a Bitcoin-related crime, Shrem continues to cultivate a following among Bitcoin loyalists, some of whom paint him as a sort of martyr for the digital currency. Since September, Shrem has been answering fans\u2019 questions on Bitcoin.com while serving a two-year prison sentence for money laundering associated with Silk Road, an online black market that allowed people to buy drugs and guns. Holding a Reddit-style \u201cask me anything\u201d session from inside the slammer isn\u2019t easy. For one thing, inmates are barred from accessing the Web, according to Shawn Bartlett, a spokesman for the U.S. federal prison system in Lewisburg, Pa., near where Shrem is being held. While locked up, Shrem found salvation from the isolating environment with help from a proponent of the digital currency known informally as\xa0Bitcoin Jesus. Roger Ver, whose strange nickname comes\xa0from his proselytizing for the digital currency, knew Shrem through the Bitcoin community. Ver himself is an ex-convict who was sentenced to 10 months in a U.S. prison for selling explosives. He\u2019s now the chief executive officer of Bitcoin.com, which hosts links to an exchange for buying Bitcoin, news about the digital currency, and discussion groups. QuickTake The Rise of Bitcoin The two Bitcoin entrepreneurs began communicating regularly through the prison e-mail system. Ver said he proposed hosting a Q&A with Shrem on his website\u2019s message boards. Shrem was into the idea, but because he doesn\u2019t have direct Web access, Ver relays the questions through the prison\u2019s e-mail network and posts the responses on Shrem\u2019s behalf. \u201cThe outside world still loves and supports Charlie, and there are many people around the world who want to know how he is doing,\u201d Ver said. Shrem\u2019s fans send good wishes and invitations to attend conferences when he\u2019s released. The questions often center around what life is like on the inside. Shrem\u2019s activity on the forum has been sporadic. Inmates don\u2019t have unlimited computer access, and their e-mails are screened. He recalled getting really sick when he first got behind bars but has gotten into a routine. He said he\u2019s read 70 books, including works on economics, spy thrillers, and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, which is set in a 1950s Soviet labor camp. Shrem teaches inmates who are trying to earn a high-school diploma. He also educates them on the virtues of Bitcoin.\xa0In one post, Shrem\xa0wrote: \u201cAll the inmates know about Bitcoin! I'm even teaching them about Sidechains, Ripple and others so they understand what the industry look like. Many people here even owned Bitcoin before they came in. We have a lot of programmers here, finance guys, doctors, and economists. Just the other day, someone asked me to schedule an hour with him so he can pick my brain. Everyone is very respectful and clean. This is our home for now, and we treat it that way.\u201d Shrem ran a New York Bitcoin exchange called BitInstant and was a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation, where he used to be\xa0vice chairman. Shrem, who\xa0didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment,\xa0started his sentence this spring. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt that I don't know everything,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was a very arrogant person and let my ego get the best of me. I've learnt how to have patience and slow down my thinking.\u201d Once he gets out, Shrem said he doesn\u2019t plan to return to New York. He\u2019s considering a move to Austin, Tex., \u201cand eventually out of the country when possible.\u201d Ver has long since moved to\xa0Japan.

At 2014's halfway mark, ETFs focused on India, coffee and gold miners are the comeback kids. Among the leaders in those sectors are the Market Vectors India Small Cap Index (SCIF), up 61 percent as of June 27, and the iPath Dow Jones-UBS Coffee Total Return Sub-Index ETN (JO), up 53 percent. Last year SCIF was down 29 percent, and JO fell 32 percent. Another top performer is Global X Gold Explorers ETF (GLDX), up 40 percent this year after plummeting 62 percent in 2013. One of the year's most unexpected twists is that the best-performing bond ETF was one holding long-term Treasury bonds, an ETF that is more sensitive to rising interest rates than any other bond ETF. You would have been considered kind of crazy if you had bought it at the start of the year, when conventional wisdom said rates were going to rise. Instead, rates fell and the Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon US Treasury Index ETF (ZROZ) rose 22 percent. Credit for a timely contrarian call goes to Paul Baiocchi, a former analyst for etf.com, who predicted lower rates and, after putting ZROZ in his 2014 picks, was promptly mocked by his colleagues. Vanguard's Flow-GetterAmong ETF issuers, Vanguard Group Inc. had a great first half. The firm took in $31 billion -- 42 percent of the $71 billion industry total. In addition, 64 of its 67 ETFs attracted new money, an average of $460 million per fund. In contrast, BlackRock Inc., the No. 2 in first-half flows with $26 billion, saw its average ETF take in $70 million. Vanguard also had six ETFs in the top 10 list, including the overall No. 1 flow-getter, the $4 billion Vanguard FTSE Developed Market ETF (VEA). It tracks 1,300 international developed stocks for a fee of 0.09 percent of assets annually. Vanguard's rule of the top 10 list was a sign that the short-term money pulled back after last year's run -- buy-and-hold investors tend to buy Vanguard's ETFs. Many of the favorite super-liquid ETFs of quick-buck traders were on the top 10 list of ETFs seeing outflows. That includes SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY), which lost $14 billion; PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which lost $4 billion and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), which lost $2.3 billion. However, money moved into many of these ETFs in June.Related story: BlackRock Retakes Lead in ETF Sales in Second Quarter on Emerging Markets First Trust, which offers smart-beta ETFs popular with retail investors, also had strong inflows. Some $5 billion poured into its ETFs, which makes it the overall No. 3. A popular fund in its stable is the First Trust Europe AlphaDEX Fund (FEP). It uses both growth and value fundamentals to score and weight its portfolio. FEP took in $450 million, about doubling its size to just under $1 billion. Along with First Trust, more than 15 ETF issuers had inflows that represented at least a 20 percent jump in assets.New Momentum PlayThe first half was a fertile time for the ETF industry, and the 1,600 existing ETFs were joined by 99 new ones. That compares with 72 new launches as of last year's midpoint. There were also 23 closures so far in 2014, well below the 42 a year ago. The strategy mix of the ETFs ranged from plain vanilla indexing to fairly complex financial wonkery (such as factor-based smart-beta techniques). The most successful launch in terms of assets is a momentum strategy ETF called the First Trust Dorsey, Wright Focus Five Fund (FV). The $325 million ETF basically invests in the five of its sector momentum ETFs that exhibit the most momentum and relative strength in price. Basically, momentum funds invest in areas going up relative to the market, and try to ride the wave.  What to expect in the second half? We'll see the first-ever credit default swap ETFs. And non-transparent actively managed ETFs look likely to win approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would open the floodgates for giant mutual fund firms to launch more actively managed ETFs. That's because the ETFs wouldn't have to show the world their holdings -- be transparent -- every day, which was a major concern of the firms. Last but not least may be the launch of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, which could add a nice bit of circus sideshow to the second half. Stay tuned. It\u2019s going to get interesting.

In\xa0Facebook\'s settings, people can now appoint a friend or family member to be in charge of their legacy. The person gets to make one last\xa0public post, download all their loved one\'s Facebook photos, and respond to friend requests. The decision was applauded by estate planners\u2014especially because it gets around the issue of needing a password to get into people\'s accounts. Yet it doesn\'t solve all the problems around online information after death. For example, what happens if a user dies, and family members want to see private messages to get clues about whether it\xa0was a suicide? Using their password to get into the account, which is banned by Facebook\'s terms of service, would violate\xa0federal privacy laws, says\xa0James Lamm, a principal at a Minnesota firm in charge of estate planning. Appointing a legacy account handler on Facebook also isn\'t legally binding and doesn\'t transfer any of the intellectual property\xa0on videos or poetry the person may have posted, he said. For attorneys such as\xa0Lamm, who works at the estate planning group of Gray Plant Mooty, the infrastructure of the digital world has created countless barriers for clients seeking to access\xa0bank accounts, find answers surrounding a death, or simply collect all the memories they can about the person they lost. Passwords, terms of service, encryption, and cloud storage all complicate the search for information required after a death.\xa0 "People get their income statements electronically; they get bills electronically; and if the fiduciary for the will doesn\'t have access to that, it may lead to costs and delays, and we may be missing valuable financial assets," Lamm says. "Facebook\'s move is a nice helpful step. I hope other companies follow suit." Some companies have particularly stringent\xa0policies.\xa0Here\'s a\xa0brief guide on\xa0how to prepare your online identity for\xa0the afterlife. Apple\'s\xa0terms of service in the U.S. say that if you die, you can\'t designate anybody else to get into your account. "Any rights to your Apple ID or content within your account terminate upon your death," Apple\'s iCloud terms in the U.S. say. "Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate your account may be terminated and all content within your account deleted." Yahoo\'s wording is similar. The terms mean that after death, cancelling bills, many of which are now auto-paid online or arranged through e-mail, may be more difficult. Some cable or Internet providers that\xa0don\'t have the right passcodes or account information can require mailing\xa0a death certificate and a legal cover letter, says\xa0Woodrow Levin, chief executive officer of Estate Assist. E-mail accounts\xa0may also give clues or avenues to other revenue streams, such as blogs with regular advertising revenue or Bitcoins, which may not otherwise be discovered. "That\'s like saying if my dad passes away, I\'m just going to throw away all his stuff and burn it," Levin says. "It should be up to the people left in charge of the estate." Google was the first large company to create a policy for dealing with the data of deceased users involving their survivors. Like Facebook, Google allows someone to decide whether his or her\xa0profile\xa0should be deleted after death or to create an "inactive account manager." Once that person has died, the account manager can fill out a form to request data or shut it down, among other options.\xa0 "We can work with immediate family members and representatives to close online accounts in some cases once a user is known to be deceased, and in certain circumstances we may provide content from a deceased user\u2019s account," the company says. All the uncertainty has, of course, created opportunity. Levin founded his company and raised money from venture capitalists to create a lockbox of personal data for survivors to review after death. Lamm has seen an\xa0increase\xa0in people who want to add instructions to their wills for how their online accounts should be managed. "What I tell my clients is, make a list of any of your digital property that is financially valuable or sentimental to you, and tell us how do we get that, how do we get in, and where would you like it to go?" Lamm says.

A dental practice was hit last year by a strain of malicious software that sought out X-ray images and encrypted them on the clinic\'s computer system. Hackers in Eastern Europe then demanded $500 in Bitcoins to unlock the files, according to Jeff Horne, who investigated the breach for Accuvant, a Denver-based security firm. The ransom amount increased by $500 each day it wasn\'t paid. While ransomware has been around for years, it has typically taken the form of fake antivirus alerts. Criminals demand payment to clean the malware (their own, of course) from the victims\' computers. Now, hackers are using programs such as CryptoLocker and CryptoWall to search out valuable files on victims\' machines and encrypt them, rendering them useless until a fee is paid. Often times, the most valuable files are images. This type of cyber-extortion comes as more of the health-care industry goes digital with their patient records. Last year, we wrote about medical practices in Illinois and Australia that were infiltrated by hackers who encrypted patients\' files and held them for ransom. Security experts expect to see these kinds of incidents becoming more common. The use of ransom software is growing rapidly. Symantec, the biggest maker of security software, detected five times more of it in 2013 compared with 2012, according to Kevin Haley, a director at the company. The use of crypto-ransom software in particular is growing fast. In 2002, it accounted for 0.2 percent of all ransomware attacks. This year, it\'s 25 percent, he said. Hackers are targeting images because they think those files are the ones people will most likely pay for to retrieve, he said. "Eventually this will become the dominant form of ransomware," Haley said. "With photos, there\'s emotional value. That\'s really effective." The medical industry is already a prime target for hackers. Last week, Community Health Systems, a Tennessee-based hospital chain, disclosed an extensive breach affecting 4.5 million health records.

Though it\'s still hard to imagine that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund will be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, given its multitude of unique risks\n, it\'s made it this far and can\'t be laughed off. That won\'t stop us from trying. Do bitcoins belong in an investor-friendly ETF wrapper? In fairness, my colleague Matt Miller of Bloomberg TV made a good point\n, noting that "You can (already) blow your head off with an ETF anytime you want! You can triple up leverage!" The SEC has approved about 250 leveraged and inverse ETFs that arguably have more volatility and potential for investor misuse worse than a bitcoin ETF. (For more on the topic, see Grandma Gets to Play Hedge Fund with New Credit Derivatives ETFs\n.) If the Winklevoss twins get that far, they\'ll need to pick a ticker. Matt suggests the Winklevoss Treasury Fund, arguing that the ETF "will really just serve to fill their coffers." And that ticker\'s available. My advice for Team Winklevoss: Don\'t pick WNKL or VOSS. Look, they named their bitcoin index WINKDEX. No objection to corny -- corny ETF tickers can be great. There\'s MOO for the Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF, ROOF for the IndexIQ U.S. Real Estate Small Cap ETF and GDAY (and CROC) for the ProShares Ultra (and UltraShort) Australian Dollar ETF. But all these speak to the investment focus of the ETF, not the issuer. Even Bill Gross used BOND for the Pimco Total Return Bond ETF. He probably could have gotten away with calling it BILL. If the twins want to express the spirit of bitcoin in the ticker, BIT, COIN, CRYP or MATH would do. Unfortunately, all are taken, so we\'re going to have to think outside the Voss here. The ticker could hint at bitcoin\'s appeal to libertarians and others distrustful of the U.S. government and banks, with SCAT or GWAY. Or, given all that weird brainpower behind the creation and virtual mining of the digital currency, BRNY would work, at the risk of alienating the Brooklynites who are inevitably cooking up their own ETF. You could also go ironic and call it SILK, for that bitcoin-friendly Amazon of illegal drugs, the online market Silk Road, or GOX, after the exchange that shut down after losing 850,000 bitcoins valued at about $500 million.  And in the brothers\' heart of hearts, there\'s always FUFB.

No one out there is pining for the HealthShares Dermatology and Wound Care ETF. But there is one defunct ETF that investors and analysts long for: the Guggenheim Airlines ETF.  Now earnings season brings news of $1 billion stock buybacks at both American Airlines Group Inc. and at United Continental Holdings Inc., the parent company of United Airlines. American also announced its first dividend\n       payment since 1980.  Even amid a string of crises that include the tragic downing of a civilian airliner by separatists in Ukraine, there has been little lasting impact\n       on major financial markets around the world. And while airline stocks retreated recently,\n       after rising on optimism tied to the repurchase plans and record second-quarter profits, they remain well positioned\n      to profit as the global economy recovers, writes Bloomberg TV\'s Adam Johnson. The Guggenheim ETF, which had FAA as its ticker -- think Federal Aviation Administration -- closed right in the middle of a 151 percent tear in airline stocks over two and half years. Such a rally inevitably got more investors interested in the notoriously cyclical industry. While there\'s no no pure-play ETF anymore, there is another fund with a good slug of airline stocks. It is the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN\n      ), which has a 23 percent allocation to airline stocks. It\'s returned 43 percent since March, 2013. Investors will also get the stocks of companies such as FedEx Corp. (FDX)\n       and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ)\n      .  One note of caution: Every stock XTN holds gets equal weight in the portfolio. With 50 percent of assets in small- and mid-caps, it\'s about twice as volatile as the S&P 500 Index. FAA was liquidated in March 2013, after it failed to attract big inflows. It had been the only airline ETF left; Direxion closed its airline ETF in 2011 after it attracted only $2 million. Since FAA closed, the NYSE Arca Global Airline Index, which it tracked, is up 61 percent. That\'s more than double the 28 percent for the S&P 500. And while the news about airplanes recently has been unremittingly tragic, investors tend to take a hard-nosed financial view of the industry\'s longer-term prospects.  Guggenheim\'s ETF tracked 25 stocks, including United Airlines (UAL\n      ; now United Continental Holdings), Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL\n      ), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV\n      ) and Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK\n      ). It had $21 million in assets when it closed, more money than 500 ETFs have today. If FAA hadn\'t been closed, it would have been able to cross the $50 million mark \u2013 the approximate amount an ETF needs to be profitable nearly on market performance alone.  There are no airline ETFs in registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It\'s hard to imagine there won\'t be another one at some point, though. Murphy\u2019s Law tells us that by the time another one rolls around, the industry will start faltering. It won\'t matter to Warren Buffett, who has shunned the stocks\n       for 25 years, citing their high fixed costs, strong labor unions and commodity pricing. To him they are just plain "terrible businesses."  More stories from Eric Balchunas: Follow @EricBalchunas\n on twitter Eric Balchunas is an exchange-traded-fund analyst at Bloomberg.

More and more nations are taking an official stance on the software since it emerged in 2008 as a virtual currency that\u2019s not controlled by any government or central bank. Bitcoins can be used to pay for everything from hand-made rugs to window cleaning. Students at the University of Nicosia in Cyprus can even pay for their tuition with the software. Paul Ehling, associate professor in the department of financial economics at the BI Norwegian Business School, said the government\u2019s definition of money may be too narrow. \u201cCurrency is any agreed upon means of exchanges of goods and services, so you could have some small stones, as used in history, and if it\u2019s accepted by a sufficiently large population, then that\u2019s enough,\u201d Ehling said in an interview. \u201cThese days we do mean that a much larger group of people is willing to exchange goods or services for this currency.\u201d China, U.S. There are about 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts. Users of the digital money are finding that its wider adoption depends on policy makers and banks as governments from China to the U.S. try to create a set of rules to protect users. Bitcoin exchanges, payment processors and other startups say they need banks to connect them to the existing payments system and provide basic services like checking accounts. To do that, the fledgling companies must convince the regulators that police the banks that Bitcoins aren\u2019t being used to conceal illicit activity. Bitcoins\u2019 volatility has also attracted attention and raised questions about its viability as money. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can even call something a currency if it can change in value by 20 percent to 30 percent a day,\u201d Sophocles Sophocleous, a director at Argos Capital Management in Cyprus, said in a telephone interview today. \u201cAt the end of the day, I think people want something backing a currency.\u201d The digital currency plunged last week after China\u2019s central bank barred financial institutions from dealing in it. That followed a sudden surge in value in November after a U.S Justice Department official described Bitcoins as a \u201clegal means of exchange.\u201d The European Banking Authority today released a warning on the risks of using unregulated digital money that is susceptible to hackers. \u201cCases have been reported of consumers losing significant amounts of virtual currency with little prospect of having it returned,\u201d the EBA said in a statement on its website. \u201cWhen using virtual currency for commercial transactions, consumers are not protected by any refund rights under EU law.\u201d The price of Bitcoins topped $1,000, as speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. The price has since dropped to around $850 on Bitstamp, one of the more active online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars and other currencies. They were trading at about $12 a year ago. Norwegians marveled at the potential of the virtual currency when it emerged in October that a university student became a krone-millionaire after buying the coins. Kristoffer Koch bought $24 worth of Bitcoins in 2009 and then forgot about them until this year, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. When he checked his investment\u2019s value, it had soared to more than $800,000, helping him buy an apartment, NRK said Oct. 25. In Norway, profits from Bitcoin will fall under the wealth tax and losses can be deducted, Holte said. There will be a 25 percent sales tax that applies to businesses, he said. Introduced five years ago by a programmer, or group of programmers, going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoins can potentially reduce banking-transaction fees, making it an attractive option for trading via the Web or in stores. While tax revenue from Bitcoins isn\u2019t substantial, Holte at the Norwegian tax authority said he plans to work with other countries to hammer out the legal aspects of Bitcoin. Bitcoins\u2019 survival will ultimately depend on whether consumers and vendors decide they can trust it as a legitimate payment form, Ehling said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a crisis or power outage, you need some bills in your wallet in case your credit card doesn\u2019t work -- same goes with Bitcoins,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sustainable if people use it more and more, and if they trust it. People start with buying small things, but if they start to make bigger and bigger transactions, it could begin to challenge other currencies.

Yet unless customers bother to read these programs\u2019 service agreements, they may not realize these companies\u2014just like tech giants Google and Yahoo!\u2014honor requests for customer data made by governments and courts in cases involving potential security threats. That\u2019s one reason a new open-source encryption standard called Bitmessage, which is out of the NSA\u2019s reach and devilishly difficult to crack, is seeing a surge in users. New York-based developer Jonathan Warren says he had the NSA and its spying techniques very much in mind when creating the software. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t reasonably sure they were tracking our metadata, I wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d says the 28-year-old, who worked on Bitmessage in his spare time while employed at an educational company he declined to identify.  Bitmessage isn\u2019t owned by a corporation, nor does it rely on a centralized server that can be accessed by the government. Instead, the encryption software uses peer-to-peer technology that links computers into what is known as a distributed network. To retrieve a copy of an e-mail sent using Bitmessage, the government would have to gain access to an individual\u2019s computer. \u201cRight now, if the Iranian government wants to block Twitter or Gmail, they can. It would be much more difficult to block access to the Bitmessage network,\u201d says Adam Melton, a developer who collaborated with Warren. Warren drew inspiration from Bitcoin, the open-source protocol that established a virtual currency. Downloads of Bitmessage, which was introduced in November 2012, have more than quintupled since news broke in early June about NSA snooping, Warren says. Before that, most of the people using the software were in China; now more than 80 percent of downloads come from the U.S. Unlike competing products, Bitmessage also shields the identity of the parties in any online communication. Those who download the free software can create alternate e-mail addresses that are 36-character-long strings of letters and numbers. For ease of use, the new addresses can be stored and shared as a QR code, the pixelated squares that can be scanned with a smartphone. \u201cIt\u2019s the most secure messaging system that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d says Johannes Ullrich, chief research officer of the SANS Institute, a Bethesda (Md.)-based organization that certifies computer security specialists. While Bitmessage\u2019s creator says he was motivated by politics rather than profit\u2014Warren says his political inclinations are \u201clibertarian-ish\u201d\u2014experts say the software has commercial potential. \u201cNow that we understand how intrusive the government is being, it will be more important for the business sector to secure data. Not only medical records but lawyer-client communications,\u201d says Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based research group dedicated to libertarian principles. \u201cI don\u2019t know that a lawyer today will feel he\u2019s meeting his ethical obligations if he talks to his client on the phone.\u201d  Jarad Carleton, a San Francisco-based principal consultant at Frost & Sullivan, thinks investment bank mergers-and-acquisition teams could put software such as Bitmessage to good use. \u201cEconomic espionage has been going on for centuries,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are executives here in Silicon Valley that refuse to use encryption technologies because they feel it\u2019s too hard. They would definitely benefit from something easy to use.\u201d Ullrich, of the SANS Institute, believes that Bitmessage will not come into broader use until it is integrated with popular e-mail clients, such as Microsoft Outlook or Google\u2019s Gmail, the way the leading paid encryption services are. Cato\u2019s Harper sees another obstacle to adoption: Americans in general are not very exercised about privacy issues. In a new poll, 56 percent said they considered the NSA\u2019s accessing of phone records \u201cacceptable.\u201d Says Harper: \u201cThe question is whether people care enough to use these things.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-27/bitmessages-nsa-proof-e-mail', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 6, 27, 22, 41, 38, 892000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Bitmessage's NSA-Proof E-Mail"}, {'articleText': u'  New York\u2019s banking regulator issued subpoenas to about two dozen companies associated with bitcoin as it looks into the virtual-currency industry, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

While the alleged murder-for-hire plots aren\u2019t part of the government\u2019s indictment of Ulbricht, federal prosecutors in New York are seeking to use them as evidence against him at his trial set to begin Jan. 5. Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty to charges including Internet drug trafficking. The alleged murder schemes support the government\u2019s argument that Ulbricht conspired to protect the criminal enterprise, prosecutors said yesterday in a court filing. The evidence collected by U.S. investigators includes electronic communications retrieved from Ulbricht\u2019s laptop computer, according to the filing. The topics include the suspected theft of the digital currency used on Silk Road. \u201cUlbricht solicited these murders for hire as part of his role as owner and operator of Silk Road, to retaliate against a former staff member who he believed had stolen bitcoins from the site and who he feared would provide information about the site,\u201d said assistant U.S. attorneys Serrin Turner and Timothy Howard.

Ulbricht is charged with a murder-for-hire scheme in a separate case in  federal court in Baltimore.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, who\u2019s presiding over the case, ordered a Dec. 15 hearing to discuss the matter. According to prosecutors, Ulbricht also solicited the murder of a Silk Road vendor called \u201cFriendly Chemist\u201d who threatened to blackmail him by disclosing the identities of some of Silk Road\u2019s vendors and customers.

But those warp-speed ambitions are bumping up against the antiquated banking system, creating a near-term challenge for startups using the technology. ItBit, a New York-based firm that is weeks away from allowing its customers to settle and clear gold trades using Bankchain -- its in-house version of the blockchain digital ledger -- is confronting a payments system that\u2019s ill-prepared for the upgrade. Although ItBit can process trades in seconds or minutes, it still has to rely on others to transfer funds from buyers to sellers -- and that can take as long as four days, Chief Executive Officer Charles Cascarilla said. \u201cThe payments leg is some of the real difficulty here,\u201d he said in an interview. The services that move cash between financial firms and their customers \u201care all running lagged systems and none of them communicate efficiently,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need everyone else to catch up to us.\u201d ItBit is one of dozens of new companies seeking to use blockchain technology to revolutionize back-office functions for markets ranging from commodities to loans to bonds. Wall Street firms see the technology as a way to reduce costs and increase efficiency as they face stricter regulatory requirements following the 2008 financial crisis. While trading in stocks or derivatives is done in milliseconds, the verification and settlement of those transactions still take days. That sentiment was echoed Tuesday by industry executives at The Clearing House annual conference in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re still working with a payments and settlement system that\u2019s decades old,\u201d Michael Krimminger, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, said on a panel about blockchain. The new technology offers dramatic changes to how the current system works, he said. A distributed ledger like Bankchain allows transactions to be processed so quickly because all the users are connected through its network. As long as banks or exchanges, all of whom are known to each other, verify that one company has the funds or assets to transact with another company, the settlement and clearing time is reduced to seconds. That contrasts with the current banking system with firms that are walled off from each other and connected through decades-old payment services, causing rather simple processes to take several days to complete. Wall Street is motivated to reduce that time as dwindling revenues, increased costs and new capital requirements are all cutting into banks\u2019 bottom line. In the gold market, for example, a bank involved in a trade that takes four days to settle must set set aside capital for that amount of time. Reducing it to seconds frees up that cash. Another advantage of creating a distributed ledger system is the ease with which collateral can be moved from a customer to a bank to an exchange. "The reality is until you have money, i.e. fiat currency, able to be handled on the same ledger as other assets, you have to navigate the barrier of integrating with existing payment systems,\u201d Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, said in an interview. "This is not impossible, just less efficient. That\u2019s one reason people hope to see fiat currency issued in digital form.\u201d ItBit is expecting to have its existing customers able to use Bankchain by the end of December, with large financial institutions joining the system in the first three months of 2016, Cascarilla said. After ItBit itself, those firms will become the first \u201cnodes\u201d on the Bankchain network in a process that\u2019s needed to create a distributed ledger for many different types of financial products. Banks have spent years adding to their existing payment systems rather than starting from scratch. For example, Cascarilla said he knew of a major financial institution that has 53 systems it uses to connect with Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., the U.S. clearinghouse for stock and bond trades. In another case, he said a separate firm had only six employees left who knew how to write Cobol, the computer programming language that dates back to the 1950s that most of Wall Street\u2019s architecture is built upon. He declined to name either firm. Masters said this is a real threat. \u201cThis is a strategic problem for the owners of that infrastructure,\u201d she said Tuesday as part of the panel discussion at The Clearing House conference. ItBit needed to create Bankchain because the current blockchain that powers the digital currency bitcoin isn\u2019t well-suited to other financial applications, Cascarilla said. While bitcoin is very secure and transparent, it lacks functionality to serve as a place to record financial transactions, he said. \u201cTrying to use the bitcoin network to do complicated financial services is science fiction at the moment,\u201d he said. Another antiquated part of banking that distributed ledgers seek to disrupt is the way firms have separate departments that handle payments and settlement. That\u2019s just one more layer of communication that has to be handled before a trade can be verified, Cheryl Gurz, senior vice president of retail bank operations at The Bancorp Inc. said during the panel. \u201cOn the securities side, I\u2019m excited about settlement happening at the same time payment happens,\u201d she said. While that\u2019s the goal for the financial word, it will take time for distributed ledgers to reach that potential. \u201cThe work being done now is the work that needs to be done\u201d to lay that groundwork, Masters said during the panel.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mattleising', 'name': u'Matthew Leising', 'twitterhandle': u'mattleising'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-18/blockchain-revolution-butts-head-with-creaky-banking-pay-systems', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 18, 14, 49, 51, 625000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Blockchain Revolution Butts Head With Creaky Banking Pay Systems'}, {'articleText': u'  Russia is seeking to outlaw virtual currencies like bitcoins by introducing fines for transactions using unregulated digital money. Private individuals could be fined up to 50,000 rubles ($1,250) and public officials up to 100,000 rubles, the Finance Ministry said in a statement today describing the draft law.

Several companies have determined that the biggest opportunity to prove their worth is in the decidedly boring race to help emigres handle remittances, a global market expected to total $550 billion this year, according to the World Bank. One startup with its own virtual currency, Ripple Labs, said on Monday that it would begin transferring cash into its network at the hundreds of thousands of convenience stores, pharmacies, and other businesses around the world where ZipZap payments are accepted. ZipZap, which is accepted in about 700,000 locations worldwide, is currently used as a way to pay cash for online purchases. Any pair of people with Ripple Labs accounts can now use the software to move money in what could be Ripple\u2019s first step toward cracking the global remittance market. Getting into remittances would be a big prize\u2014one eyed by Bitcoin startups as well. The average fee on remittances is 9 percent of the transaction cost, and some banks charge additional \u201clifting\u201d fees of up to 5 percent when someone wants to turn the remittance into cash. ZipZap, on the other hand, has a flat fee of $3.95 to send up to $500 in cash. Sitting in the middle of money transmissions is a lucrative business.\xa0Western Union brought in $4.6 billion in transaction fees charged to consumers last year and almost $1 billion further in foreign-exchange revenue from its consumer business. The company enjoys net profit margins of about 16 percent, making it a target that appears ripe for disruption by virtual-currency competitors able to remove the steps at which intermediaries take their cut. It\u2019s too early to tell whether the upstarts can make it. Ripple and ZipZap have an obvious hurdle to overcome before they\u2019ll disrupt much of anything: There\u2019s no easy way for someone on the receiving end to turn a virtual payment into real-world currency.\xa0\u201dBefore you have cash-out you have to have cash-in, so we have to work in chronological order,\u201d says Alan Safahi, ZipZap\u2019s chief executive officer. Recipients will need a Ripple account before they could accept a ZipZap remittance; right now there are only about 27,000 Ripple accounts in the world. Bitcoin\u2019s user base is much bigger. Still, selling people on the appeals of virtual currencies is the same challenge faced by a few startups that want to use Bitcoin for remittances. Bitcoin exchanges already allow people to turn the currency into various local currencies, and such countries as China and Argentina are developing healthy exchange markets. But many of the countries counted among the largest recipients of remittances don\u2019t have enough people using Bitcoins to make this process reliable. Buttercoin, a startup backed by Google Ventures and Y Combinator, believes a quicker path to relevance is to relegate Bitcoin to a behind-the-scenes role. The company\xa0is working with licensed money transmitters in several countries to establish software systems in which currencies can be automatically converted\u2014first into Bitcoin, then into another currency. Buttercoin will focus on a few markets at first, such as the $3.4 billion in annual remittances sent from from Canada to India. The company says it will take a commission of less than 1 percent. A major appeal of the system is that users won\u2019t necessarily know they are using Bitcoin\u2014or even have heard of it. \u201cThe migrant workers who are using the system may not know what Bitcoin is, but they are going to use it,\u201d says Cedric Dahl, Buttercoin\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe\u2019re giving the world a reason to care.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-08/will-migrant-workers-drive-bitcoins-mundane-future', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 10, 8, 10, 11, 55, 689000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Will Migrant Workers Drive Bitcoin's Mundane Future?"}, {'articleText': u'  New York\u2019s top financial regulator told Bitcoin entrepreneurs he\u2019ll prevent their companies from abetting money laundering even at the risk of stamping out innovation in the embryonic virtual-currency industry. As he convened two days of hearings yesterday on the regulation of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, Benjamin Lawsky, the state\u2019s superintendent of financial services, said New York will be the first to propose rules for the new technology\u2019s oversight. The hearings began a day after a Bitcoin promoter was indicted on money-laundering charges. Bitcoin entrepreneurs at the hearing -- including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, early backers of Facebook Inc. -- said overzealous regulators could stifle the fledgling technology\u2019s promise to reduce costs and fraud in the existing payments system dominated by companies such as Visa Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Today\u2019s hearing will begin with testimony from law enforcement officials. \u201cIf the choice for regulators is to permit money laundering on the one hand, or to permit innovation on the other, we are always going to choose squelching the money laundering first,\u201d Lawsky said at the hearing. Lawsky convened the hearings a day after federal prosecutors indicted a prominent figure among Bitcoin entrepreneurs, Charlie Shrem, for alleged money laundering linked to Silk Road, a Bitcoin-driven website allegedly used buying for drugs and other illicit goods. Shrem, the chief executive officer of exchange company BitInstant, yesterday resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, a group promoting the currency, the organization said in a blog post. In a two-hour session, Lawsky and his staff debated with a group of investors in virtual currency companies over the potential for the technology to cut costs and reduce fraud in the payments system. Law enforcement officials including Cyrus Vance Jr., the New York district attorney, lead off today\u2019s testimony. Bitcoin, a software protocol for issuing and moving money across the Internet, has gained traction with merchants selling everything from Sacramento Kings basketball tickets to kitchen mixers on Overstock.com. Venture capitalists see it as an alternative to the global payment system currently dominated by companies including Visa, Western Union and large banks. The price of Bitcoin rose 3.6 percent yesterday to $844.88 at 5:30 p.m. New York time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Federal regulators in March said Bitcoin-related businesses can be handled as state-licensed money transmitters, triggering a race by some states to assess their own rules. Only New York has publicly contemplated creating rules specifically for virtual currency companies -- what Lawsky has called a \u201cBitLicense.\u201d The idea got a skeptical reception from industry participants at the hearing, who argued to Lawsky that regulation could stifle innovation. \u201cIt is difficult to determine the problems the BitLicense idea is meant to solve, or how well it would solve them,\u201d Marco Santori, chairman of the regulatory affairs committee of the Bitcoin Foundation, said in written testimony for the hearing. The Winklevoss brothers, who are seeking regulatory approval for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, pointed out that federal regulators have said their legal tools are enough. \u201cWe agree,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cWe also believe the same is true of state law.\u201d Fred Wilson, managing partner of Union Square Ventures, a New York venture capital firm, said at the hearing that existing rules on money laundering and consumer protection \u201care probably the right kind of regulations.\u201d \u201cWe should not regulate how the system itself operates,\u201d Wilson said. At the same time, Wilson also suggested that New York might adopt a simplified rule in which companies notify the regulator they are operating, and are in a legal \u201csafe harbor\u201d for a certain period of time. Lawsky\u2019s general counsel, Daniel Alter, countered that \u201csimply knowing somebody is operating\u201d isn\u2019t enough for regulators. \u201cIt would be great for any industry if you could simply open the doors,\u201d Alter said. Jeremy Liew, a partner with Menlo Park, California-based Lightspeed Ventures, argued that the current system has so far worked well to stop illicit use of Bitcoin, and that new rules could push startups away. \u201cIf that same company can be started in the U.K. or Germany, maybe that innovation just gets pushed offshore,\u201d Liew said. Lawsky, speaking near the rebuilt World Trade Center in New York, said that regulators have to focus on how to prevent money laundering that can play a role in crimes like the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, not simply investigating after the fact. \u201cThe first job is to get rid of money laundering,\u201d he said. One option for New York would be to apply regulations that existing companies, such as Western Union Co. or MoneyGram International Inc., fall under, said Barry Silbert, chief executive of SecondMarket Inc., which runs a Bitcoin investment fund. \u201cExpanding the existing money transmitter rules is a good first step that does not preclude others,\u201d Silbert said. In an interview after the hearing, Lawsky said the complexity of the emerging virtual currency business suggests his department needs to do more than extend current rules. \u201cIt\u2019s feeling more like little tweaks around the edges are not enough,\u201d Lawsky said. Lawsky at times sympathized with the goals of the investors at the hearing, complaining that it could take \u201cdays\u201d to pay his credit card from a bank account. And he criticized fees immigrants pay to send money home, and welcomed the chance to use Bitcoin to reduce the costs. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge thing, for the country and New Yorkers,\u201d Lawsky said. Israel Klein, a principal at the Podesta Group, a Washington-based public affairs firm, said the Shrem arrest threatens to undo what progress the nascent industry has made in convincing regulators of Bitcoin\u2019s promise. \u201cThe Bitcoin ecosystem of companies and investors has to engage to allay real concerns and avoid being pigeonholed by policy makers,\u201d Klein said.

Many Bitcoin tycoons are devoting themselves to expanding the currency\u2019s reach. Yifu Guo was a digital media student at New York University when he began mining some of the first coins, occasionally cashing in a few to help pay his rent.

Many Bitcoin tycoons are devoting themselves to expanding the currency\u2019s reach. Yifu Guo was a digital media student at New York University when he began mining some of the first coins, occasionally cashing in a few to help pay his rent. After he recognized Bitcoin\u2019s potential, he quit school and founded a company called Avalon, which sells hardware built solely for the purpose of mining Bitcoins. He isn\u2019t interested in a quick score, he says: \u201cOur goal is to protect the Bitcoin network so profits are available in the long term.\u201d Tony Gallippi is CEO of BitPay, a payment processor he co-founded in 2011 that enables online merchants to accept Bitcoins. He says he includes Bitcoins in his investment portfolio along with stocks, bonds, and real estate. His company holds some Bitcoins as well. \u201cWe\u2019d like to take advantage of the price appreciation. Everything we do to sign up more merchants and customers grows the user base.\u201d That, in turn, lifts the value of BitPay\u2019s own holdings. Shrem, who estimates that his assets are split between Bitcoins and dollars, says he is not as driven by ideology as were some of the earliest Bitcoin adopters. Every time the price goes up 20\xa0percent, he plans to cash in about 100\xa0coins. Kenna, meanwhile, says he has no plans to cash out. \u201cI\u2019m doubling down.\u201d \nApril 11, 3:53pm: Updated to include mention of the Winklevoss twins\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-10/meet-the-bitcoin-millionaires', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 4, 12, 16, 41, 30, 619000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Meet the Bitcoin Millionaires'}, {'articleText': u'  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. invested in a $50 million fundraising round in bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd., another sign of the growing interest in digital currency technology by established financial institutions. IDG Capital Partners co-led the round, which also included existing Circle investors such as Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Accel Partners and Oak Investment Partners, Circle said in a statement late Wednesday. The company offers a variety of services for storing and using bitcoins. The round brings Circle\u2019s total funding to $76 million, and \u201cis a material step-up in valuation from our past financing,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, chief executive officer of the Boston-based venture, said in a telephone interview. He declined to disclose the specific value. IDG Capital, which is based in China, could help Circle expand into that country, while Goldman Sachs could eventually become a business partner, Allaire said. Goldman Sachs\u2019s participation came through its principal strategic investments group, which invests the firm\u2019s own money in exchanges and other electronic platforms. \u201cOur hope is to work with Goldman on a commercial basis as we grow the business,\u201d Allaire said. Circle plans to use the funding for product development and international expansion, he said. Some of the money may go toward marketing a new feature that lets Circle customers hold, send and receive U.S. dollars with no fees. The feature will help turn the company into an international money-transfer service, a peer-to-peer payment service and a bank. Eventually, there are plans to move into other currencies, such as the Chinese yuan, he said. \u201cWe think of ourselves as a consumer-finance company,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cWith the advent of open Internet platforms, it\u2019s now possible to provide some of the traditional capabilities that traditional retail banking provided, as a free service.\u201d In January, the New York Stock Exchange said it would invest in Coinbase, a platform for trading digital currency.

Bates testified he threatened to stop providing free computer help unless Ulbricht told him about the project. Prosecutors claim Ulbricht, 30, was the mastermind behind Silk Road, where anonymous users paid bitcoins for drugs and other contraband. Ulbricht, who the U.S. says was known online as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d faces as long as life in prison if he\u2019s convicted. Bates frowned throughout his testimony, as the government worked to tie Ulbricht to the actions of his online alter ego, named for an elusive buccaneer in the film \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d Prosecutors yesterday introduced what they said are journal entries by Ulbricht chronicling Silk Road\u2019s start and growth into a multimillion-dollar business. Ulbricht denies wrongdoing. He says he started Silk Road but left after a few months because it was too stressful. Ulbricht claims he was set up as a \u201cfall guy\u201d by Mark Karpeles, the former head of the bankrupt Mt. Gox Co. bitcoin exchange and the true Silk Road boss. Karpeles has said he had nothing to do with Silk Road. Bates testified that he lied to investigators who came to his apartment shortly after Ulbricht was arrested in October 2013, telling them he wasn\u2019t aware of his friend\u2019s connection to Silk Road. Bates told the jury that he later agreed to cooperate with authorities as part of a non-prosecution deal. Under the agreement, prosecutors won\u2019t charge Bates for his work on Silk Road, for a separate, unrealized project to set up a bitcoin exchange with Ulbricht, or for buying drugs for his own use from Silk Road. Bates said he purchased marijuana, MDMA, hallucinogenic mushrooms, Vicodin and an antibiotic from Silk Road using the name \u201cMelee.\u201d Bates said he met Ulbricht at the University of Texas at Dallas, where he studied computer science and his friend earned a degree in physics. The two remained connected on Facebook after graduation, and rekindled their friendship in 2010 when both lived in Austin, Texas. Ulbricht frequently asked for help with programming problems beginning in late 2010, Bates testified. Bates said he became suspicious when Ulbricht asked questions about using PHP, a computer code often used on Web servers. When he asked his friend what he was working on, Ulbricht would only say that it was \u201ctop secret,\u201d Bates testified. \u201cI\u2019m officially forbidding you from mentioning your secret project to me again unless you are going to reveal it,\u201d he said to Ulbricht in a Feb. 28, 2011, computer chat shown to the jury. Soon after, Bates said he told Ulbricht in person: \u201cTell me about it or leave me out of it.\u201d \u201cHe said \u2018I\u2019m working on a website where people can buy drugs,\u2019\u201d Bates testified. \u201cI was shocked, but I was also very intrigued,\u201d Bates said. \u201cI think my first reaction was: They\u2019re going to shut this down really, really soon.\u201d Bates said Ulbricht explained that the site channeled communications through the Tor network, which concealed users\u2019 identities, and required the use of bitcoin virtual currency for all transactions. In a computer chat in early 2011, Ulbricht told Bates that Silk Road was the subject of a 40-minute segment on a national radio program. \u201cfriggin crazy, you gotta keep my secret, buddy,\u201d Ulbricht wrote. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone and I don\u2019t intend to,\u201d Bates answered. \u201cI know I can trust you,\u201d Ulbricht said. Bates said he continued to help Ulbricht with Silk Road until mid-2011, when he became uncomfortable with the scrutiny the site was getting in the press and from government officials. He said Ulbricht didn\u2019t pay him and that he helped him out of friendship. At a party at Bates\u2019s apartment in November 2011, a panicked Ulbricht told him that someone posted a comment to his Facebook page referring to his online drug-dealing, Bates testified. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to shut the site down,\u201d Bates said he told Ulbricht. \u201cThis is not worth going to jail over.\u201d Ulbricht responded that he couldn\u2019t shut the site down because he had sold it, Bates told jurors.

Banks operating in the U.K. should amend employee contracts so they can recoup bonus payments from workers who exceed their risk limits or break financial-conduct rules, the central bank said in a statement on its website yesterday. The rules, which come into force on Jan. 1, are part of a move by global regulators to hit bankers\u2019 wallets if their risk-taking leads to large losses. The U.K. measures go beyond minimum European Union standards, which require at least 40 percent of awards to be deferred for at least three years, and hand banks some clawback powers. U.S. rules on banker pay have mainly targeted bailed-out banks. Bank Risks Hidden From Investors to Be Disclosed in Sweden Sweden will start publishing banks\u2019 individual capital requirements in a step designed to reveal risks investors have so far been unable to measure based on reported buffers. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority is planning to follow its Danish counterpart and disclose so-called Pillar 2 requirements as Scandinavia leads Europe in stepping up efforts to improve transparency. In Denmark, which like Sweden has a bank industry whose assets are four times gross domestic product, lenders can be shut down by the regulator if reserves drop below individual requirements. Disclosing bank-specific capital needs, which are set by national regulators, isn\u2019t required under Basel III or European capital rules. Pillar 2 requirements can in some cases more than double the minimum amount of equity and debt a bank must hold to absorb losses. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision sets out three Pillars for a sound financial system. The first imposes industrywide capital requirements, and the third draws on market discipline by forcing banks to show how they meet those requirements. Sweden already requires its biggest banks to meet some of the world\u2019s most rigorous capital standards, ranging from 14 percent for Nordea Bank AB to 19 percent for Swedbank AB. In May the FSA said banks should hold a 1 percent counter-cyclical buffer after household debt burdens swelled to a record. BofA on Brink of Burying Countrywide Woes as Lender Nears Accord Bank of America Corp. is about to learn how much it really paid for its 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp.: about $70 billion. The original $2.5 billion price tag swelled as the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company resolved more than a dozen legal disputes with the U.S. government, investors and bond insurers over loans that fueled the financial crisis. Bank of America and the U.S. Justice Department are nearing a settlement as soon as this week after the company increased its offer from $13 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The Justice Department had sought $17 billion, the people said. A deal would come on top of about $55 billion in mortgage settlements, mostly tied to Countrywide. Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to comment on talks with the Justice Department. Bitcoin Tax-Free Transactions Face Test at EU\u2019s Highest Court Tax-free trading of bitcoin faces a legal test at the European Union\u2019s top court after Swedish authorities sought to extend existing levies to virtual currencies. The EU Court of Justice must decide whether transactions between virtual and traditional currencies can be classed as a service under EU value-added tax rules, and if so, whether such trades are tax-exempt, according to a court filing. The case may help clarify powers of tax authorities over bitcoins as central bankers who regulate supplies of traditional currencies from the euro to the pound grapple with their emergence as an alternative means of payment. Banks shouldn\u2019t buy, hold or sell virtual currencies until regulators develop safeguards to protect their integrity, the European Banking Authority said earlier this month, citing risks including identity theft and the possibility that hackers could target a trading platform.

Florida Circuit Judge Fleur Lobree today in Miami rejected Reid\u2019s argument that the state\u2019s money transfer statute only referred to corporations, not individuals. Reid\u2019s attorney, Ron Lowy, said after the hearing he was disappointed Lobree didn\u2019t address his contention that Bitcoin isn\u2019t money.

Fifty-five percent of those surveyed said the virtual currency trades at unsustainable, bubble-like prices, according to the quarterly poll of 562 investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers. Another 14 percent said it\u2019s on the verge of a bubble. Only 6 percent of respondents said a bubble isn\u2019t forming. The remaining 25 percent were unsure. The results show skepticism of the virtual currency even as technology entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and hedge funds plow money and effort into building it into a global payment system. Bitcoin prices have swung between more than $900 to as low as $341 this year as enthusiasts try to address the digital currency\u2019s weaknesses, persuade consumers to embrace it and overcome governments\u2019 concerns that it could be misused by criminals. Bitcoins emerged from a 2008 paper written by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, becoming the most popular virtual currency. It relies on a public ledger and cryptography to record transactions and protect ownership. Bloomberg\u2019s poll, conducted July 15-16 by Selzer & Co., a Des Moines, Iowa-based firm, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. Bitcoins, which traded for about $13 at the start of last year, were valued at about $625 late yesterday. Prices plummeted in the first quarter as the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, once the world\u2019s largest, collapsed and as governments around the world sought to head off money laundering, warned about thefts and tightened regulation. The price has rebounded since hitting this year\u2019s low in April, climbing 83 percent as entrepreneurs announced projects to facilitate the currency\u2019s use. Merchants including Expedia Inc., Dish Network Corp. and Overstock.com Inc. have decided to accept bitcoins. A total of 63,000 businesses now take the virtual currency, and people have set up more than 5 million wallets to keep their digital holdings, according to CoinDesk, which tracks its use. Xapo, a provider of secure online storage for bitcoins, said July 8 it doubled the amount of money it has raised from investors to $40 million, the most gathered by a startup focused on the virtual currency. Earlier this month, venture capitalist Tim Draper, 56, bought a cache of almost 30,000 bitcoins that were auctioned off by the government. That enthusiasm contrasts with opinions expressed by finance-industry leaders. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, has said bitcoins probably won\u2019t last as a currency after governments subject them to rules and standards akin to those for other payment systems. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, 83, has said he\u2019ll be surprised if bitcoins last 10 or 20 years. A Bloomberg poll in January showed investor doubts in the virtual currency as well. Almost half of 477 international investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers were bearish on bitcoins and said they would sell them. At the time, bitcoins traded about 30 percent above current levels. Online surveys have shown more enthusiasm for the virtual currency.

Trendon Shavers, founder of Bitcoin Savings and Trust, raised at least 764,000 bitcoins by promising investors a return of as much as 3,641 percent, prosecutors said. Instead, he used bitcoins from new investors to cover payments owed to earlier clients, while also tapping into the currency to pay for his own Las Vegas gambling and spa treatments, they said. At the peak of his scheme in 2011 and 2012, Shavers held about 7 percent of all bitcoins in circulation, they said. \u201cShavers managed to combine financial and cyber-fraud into a bitcoin Ponzi scheme that offered absurdly high interest payments and ultimately cheated his investors,\u201d U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement today. Shavers\u2019s arrest comes as the U.S. intensifies its scrutiny of bitcoins. Prosecutors last year charged Ross William Ulbricht with running the $1.2 billion online bazaar called Silk Road in which drug dealers used the digital currency to buy heroin, phony passports and hacking services. He denies wrongdoing. Today, Bharara accused another man, Blake Benthall, with operating a virtually identical site called Silk Road 2.0. Shavers, 32, was arrested today at his home in McKinney, Texas, by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. He\u2019s charged with securities fraud and wire fraud, which carry maximum prison sentences of 20 years. He\u2019s scheduled to appear in federal court in Sherman, Texas. In September, Shavers and Bitcoin Savings were fined $40.6 million in a civil suit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The case was the first to determine whether the SEC had authority to regulate transactions in virtual currency. According to prosecutors, Shavers, using the name \u201cpirateat40,\u201d solicited investments in his company on Bitcoin Forum, an online site, by offering weekly interest of as much as 7 percent. Those lending the firm bitcoins were told they could withdraw the investments at any time, prosecutors said. Shavers told investors their bitcoins would be used to support a market-arbitrage strategy that included lending them, trading them on online exchanges and selling them locally in private transactions, according to the U.S. Shavers \u201clargely failed\u201d to execute the investment strategy, prosecutors said. Rather, he used new bitcoins to cover interest payments and meet investor withdrawal requests, Bharara said. He also used investor funds for day trading in his own account on a bitcoin-currency exchange and exchanged bitcoins into U.S. currency that paid personal expenses such as gambling and a $1,000 steakhouse meal. In the other case announced today, prosecutors claim Benthall started Silk Road 2.0 just five weeks after Ulbricht\u2019s arrest for running Silk Road. Benthall is charged with narcotics trafficking and other crimes. He was arrested yesterday in San Francisco. Ulbricht, who was known as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d is scheduled to go on trial in January. Ex-Bitcoin Foundation Vice Chairman Charlie Shrem and a second man have pleaded guilty to charges tied to Silk Road, which the U.S. shut down last year. The cases are U.S. v.

Forrest rejected Ulbricht\u2019s attempt to block the government from introducing evidence he tried to arrange six murders, including a hit on a former employee he believed had stolen $350,000 in bitcoins. In another alleged plot, prosecutors claim Ulbricht paid someone $150,000 to kill a Silk Road user who called himself FriendlyChemist. The government claims FriendlyChemist sought to extort Ulbricht by threatening to publish a list of the names and addresses of Silk Road sellers and buyers unless he was paid $500,000. Ulbricht, who is separately charged in Baltimore federal court with the alleged plot against the former employee, doesn\u2019t face murder solicitation charges in the New York trial. Forrest said the government may use the evidence to tie him to Silk Road and to narcotics trafficking. Prosecutors have said they have no proof that any murders were actually carried out. In November 2013, a U.S. magistrate judge cited those alleged plots in denying Ulbricht\u2019s request for bail. He\u2019s confined in a federal prison in downtown Manhattan. Ulbricht\u2019s online name was taken from a character in the 1987 film \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d prosecutors said. He\u2019s charged with running Silk Road from 2011 to 2013. The Texas native was arrested in a San Francisco public library on Oct. 1, after logging onto his computer as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d prosecutors said. Federal agents seized Silk Road, along with bitcoins worth $3.6 million, and shut down the site on Oct. 2, 2013. Prosecutors said in court filings that the site generated $80 million in commissions on sales of more than $1 billion in less than three years. Three Silk Road employees were charged in addition to Ulbricht. Blake Benthall, 26, was charged in November with starting a almost identical online market called \u201cSilk Road 2.0\u201d weeks after Ulbricht\u2019s arrest. Benthall\u2019s arrest was part of a coordinated operation by 16 countries targeting the Tor network, which allows people to use the Internet anonymously by routing traffic through multiple servers. U.S. and European agencies said they shut down 410 hidden web domains, arrested 17 people and seized about $1 million in bitcoins. Last month, former Bitcoin Foundation Inc. executive Charlie Shrem was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to transferring money he knew was to be used for illegal transactions. Shrem was arrested in January 2014 when he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York after giving a speech in Amsterdam about bitcoins. Robert Faiella, who operated the BTCKing exchange and was charged with Shrem, pleaded guilty to running an illegal money business and is awaiting sentencing. Forrest in October rejected Ulbricht\u2019s request to bar electronic evidence seized by government agents from his Gmail and Facebook accounts, a laptop and a computer server in Iceland. The judge ruled that Ulbricht, who didn\u2019t make any claim to a privacy interest in the materials, couldn\u2019t show that his rights were violated. If he had made such a claim, she said, prosecutors could question him about it if he testifies in his own defense. The criminal case is U.S. v.

A prolonged price drop could also, at least temporarily, put the future of the currency in question because the equipment and power needed to mine new bitcoins are so expensive. Mining new bitcoins is key to the underlying technology. On the flip side, many proponents of bitcoin appreciate its relative anonymity and transaction verification via a public ledger. And despite the recent drop, some of the biggest backers of bitcoin say they aren\u2019t fleeing. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on the recent price movement, other than saying I\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Barry Silbert, chief executive officer of SecondMarket Holdings Inc., said in an e-mailed response to questions. Silbert\u2019s company was part of a bidding group that won 48,000 bitcoins at a U.S. government auction in December. A bitcoin could be worth $100 or $1 million, and its value will fluctuate as new uses for the currency\u2019s underlying technology emerge, Luria said. Venture capitalists, including Tim Draper, have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into startups that are building new software on top of bitcoin technology. And companies from Microsoft Corp. to a Lamborghini dealership have said they accept bitcoin as payment. With the value of bitcoin once topping $1,100 in 2013, the last year -- and this week, in particular -- has been a dramatic reversal of fortunes.

The Justice Department said Thursday that Ali Shukri Amin raised funds for Islamic State, also known as ISIL, and helped facilitate travel for supporters. The charges come as the government expands its effort to prosecute not only Americans seeking to join the group but also those attempting to recruit for it. \u201cToday\u2019s guilty plea demonstrates that those who use social media as a tool to provide support and resources to ISIL will be identified and prosecuted with no less vigilance than those who travel to take up arms with ISIL,\u201d Dana J.

Dozens of U.S. residents have been recruited by Islamic State to fight in the Middle East or carry out attacks in the U.S. In Garland, Texas, two Muslim men from Phoenix attacked a Muhammad cartoon contest last month and were killed by security guards. ISIS claimed responsibility for inspiring them. Amin, 17, admitted to using Twitter to provide advice and encouragement to ISIL and its supporters, according to a statement of facts filed with the plea agreement. He allegedly provided instruction on how to use Bitcoin to mask funds sent to the group and helped an 18-year-old Prince William County resident travel to Syria to join it in January. That teen, Reza Niknejad, was charged Wednesday with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and conspiring to kill and injure people abroad. Separately, prosecutors made a fifth arrest in an alleged plot by two New York roommates to travel to Syria and join Islamic State. Akmal Zakirov, an Uzbek national, pleaded not guilty in Brooklyn federal court Thursday to charges of attempting and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. Zakirov along with two other men, including one who operated mobile phone repair kiosks in shopping malls, are accused of helping to finance the Brooklyn roommates\u2019 travel plans. U.S. Magistrate Judge Viktor V. Pohorelsky ordered that Zakirov be held without bail. He faces as long as 30 years in prison if convicted.

It\u2019s what you get when you combine bitcoin, one of the world\u2019s newest would-be currencies, and gold, one of the oldest.

We can coalesce.\u201d Despite the skepticism, bitcoin and gold make a natural match, like kittens and milk. Gold, a store of value since ancient times, has long been popular with investors seeking a haven and doomsayers rejecting fiat currencies churned out on central bank printing presses. Bitcoin, cooked up by programmers six years ago, has been embraced by hipster anarchists and others eager to trade online while avoiding the constraints of conventional money. There are signs that the two sides are finally meeting cute. Last month, DNA Precious Metals Inc., which digs for gold and silver residue in Quebec, Canada, formed a subsidiary called DNA Crypto Corp. to mine online. The Montreal-based company, a penny stock that trades over-the-counter, saw its market shifting to a new unit of exchange for the digital age and wanted to take part, Tony Giuliano, the chief financial officer, said in an interview. Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, the Harvard University-educated twins famous for their dispute with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg, are planning to introduce the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund reminiscent of the SPDR Gold Shares fund. Their application, which would be the first of its kind, is pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission. An e-mail to New York-based Winklevoss Capital Management LLC wasn\u2019t answered. There\u2019s no doubt any marriage, or at least an online date, would be between unequals. Bitcoin, which has endured wild price swings since its introduction, now has about $8 billion in circulation, according to CoinDesk, a news and pricing website. Gold, with centuries of a head start, boasts an $18 trillion-a-year global market, according to CPM Group, a New York-based research company. Bitcoin originated in a 2008 paper by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It uses a public ledger and cryptography to\xa0log transactions and secure ownership. Prices plummeted earlier this year from a high of $1,147 in 2013 after the collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, once the world\u2019s largest, and China and Russia moved to block money laundering. One bitcoin currently sells for about $600, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Virtual Currency Monitor. Gold prices are less volatile. They ranged from $1,182.57 to $1,433.73 an ounce in the past year. The metal has climbed 7.8 percent to $1,294.75 in 2014 after the first annual decline in 13 years. While bitcoin has drawn attention to the shortcomings of government-issued currencies, it also highlights the advantages of gold, according to John Brynjolfsson, the chief investment officer at Irvine, California-based hedge fund Armored Wolf LLC, which oversees about $671 million. Unlike bitcoin, gold has intrinsic value that can\u2019t fall to zero, has a long track record of moving against the dollar, and can survive an electronic disruption, he said. Bitcoin skepticism is high, according to the latest quarterly poll of 562 investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers. Fifty-five percent said the virtual currency trades at unsustainable, bubble-like prices, and 14 percent said it\u2019s on the verge of a bubble. Six percent said a bubble isn\u2019t forming, and 25 percent were unsure. The poll didn\u2019t measure any investor skepticism of gold. More recent bitcoin investors have focused on its potential as a payment system. Entrepreneurs such as Coinbase and Circle Internet Financial see virtual currencies as a way for people to make purchases online as easily as they share cat videos, without the costs and risks of bank transfers. \u201cGold has always been seen as the ultimate store of value, and bitcoin is seen as the ultimate modern medium of exchange,\u201d said Simon Hamblin, the London-based CEO of Netagio Ltd., which operates an online exchange for trading among gold, bitcoins and British pounds.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/gold-bugs-meet-bitcoin-believers-to-supplant-the-dollar', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 28, 4, 0, 23, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Gold Bugs Meet Bitcoin Believers to Supplant the Dollar'}, {'articleText': u"  The criminal charges against five men who authorities tracked down after last year\u2019s hacking attack on JPMorgan Chase & Co. leave one very important question. Where are the hackers? The complaints filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court against the men are unrelated to hacking and are narrowly tailored to claims of securities fraud and a bitcoin scam in Florida. But they are a key step in an elaborate investigative gamble to crack the hacking case, according to three people familiar with the investigators\u2019 strategy who provided details of events leading up to the arrests. The investigators\u2019 immediate goal is to unearth new evidence from those arrested. They could then fortify their existing case by adding charges that link one or more of those arrested with the Wall Street hacking spree, now known to have affected Fidelity Investments Ltd., E*Trade Financial Corp. and other financial institutions as well as JPMorgan. There is an even more elusive quarry. Investigators suspect the actual keyboard work was done by an elite group of Russian cyber criminals who may have partnered with the alleged stock fraudsters and who may have had additional criminal motives. The men charged simply don\u2019t have the kind of computer skills needed for the JPMorgan attack, the investigators have concluded. Because some of them traveled frequently to Russia, they may have interacted directly with the real hackers. The FBI savors the prospect of interrogating anyone who could provide rich and colorful evidence against this type of cybercriminal, long untouchable by U.S. law enforcement. A lot of things have to fall into place before a victory can be claimed by authorities who have followed the digital trail for nearly a year from JPMorgan\u2019s data center to intermediate points in Ukraine and South Africa, then to Russia, Israel and back to the U.S. From the early days of their investigation, officials sensed an opportunity to break a long losing streak. For years, hackers operating from safe havens in China and Eastern Europe have rifled secret government data centers and the computer networks of thousands of American companies with little chance of ever ending up in an American court. In the JPMorgan case, the trail of evidence rapidly led investigators to men well within their reach. The unlikely group included a pair of former Florida State University frat buddies and an alleged group of Israeli stock schemers. According to those close to the investigation, the primary architects are believed to be an Israeli man, Gery Shalon, who was arrested in Israel Tuesday and charged with defrauding investors by pumping up the value of low volume stocks, and Joshua Samuel Aaron, who grew up in Potomac, Maryland, and charted a conventional path in middle-class America before his alleged involvement in a complex international fraud scheme. With Shalon and others in custody, the investigation is moving into high gear after months of plodding work. It\u2019s unlikely that U.S. agents will be allowed to conduct the initial interrogations of Shalon, who appeared Wednesday in a Jerusalem court. According to one of the people familiar with the case, the FBI has prepared questions for the Israeli police and agents are available for real-time consultations, depending on Shalon\u2019s willingness to cooperate. Anthony Murgio, Aaron\u2019s old college friend, who is charged with running a money-laundering scheme through his Coin.mx bitcoin exchange, was arrested early Tuesday at his home in Florida, according to the FBI. He wasn\u2019t booked until 6:30 p.m., according to Pinellas County jail officials. It's unknown if those intervening hours were spent with FBI interrogators. One or more of the men in custody will be pressed to become a cooperating witness, providing prosecutors with more evidence and perhaps even a road map to the Wall Street hacks, according to the people familiar with the investigation. Of the five men charged, Aaron is still at large. Prosecutors need that help because of significant weaknesses in their hacking case, three people familiar with the investigation said. According to an October FBI memo, agents had early evidence pointing to Aaron and his long-time friend, Murgio. People familiar with the probe said Aaron signed in to some servers used in the attack that agents managed to trace back to him. E-mails subpoenaed later also suggest a link between Aaron and Shalon and the attacks, they said. A series of meetings between agents and prosecutors began last fall and continued until earlier this year. The two sides wrangled over the evidence linking the men and a growing circle of associates to the hacks. The FBI kept pressing for a date to make arrests, and prosecutors kept pushing it back, asking for more evidence and stronger links. Prosecutors found the evidence was compelling, but circumstantial, and not strong enough to meet the threshold for charging the men with the Wall Street hacks. So, the agents went back to the drawing board. Nothing they subsequently learned about the men suggested they had the technical skills to pull off the entirety of last summer\u2019s complex heist of data from JPMorgan Chase. In the words of one of the people involved, these were fraudsters, not hackers. What they did discover was that several of the men may have been involved in a range of potentially criminal schemes that could benefit from data like that which was stolen from JPMorgan\u2019s data center, including the names, addresses and e-mails of tens of millions of bank customers. Among that activity was a scheme prosecutors say was masterminded by Aaron and Shalon to pump up the value of stocks that are lightly traded. One way is to promote them with large spam e-mail campaigns encouraging investors to buy, and then cashing out of their own investments before the price falls back to earth. Investigators seized on that activity. People familiar with the probe said it\u2019s a common tactic of prosecutors working such a complex case to charge suspects with some crimes that can be more easily proven and then rein in cooperating witnesses to achieve their ultimate goal. Attempts to reach lawyers for the four people arrested have so far been unsuccessful. By the time of this week\u2019s arrests, the probe was bogging down. New York-based investigators seeking the cooperation of the courts and police outside the country were making requests through 100 year-old tools like a letter rogatory, which travels at the speed of molasses through diplomatic channels. They needed to gather information from privately owned data centers in Ukraine, South Africa and other countries that the hackers used in the attack. According to two people, banks were also pressing investigators to hold someone accountable for the breach, which touched the data of more than 80 million customers. The individuals charged this week at best only get investigators part way there. The government has digital evidence and other indicators that link the JPMorgan attack to other breaches in recent years, according to several people familiar with the case. The bank may have even more insight. Security vendors employed by the bank to investigate the breach, and who asked not be identified because of the continuing investigation, attribute the hack to a well-known Russian group that is deeply involved in cybercrime that also does occasional contract work for Russian intelligence agencies. People familiar with the case say the FBI is less sure but may not have all the information gleaned by the bank. JPMorgan spokeswoman Trish Wexler declined to comment. Greg Rattray, who was hired in June 2014 as JPMorgan\u2019s chief information security officer, limited access to the attack data to control the investigation and prevent leaks, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in February. He and his boss, JPMorgan\u2019s global security chief James Cummings, a former head of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s cyber-combat unit, confounded the investigating agents so much that the Secret Service threatened to seize the evidence. Rattray was reassigned last month amid staff discord and controversy over his handling of the breach. Joseph Demarest, then assistant director of the FBI\u2019s cyber division, called Chief Operating Officer Matthew Zames to discuss delays in information-sharing, and the bank and FBI settled on what data would be handed over through a formal agreement. Demarest, who has been promoted to an FBI associate executive assistant director, issued a statement in February saying that the bank had been fully cooperative. The bank also doesn\u2019t have a full accounting of what was taken. The hackers were inside for nearly three months. JPMorgan\u2019s sophisticated system for recording all data packets flowing in and out of its networks was programmed with too little storage to retain all evidence of the intrusion, according to several people familiar with the bank\u2019s systems. Wexler, the JPMorgan spokeswoman, earlier said the bank knows all the information that was breached. It\u2019s possible the intruders may have tried to exploit the hack for other criminal schemes or sold access to the bank\u2019s network to others, one person familiar with the probe said. The arrest phase of the investigation has not gone exactly as planned, according to the people close to the case. Aaron, who lives in Tel Aviv and has evaded authorities, connects many of those charged and served as the intermediary between Shalon and unnamed conspirators in the U.S. who picked company stocks to manipulate, according to court papers and people familiar with the case. Aaron also traveled frequently to Russia, sometimes overlapping with Murgio, raising the possibility that he met with the hackers, according to the people. Authorities had hoped to arrest Aaron at his home in Tel Aviv. Officials won\u2019t say if they know where he is now. According to a social media post by his wife, they were in St. Petersburg, Russia, as recently as Sunday. (Corrects captions of first and third photographs.)

A year later, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to settle SEC claims over sales of a mortgage-related security and began reviewing its business standards. \u201cThey have established their game plan and have taken a good look at their business practices, which I helped them with, and now that project is over,\u201d Levitt said today in a telephone interview. Levitt, the longest-serving SEC chairman, often publicly defended the New York-based firm, saying in 2009 the idea that Goldman Sachs was less ethical than it had been in the past was a \u201cfiction.\u201d The next year, he said many practices in sales of mortgage bonds were industry problems not specific to the company. Still, he also said Goldman Sachs wasn\u2019t transparent in its dealings with customers before the financial crisis and said the firm should stop promoting itself as putting \u201ccustomers first\u201d because the slogan ignored tensions inherent in trading. \u201cArthur has been an invaluable resource for the past five years, particularly his work as a member of our Business Standards Committee,\u201d Jake Siewert, a spokesman for the firm, said in an e-mail. \u201cWe will miss his measured, thoughtful counsel.\u201d Levitt is a member of the board of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, and serves as a senior adviser to Promontory Financial Group LLC.

Venture capital investments topped\xa0$1 billion for the first time. People are finding it easier to invest in\xa0the digital currency, thanks to the debut of firms such as\xa0Bitcoin Investment Trust. Big financial companies\u2014Nasdaq, American Express and Visa\u2014 invested in bitcoin startups, "a game changer in terms of attitude towards the technology," said\xa0Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. So what\'s in store for 2016? We\'ll probably see the first bitcoin company valued at more than $1 billion, a self-imposed slowdown in new bitcoin production (which will\xa0put some\xa0miners out of business) and more financial institutions embracing the currency and its technology. The main unknowns are the price, consumer adoption and\u2014as always\u2014the real identity of bitcoin\'s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.1\xa0This all comes as bitcoin trades near year-highs, at around $438 on Friday. "Should be a revealing year for Bitcoin," Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who\'s bought bitcoins and invested in related\xa0startups, wrote in an e-mail.2\xa0"I expect some of the consumer applications to come to light. I expect the U.S. government to finally recognize Bitcoin as a currency. I expect to hear of the first Bitcoin unicorn (Coinbase maybe)." Here are some of\xa0the developments\xa0seen for bitcoin in 2016: New bitcoins are generated all the time, when operators of number-crunching computers called miners solve complex equations and record every transaction. The number of bitcoins that can be generated, however, is limited by design in the digital currency\'s underlying software. Once every four years, the number of bitcoins that miners can harvest every 10 minutes is cut in half. Summer 2016 marks four years since the last halving, with the\xa0cap set to drop to 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes. That\'s bad news for some miners, especially those with older machines. "They are just going gangbusters and trying to mine as much as possible," said\xa0Bobby Lee, CEO of Chinese bitcoin exchange and mining pool BTCC. With fewer new bitcoins floating around, the price of the virtual currency could climb in value, he said. Data in the bitcoin network is stored in chunks called blocks. The problem is, some worry that as more people use and buy bitcoin, the network will run into bottlenecks and dramatically slow down. Some propose changing the block size to solve the problem. "One of the most important things I\'d like to see happen is consensus from all the parties involved in bitcoin on how we should move forward," said\xa0Charlie Lee, Bobby\'s brother as well as director of engineering at Coinbase and creator of bitcoin rival Litecoin. Barry Silbert, whose company runs Bitcoin Investment Trust, recently predicted that Wall Street will begin to trade bitcoin, according to a participant\xa0at a\xa0private investor event. Traditional banks, which have long stayed away from bitcoin startups, will begin to work with these companies, he said. Financial firms will also continue to look at the blockchain, bitcoin\'s underlying technology, to use in secure transactions. While they may not directly use bitcoin, a blockchain could help verify any financial transaction, from a share trade to a bond coupon payment. R3, a startup, has gathered 30 banks including Citigroup and Bank of America to develop standards and a technology the financial institutions could use. It hopes to unveil initial results next year, said R3 spokesman Charley Cooper. At the same time, more institutional investors may\xa0start trading bitcoin. "As an ecosystem, we\'ve only just begun to scratch the surface of institutional involvement," said Tyler Winklevoss, an investor in bitcoin exchange Gemini. With hundreds of bitcoin companies vying for business, there won\'t be enough money to go around. More bitcoin startups could merge or go out of business, Silbert predicted. One cause for that will probably be the lower-than-anticipated pace of consumer bitcoin adoption. Sharp swings in the digital money\'s\xa0value against the dollar and other currencies will continue to turn off users and make bitcoin impractical for everyday\xa0purchases.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/olgakharif', 'name': u'Olga Kharif', 'twitterhandle': u'olgakharif'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-11/bitcoin-what-s-in-store-for-2016', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 11, 13, 0, 16, 590000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Bitcoin: What's in Store for 2016"}, {'articleText': u"  Taking Stock with Michael McKee and Kathleen Hays.

The company, according to a statement Tuesday, has raised $1.25 million from a group including former New York Stock Exchange chief Duncan Niederauer, former Citadel LLC executive Matt Andresen, and two co-founders of high-frequency trading firm Getco LLC, Dan Tierney and Stephen Schuler. Symbiont wants to sharply reduce the time it takes for most trades to settle, thereby reducing the need for a bank or investor to have its own money tied up in back-office operations. This use of blockchain, a ledger-like technology that underpins the digital currency called bitcoin, could give buyers and sellers almost instant confirmation their trades went through while also creating an indefinite and immutable record of the transaction. \u201cThe blockchain not only has the potential to democratize markets, but to drive down the cost of doing business across all sectors,\u201d Mark Smith, co-founder and chief executive officer of Symbiont, said in the statement. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leverage this previously unimaginable technology.\u201d Wall Street is abuzz with the potentially transformative way blockchain could overhaul derivatives, bonds, loans and other asset classes. Other firms investigating finance-related uses of blockchain include Digital Asset Holdings LLC, headed by former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker Blythe Masters; Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.; and the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cSymbiont is bridging the gap between Wall Street and the emerging blockchain ecosystem,\u201d Niederauer, once the CEO of NYSE Euronext, said in the statement. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting, timely and much-needed development for the long-term health of the markets.\u201d In March, Niederauer became an advisory director at Tera Group Inc., which last year began a bitcoin derivatives exchange and spot price index. Tierney and Schuler, who founded Getco in 1999, are invested in Symbiont through Wicklow Capital, according to the statement. Symbiont, which in biology refers to either of two organisms that live in symbiosis with each other, also got an investment from Andresen, a co-owner of quantitative trading firm Headlands Technologies LLC and former co-CEO of Citadel\u2019s market-making business.

Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. revealed Tuesday that New York-based Noble Markets, a platform for trading bitcoin, has agreed to license Nasdaq\u2019s X-stream technology. Noble is adopting the same software used by securities exchanges around the world, and a related system runs the Nasdaq Stock Market, one of the biggest equity exchanges. The news follows the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s January agreement to invest in Coinbase, another platform for trading the digital currency. Markets for buying and selling bitcoin took a reputational hit when one of the biggest, Mt. Gox, failed in 2014. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy after discovering it had lost bitcoins belonging to customers and itself. Deploying Nasdaq\u2019s software could give Noble greater legitimacy. \u201cIt is a vote of confidence in bitcoin the technology,\u201d Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex Group, said in an interview. \u201cNow that you are seeing big organizations providing technology, there\u2019s a feeling that bitcoin is here to stay.\u201d While some bitcoin startups have recently built their own trading technology, Nasdaq\u2019s system has been battle-tested for years. Nasdaq provides trading software to companies including Japan Exchange Group Inc. and Singapore Exchange Ltd., which are among the biggest market operators in the world. \u201cNasdaq is open to providing its technology to other bitcoin exchanges,\u201d Ryan Wells, a Nasdaq spokesman, said during an interview. Noble was founded by John Betts, whose resume features stints at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and UBS Group AG. Betts said his finance career included designing trading systems. His time working for the giants of finance may be a sign of maturation for bitcoin, and contrasts with Mt. Gox, which was originally envisioned as a place to buy and sell playing cards for the game Magic: The Gathering. Nasdaq\u2019s involvement is a good sign, according to Adam Draper, a venture capitalist at Boost VC who invests in bitcoin startups. It \u201cobviously shows that they think bitcoin is here to stay,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail, referring to Nasdaq.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/bitcoin-getting-serious-as-nasdaq-nyse-step-into-digital-craze', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 24, 18, 48, 21, 621000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Stock Exchanges Are Beginning to Take Bitcoin Seriously'}, {'articleText': u' It\u2019s gotten to the point where you can almost picture Savile Row tailors taking the measurements of Lloyd Blankfein and Jamie Dimon for bespoke hoodies and messenger bags. OK, maybe not. But Goldman Sachs plans to deliver its earnings to the world on Twitter this week, for Pete\u2019s sake! And JPMorgan is releasing its results AFTER the bell Tuesday, as if it\u2019s just another dot-com startup doing the conference call around a ping-pong table. Granted, JPMorgan has a good reason to release its earnings during West Coast prime time that has nothing to do with tech envy. Still, there are enough developments popping up in the news to make distinguishing Wall Street from Silicon Valley harder by the day, and not just because they\u2019re both bro cultures with an inherent love of math and a reputation for forgetting where the women are when promotion time comes around. Bankers simply have no choice but to dive headfirst into code. McKinsey & Co. estimated in a report last month that 20 percent to 60 percent of bank profits are at risk of being stolen by fintech startups or lost to margin compression in retail businesses such as consumer finance, mortgages, small-business lending, retail payments and wealth management. Remember Goldman Sachs and its seemingly endless legal battle to put a former programmer in jail for taking what was at least partially open-source trading code with him when he left? The same firm is now reportedly releasing its famous SecDb risk-management program to the masses. And banks are stumbling over each other to figure out how they can use the open-source blockchain technology developed for bitcoin. You may recall bitcoin as the playground of Anthony Murgio, who ran a cash-for-bitcoin exchange that allegedly catered to money-laundering criminals and who is linked to one of the largest bank hacks in history. While this all may be an inevitable evolution of modern banks (when was the last time you spoke with a human teller anyway?), it does open up financial firms to a whole new world of risk that even Goldman\u2019s SecDB probably can\u2019t model. Standard & Poor\u2019s said last month that Internet security is an emerging and growing threat and banks with weak cyber security could see their credit ratings downgraded even if they haven\u2019t been attacked. Imagine that: hypothetical hackers may be worse for banks than mortgage securities! So banks are going to extremes to protect their business. JPMorgan has brought in the troops, literally. The bank has hired ex-military including a former U.S. Army Chief of Staff to advise on cyber security and other issues and built a hacker-defense operation near the National Security Agency. Bank of America\u2019s CEO Brian Moynihan has said his cyber security team has more or less a blank check. Hmm, a blank check? And here we thought those were only available in Silicon Valley. Anyway, listen up for the sound of ping-pong balls during JPMorgan\u2019s conference call today. And don\u2019t forget to retweet that Goldman earnings report.

The tender is the second sale after the U.S. Marshals Service sold almost 30,000 bitcoins in June, with venture capitalist Tim Draper emerging as the sole winner. Today\u2019s auction attracted 11 bidders, the agency said, compared with 45 bidders the last time. After today\u2019s auction, the agency will still have more than 94,000 bitcoins, worth about $35 million at current prices, to sell. The price of bitcoin has declined about 38 percent since the June auction, according to CoinDesk\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index, an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. Still, the drop probably won\u2019t deter major bidders, who are bullish on the digital currency in the long term, according to Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. \u201cI do not expect the difference in price from the last auction to affect the activity -- the major bidders have been involved with bitcoin for a while and do not appear to be concerned about the current price,\u201d Luria said. \u201cEven though the market for bitcoin is becoming increasingly liquid with a growing number of venues, the ability to buy big blocks from the government is still an attractive proposition.\u201d The decline in the digital currency\u2019s value has been driven by concerns that officials from New York to Australia are considering limiting and regulating bitcoin\u2019s use. Bidding closed at 2 p.m. in New York, and the winner or winners will be notified on Dec. 5, the U.S. Marshals Service said. The auction today will again include Draper, who is bidding as a part of a syndicate created by a bitcoin startup he backs, called Mirror. Pantera Capital and a syndicate created by the trading division of SecondMarket Inc. also said they plan to participate in the auction. Winklevoss Capital, which makes bitcoin investments, will not participate in the auction, said spokeswoman Christina Mannatt Hirsch. \u201cShould be fun,\u201d Draper wrote in an e-mail. Draper, who co-founded investment firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, paid an undisclosed sum in the last auction, which attracted 45 bidders. The bitcoins he bought in June were worth about $19 million based on exchange prices at the time. Bidders who lost out in the June auction may be willing to offer higher prices this time, Michael Moro, director of SecondMarket\u2019s trading division, said in an interview. \u201cMy guess is that we\u2019ll have fewer bidders this time around because they know they won\u2019t get any bitcoins at a significant discount,\u201d Moro said. \u201cWhat you are left with are the more serious folks.\u201d The auction is part of a cache of bitcoins the FBI transferred to U.S. Marshals after shutting down Silk Road, which the U.S. said was run by Ross William Ulbricht. The marketplace was an online bazaar where anonymous users allegedly bought and sold heroin, LSD, phony passports and computer hacking services. The auctions represent a rare opportunity to secure a large amount of the virtual currency.

Billionaire Tim Draper and SecondMarket Inc. won the 80,000 bitcoins the agency auctioned off in June and December. The bitcoin\u2019s value has fallen to about $234 on Wednesday, according to the CoinDesk index, from $369 on Dec. 4, the date of the last auction, and $617 a year ago.

Investigators later determined Karpeles wasn\u2019t involved, he told jurors. Karpeles denied having anything to do with Silk Road. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, who\u2019s overseeing Ulbricht\u2019s trial, today limited the questions his lawyer can ask about the government\u2019s investigation of others they suspected of being the Silk Road operator who went by the name of \u201cDread Pirate Roberts.\u201d Ulbricht, who was arrested in a San Francisco library in October 2013, faces as long as life in prison if convicted.

Behind the alleged crimes described Tuesday is a remarkable story of unpredictable alliances in modern computer crime involving, if true, a multi-layered organization with tentacles reaching Moscow, Tel Aviv and West Palm Beach. Officials in Israel this morning picked up two men charged in the U.S. with running a multimillion-dollar stock manipulation scheme. A third person remains at large. In another case in Florida, officials arrested two men for operating an unlicensed money-transfer business using bitcoins. Though these are separate cases, some of the individuals are linked. A principal in the alleged securities-fraud scheme is a business associate of one of those charged in the Florida bitcoin operation, a friendship dating back more than a decade to their days at Florida State University. The two are also identified in a previously unreported FBI memo that connects them to the investigation of the hack of JPMorgan as well as to incidents at Fidelity Investments Ltd. and E*Trade Financial Corp. JPMorgan officials argued initially that one of the largest U.S. bank hacks in history was the work of the Russian government. None of the documents outlining the charges mention the JPMorgan hack, nor do prosecutors tie the securities fraud and money-transfer schemes to each other. However, a person familiar with the investigation said that data stolen from JPMorgan, including tens of millions of e-mails and names of customers, may have been sought for promoting stocks through a massive spam campaign. The alleged pump-and-dump scheme was several years old by the time of the Wall Street hacks. At least five stocks were manipulated in 2011 and 2012, according to the grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court. The stock fraud is described as a \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d scheme in which promotional e-mails were sent to victims, encouraging them to buy \u201chot\u201d stocks, according to a parallel complaint filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The perpetrators secretly sold their own holdings, it said, earning at least $2.8 million in illegal profits. Two Israelis and an American are charged with the fraud. Two unidentified men from New Jersey and Florida, described as co-conspirators and not charged, picked the publicly traded companies as targets for manipulation, prosecutors said. In some cases, they sought to press private companies to go public so they could be targeted. The men charged are Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, both Israeli citizens, and Joshua Samuel Aaron, a U.S. citizen who resided in both the U.S. and Israel. According to the indictment, Aaron acted as the conduit between the unnamed U.S. conspirators and Shalon, the scheme\u2019s main Israeli architect. Aaron wasn\u2019t arrested. Elements of the case apparently began to unravel this month. Investigators had hoped to arrest Aaron in Tel Aviv, where he lives with his wife, according to people familiar with the probe. Aaron and his wife were in St. Petersburg as recently as Sunday, based on social-media posts from her account. In Russia, Aaron is outside the reach of U.S. law-enforcement authorities. Investigators may have determined that he was no longer likely to return to Israel. One of Aaron\u2019s friends from his Florida State days is Anthony Murgio, a 31-year-old from West Palm Beach, Florida. Murgio is charged in a complaint also filed in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, alongside the securities complaints. Prosecutors say Murgio created a Bitcoin-exchange business in 2013 that laundered at least $1.8 million in the digital currency for tens of thousands of customers, including hackers receiving payment for \u201cransomware\u201d attacks on PCs. The documents allege that Murgio operated the exchange with an accused co-conspirator, Yuri Lebedev, under the guise of a front company, the Collectables Club Private Member Association, which lists Murgio\u2019s West Palm Beach address. Lebedev was also charged. Prosecutors allege that Murgio tried to keep Coin.mx\u2019s activities hidden and used multiple Russian payment processors to \u201cwash\u201d illicit funds. Both Murgio and Aaron traveled frequently to Russia, and a person involved in the investigation said there were links between the suspects and members of Russia\u2019s cyber underground. Though U.S. officials didn\u2019t connect the alleged criminal activities of Murgio and Aaron, the men were linked in the FBI\u2019s October memo to the hack of the three financial institutions. Bloomberg News learned their identities earlier this year but held off reporting about them at the request of the FBI, which said the information would compromise the investigation. Upon learning that Murgio and Aaron were accused of crimes, a friend from Florida State expressed dismay at the alleged schemes. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d said Bryan Ravit, a Phi Kappa Sigma brother of Murgio who lives in Winter Park, Florida. \u201cThey are very stand-up guys,\u201d Ravit said in an interview. \u201cI would trust them with my life.\u201d None of those charged with securities fraud or in the bitcoin scheme could be reached for comment. Among the surprising twists of the JPMorgan investigation is that hackers appear to have broken into the digital version of Fort Knox to steal relatively innocuous data  -- specifically e-mails of JPMorgan\u2019s customers that could be used for spam. The cybercriminals behind the JPMorgan hacks mowed through data at several major banks and brokerages, including Fidelity and E*Trade, for more than a year beginning in the fall of 2013, according to cyber-security firms and the Federal Bureau of Investigation memo. They contributed to a hodgepodge of scams, mainly securities fraud and spamming e-mails, according to one person familiar with the investigation. It\u2019s not clear if the JPMorgan hackers sought data other than the names, addresses and e-mails eventually removed from the bank\u2019s main data center. U.S. officials believe the cyberattacks were done with the help of expert hackers in Russia, according to a second person familiar with the case. One reason to target brokerage houses is to commit account-takeover fraud. Criminals steal users\u2019 logins and passwords to hijack their trading accounts and use their money to pump up the value of penny stocks and other thinly traded securities. Such schemes are often accompanied by spamming campaigns to inflate further the value of the shares. The criminals, who also own the stocks, can then cash out of the shares in their own accounts, a classic \u201cpump and dump.\u201d Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment. The bank has said that it discovered no fraud against account-holders related to the attack. Fidelity has multiple layers of security and has no indication that customer accounts or information were affected, a spokesman said. A representative for E*Trade didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Over almost three months, intruders at JPMorgan had unrestricted access to its main data center, which controls critical functions for the bank and the broader U.S. financial system. They accessed at least 100 servers and stole 40 gigabytes of data, defying the security of a company that spent $250 million to protect its computers in 2014. Sandwiched between last year\u2019s attack on Sony by North Korea and the sack of Target Corp\u2019s payment registers in late 2013, the JPMorgan breach quickly took its place in a menacing list of cyber milestones. It sparked a fight between U.S. investigators and a bank security team staffed with former Pentagon cyber warriors, who saw something darker than mere criminal behavior. The case may now become an object lesson in the complexities of tracing cyberattacks to the true culprits. In June, JPMorgan reassigned Chief Information Security Officer Greg Rattray amid staff discord over his handling of the breach. Rattray and his boss, Jim Cummings, a former head of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s cyber-combat unit, were the chief advocates of the theory that the Russian government was involved in the breach, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in February. JPMorgan declined to make Cummings and Rattray available for comment. While bank officials ran their own investigation into the massive breach, FBI officials focused early on an oddball collection of digital misfits. Murgio wrote in a personal blog that he and Aaron had operated an online marketing company with a global clientele. Murgio ran a series of unsuccessful restaurant ventures and had been previously accused of stealing $110,000 in state sales tax collected from his business customers. He received a deferred prosecution, and the charges were dropped after he paid the taxes owed to Florida. Named one of Tallahassee\u2019s top 100 singles in 2010, Murgio listed his favorite outfit as \u201creally tight jeans that I can hardly sit down in\u201d and Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d as his favorite book. After losing a long battle with the landlord of a downtown Tallahassee nightclub blocks from the Florida State University campus, Murgio, who ran the club, had a confrontation with police in October 2011 over a noise complaint. Six months later, he filed for Chapter 7 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Florida, citing $539,000 in debt. His debts persisted. On a March 2013 application for indigent status in the tax case, Murgio reported $350,000 in debt, and said his only monthly income was $1,200 in veterans benefits. Around that time, Murgio began taking frequent trips to Russia, posting videos of himself in Russian bars and with beautiful girls, one marked #Likealittleexcitedboy. On social media, friends asked why he was suddenly spending so much time in Russia. Two of the visits coincided with the computer breaches: He was in Moscow in April 2014, when Fidelity was hacked, and again in early August, when hackers were active in JPMorgan, according to his posts.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/fbi-israel-make-securities-fraud-arrests-tied-to-jpmorgan-hack', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 7, 21, 17, 50, 50, 130000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Digital Misfits Link JPMorgan Hack to Pump-and-Dump Fraud'}, {'articleText': u'  Bumitama Agri Ltd. is joining Indonesian oil-palm planters selling sukuk in Malaysia to take advantage of the nation\u2019s tax breaks and to tap its record Shariah-compliant banking assets.

Google Among Companies Examined by EU Regulators Over Taxation Google Inc. and other companies are being examined over taxation issues, European Union Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told the French senate yesterday. The EU has said it is quizzing Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on whether taxation for some companies gives them an unfair advantage. Almunia said he\u2019s close to making a decision on Google\u2019s proposal to settle an unrelated antitrust probe over alleged discrimination in its search results. He\u2019s also probing possible abuse over excluding competitors from its Android operating system. With European governments struggling to increase revenue and reduce deficits, company taxes have come under intense scrutiny. The Group of 20 nations in September endorsed the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s blueprint for cracking down on tax-avoiding strategies used by technology companies. Jefferies Agrees to Pay $25 Million in RMBS Trading Probe Jefferies Group LLC, the investment bank owned by Leucadia National Corp., agreed to pay $25 million to settle U.S. criminal and civil probes of suspected abuses in the trading of mortgage-backed securities after the financial crisis. The deal includes a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Connecticut, Jefferies said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The company will pay $11 million to counterparties harmed in certain trades, $10 million to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and $4 million to resolve a parallel investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, subject to the agency\u2019s final approval. The largest global banks lost billions of dollars on mortgage-backed debt during the financial crisis. New York-based Jefferies said the investigation \u201carose from a matter that came to light in late 2011, at which time we terminated a mortgage-backed securities trader who was then indicted\u201d in January of last year. Spokesman Richard Khaleel said the company \u201ccooperated extensively\u201d with investigators. Spokesmen for the SEC and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment. Leucadia acquired Jefferies last year.

JPMorgan-Madoff Case Won\u2019t Be Last Big One, Preet Bharara Says Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said an agreement requiring JPMorgan Chase & Co. to pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it failed to stop Bernard Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme isn\u2019t \u201cthe last big\u201d money-laundering case his office will bring.

Either way, it\u2019s been a profitable investment. Created in 2008, Bitcoin\u2019s value took off last year, leaping about 60-fold in the past 12 months to $936.51 yesterday, with prices ranging from $16 to more than $1,200, according to bitcoincharts.com. Gold plunged 26 percent in the same period, while the second best-performing major currency, the 18-nation euro, climbed 7.3 percent versus a basket of its major peers. While its supporters have embraced Bitcoin as an alternative to currencies vulnerable to sovereign debasement, China\u2019s central bank has banned lenders from handling the virtual money and Finland\u2019s authorities said it lacks the characteristics of a real currency. Citigroup Inc., the second-largest foreign-exchange trader, said Bitcoin could benefit society if it eases transactions, even though about 1 percent of owners hold some 80 percent of the digital money. \u201cBitcoin, in essence, is just an evolution of a payment system,\u201d Sebastien Galy, a New York-based senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA, said by phone Jan. 14. \u201cThe ultimate concept of transaction, the innovation, is certainly progress in the means of transaction.\u201d Bitcoin was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto, which may be a pseudonym for one or more programmers. The anonymous network is protected by cryptographic codes and works outside the banking system, allowing users to transact with one another directly. It doesn\u2019t exist in physical form and has no coins or bills. \u201cThe original Bitcoin was designed to operate outside the financial system,\u201d Steven Englander, the head of currency trading for major industrialized nations at Citigroup in New York, said by e-mail Jan. 13. \u201cThere is nothing to stop existing payments processors from adopting generic Bitcoin payments technology.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s market value has expanded to about $10.6 billion. The supply will be capped at 21 million, with about half of that already in circulation, according to Bitcoin.org, a repository for information on the system. The price of an individual Bitcoin jumped from $100 in July, to $200 in October and more than $1,000 this month. For Offit Capital Advisors LLC, this volatility could be its fatal flaw. \u201cSaying that a currency is a store of value implies that it is a relatively stable value,\u201d the New York-based private wealth-management firm wrote last month in a report. \u201cWithout that stability, the costs of normal commerce far outstrip any credit-card or bank transaction fees. Bitcoin fails miserably on this important measure.\u201d Bitcoin is less a currency than a virtual commodity, Sheng Songcheng, the head of the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s statistics department, told reporters at a briefing this week in Beijing. The Bank of Finland said on its website yesterday that the virtual money doesn\u2019t fulfill official definitions of a currency. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service hasn\u2019t offered guidance on Bitcoin beyond saying it\u2019s working on the issue and that it has been monitoring digital currencies and transactions since 2007. The IRS should give taxpayers clear rules on how it will handle transactions involving digital currencies, Nina Olson, the National Taxpayer Advocate, said Jan. 9. Bitcoin is gaining traction in the face of the official criticism. The virtual money is being accepted for donations by Texas Senate candidate Steve Stockman. Online retailer Overstock.com\u2019s Chief Executive Office Patrick Byrne said in a Jan. 9 statement that he finds the virtual currency appealing to him because \u201cno government mandarin can will it into existence.\u201d The value of the world\u2019s reserve currencies has been called into question since the 2008 financial crisis, spurring demand for everything from gold and art to digital money. The response of central banks of flooding the financial system with unprecedented amounts of cheap funding debased their currencies, helping send the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index tumbling 20 percent from March 2009 to August 2011. \u201cThere is definitely a temptation to find assets that are in limited supply,\u201d Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and former International Monetary Fund economist, said Jan. 14 in a phone interview. Investors have sought Bitcoin \u201con the belief that assets in limited supply are likely to maintain their value more than assets that can be produced at the whim of a central authority.\u201d The Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet has quadrupled to more than $4 trillion since 2008 as it sought to drive down interest rates and prop up asset prices. Japan is doubling its money supply to ward off 15 years of deflation. The European Central Bank holds 2.2 trillion euros ($3 trillion) of assets, down from a peak of 3.1 trillion euros in June 2012. As recently as 2012, ECB President Mario Draghi was forced to battle speculation that the currency union would unravel. He warned markets that July that he\u2019d do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to protect the euro, which survived to welcome Latvia as its 18th member on Jan. 1. Some companies that accept Bitcoin for payment have avoided price volatility by using a third party. Consumers can buy a $58.49 Beautyrest mattress topper from Overstock.com using the digital payment system. The payment is processed by Coinbase, which eliminates foreign-exchange risk for the retailer and provides local currency to Overstock. \u201cMost businesses that accept Bitcoin do not hold it,\u201d Citigroup\u2019s Englander said. \u201cSo they\u2019re now using it simply for transactions and not as an asset.\u201d Bitcoin the currency can\u2019t be separated from Bitcoin the payment system, Barry Silbert, the founder and head of SecondMarket Inc., a New York brokerage that runs a virtual currency fund, said Jan. 14 in a phone interview. Without having the virtual currency as an asset, the system would be reliant on trust in a third-party, he said. His fund invests in Bitcoin. \u201cThere is very little debate, I think now in Wall Street, and certainly as it relates to Silicon Valley and venture capital, that Bitcoin technology, Bitcoin the protocol, has the potential to radically disrupt and transform the financial-services space,\u201d Silbert said. Trust in traditional currencies hasn\u2019t evaporated yet, if their performance since the height of the financial crisis is anything to go by. The euro has gained 12 percent against the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes since Draghi\u2019s 2012 pledge. In the past year, it has trailed only the Swiss franc, which strengthened 7.6 percent. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 10 major counterparts, has also recovered from its decline two years ago. The gauge rose 3.5 percent in 2013, touching a three-year high of 1,056.33 in July, before climbing 1 percent this year to 1,030.76 as of 1:07 p.m. in New York. \u201cThe crisis has paradoxically shown that it\u2019s those assets that can be produced in very large quantities in a short period that are the ones that continue to retain the trust of the broad majority of investors,\u201d Cornell\u2019s Prasad said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-16/wall-street-sees-bitcoin-legacy-as-payment-system-currencies', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 16, 18, 9, 55, 626000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Wall Street Sees Bitcoin\u2019s Legacy as Payment System: Currencies'}, {'articleText': u'  The Bitcoin Foundation said the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange in Tokyo is to blame for technical faults that prevented customer withdrawals of the virtual currency that lost as much as 21 percent of its value today. \u201cThe issues that Mt. Gox has been experiencing are due to an unfortunate interaction between Mt. Gox\u2019s implementation of their highly customized wallet software, their customer support procedures and their unpreparedness,\u201d said Gavin Andresen, chief scientist for the foundation, which promotes and sets technical standards for the currency. Earlier today, Mt. Gox cited \u201ca bug in the Bitcoin software\u201d that is \u201cnot limited to Mt. Gox.\u201d The quirk enables a user to cover up a transfer to another wallet -- a software protocol for storing the virtual currency -- and re-send the same money. The exchange said it was working with the core team of software developers associated with the Bitcoin Foundation to resolve the problem. Andresen confirmed in an e-mail that Mt. Gox had been in touch with Bitcoin\u2019s core developers, while adding that \u201cthey should be able to fix this on their own.\u201d It is a problem internal to Mt. Gox, not the underlying Bitcoin concept, he said. The Bitcoin Foundation is a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that oversees the basic software protocols for the digital currency. Mark Karpeles, the chief executive of Mt. Gox, is on the foundation\u2019s board, along with Andresen. The price of Bitcoin tumbled as much as 21 percent to $535.55 today before recovering to $664.75 at 4:23 p.m. New York time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from exchanges. The index value was more than $780 before Mt. Gox announced the withdrawal halt on Feb. 7. Mt. Gox had been part of the index until today, when CoinDesk announced it had removed the exchange from the calculations. The decision by Mt. Gox to shut down Bitcoin withdrawals for at least four days -- they are still suspended - - prompted the review, according to a statement on the CoinDesk website. \u201cThese recent withdrawal restrictions are just the latest in a series of issues which have made Mt. Gox\u2019s inclusion in the BPI problematic,\u201d CoinDesk wrote. Another problem was the persistent premium, measured in dollars, paid by Mt. Gox customers over other exchanges, CoinDesk said. The ability to re-send Bitcoins means that Mt. Gox may have been defrauded by its own users, said Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer of Blockchain.info, which provides online wallets for a digital currencies. \u201cI think it\u2019s unlikely they are insolvent,\u201d Antonopoulos said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely they\u2019ve been taken for a ride by some of their clients who\u2019ve made double, triple and quadruple withdrawals.\u201d Antonopoulos said the company probably stored most Bitcoins offline to prevent theft. Nejc Kodric, the chief executive of London-based Bitstamp, another exchange, said in an e-mail Bitstamp has been unaffected by the problem Mt. Gox is reporting. Mt. Gox said customers can take out cash \u201cas normal\u201d and it\u2019s working to resolve technical issues that prompted it to halt withdrawals of the digital currency. \u201cIt\u2019s not about cash at all, only about Bitcoin,\u201d Michael Keferl, a communications officer for Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, said in an interview today. \u201cThere is a problem in the way transactions are verified.\u201d Mt. Gox customers have also complained that it can be difficult to get cash out of the exchange. U.S. authorities seized a total of $5 million from the company\u2019s accounts. The company released a statement today explaining the technical issues and saying it will resume Bitcoin withdrawals once they are addressed. \u201cWe\u2019re sending cash to people in Japan and around the world as normal. They can exchange coins into cash,\u201d Keferl said in Tokyo. The Bitcoin withdrawal issue \u201cwill be fixed.

The SEC sent a letter asking MPEx, an online exchange for Bitcoin-based trading, to provide contracts and other documents relating to SatoshiDice.com, according to a copy of the request posted on the website trilema.com. Mircea Popescu, the MPEx operator to whom the letter was addressed, confirmed its receipt in an e-mail to Bloomberg News and said MPEx hasn\u2019t broken any laws. The letter lists SatoshiDice as the topic of the inquiry without specifying what rules are at issue. Andrew Ceresney, the SEC\u2019s enforcement director, said in January the agency is \u201cvery focused\u201d on whether Bitcoin-denominated stock exchanges are illegal. U.S. laws require securities-trading platforms to be licensed.

SatoshiDice\u2019s stock is not currently among those listed on MPEx\u2019s site. Voorhees declined to comment in an e-mail, and an e-mail sent to a general mailbox at SatochiDice was unanswered. Popescu, in an Internet chat message, said the SEC didn\u2019t cite any rules that may have been broken. He asserted that U.S. securities laws don\u2019t apply to MPEx because Bitcoin doesn\u2019t fall under the legal definition of money. \u201cThere\u2019s no discussion of breaking laws,\u201d Popescu wrote. \u201cSomebody wants to propose I broke a law, they\u2019re to come up with the law I broke.\u201d Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, emerged from a 2008 paper written by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

FIS, a provider of systems used by banks to handle payments, is examining whether a public ledger like bitcoin\u2019s could help securely move funds on existing networks, Fred Brothers, the firm\u2019s chief innovation officer, said in an interview. Fiserv Inc., a provider of technology for payments and accounts, is examining bitcoin\u2019s use of encryption to ensure transfers are secure, said Marc West, a senior vice president. Such interest shows how Wall Street could seek to reap benefits touted by bitcoin\u2019s backers without using the virtual currency itself. Bitcoin, proposed by an anonymous programmer or programmers in 2008, has drawn entrepreneurs and retailers looking to popularize it as a low-cost alternative to established payment systems, supplanting credit cards to international wire transfers. Instead, a variety of financial firms might copy its underlying design to hone their own systems or services sold to clients. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that every bank is looking at what\u2019s going on with bitcoin and those types of technologies,\u201d said Steve Kenneally, a vice president at the American Bankers Association. \u201cMost of the larger banks are investigating it. The larger the banks, the further along they are.\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a March report that while bitcoins may not make a viable currency, the technology \u201ccould hold promise.\u201d The software relies on a public record of transactions. When someone spends all or part of a bitcoin, the change in ownership is recorded by a global network of computers and posted to the register, ensuring individual units can\u2019t be simultaneously held or spent by multiple people. Operators of computers solving and verifying transactions are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. Bitcoins are valued at about $435 today, compared with prices of more than $1,100 in December and about $13 at the start of last year, according to CoinDesk, which tracks prices across key exchanges. Bankers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Dimon, 58, have predicted bitcoins probably won\u2019t last after governments subject them to rules and standards akin to those for other payment systems. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not around in 10 or 20 years,\u201d Buffett, the 83-year-old billionaire chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., told CNBC in March. \u201cIt does not meet the test of a currency.\u201d Buffett\u2019s long-time business partner, Charles Munger, was less charitable this week, telling Fox Business Network that calling bitcoins \u201crat poison\u201d would understate his disdain. The technology could augment, or even replace, existing systems such as the Automated Clearing House fund-transfer system used by entities including banks, said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. Wedbush is examining the potential use of systems akin to bitcoin for interbank money transfers, said Luria, who oversees the effort. Such technologies include Ripple, a bitcoin-like system that completes transactions faster. \u201cIf there was a better solution that we felt was secure, we believe we\u2019d use that infrastructure,\u201d said Luria, who doesn\u2019t rule out that firms might use bitcoin directly. \u201cIf banks were to transact with each other in bitcoin, that would be a large opportunity.\u201d ACH handles debit and credit transfers in the U.S. Its network moved $9.8 trillion during last year\u2019s fourth quarter, according the NACHA, the electronic payments association. The system typically settles transactions within a business day, which is one reason why it can take days for money to transfer to an account. Bitcoin moves funds in minutes, while Ripple settles in seconds. The Clearing House, which operates an ACH network for companies including banks and credit unions, doesn\u2019t view bitcoin-like systems as a challenger, even if some banks could use the technology for transactions, said Dave Fortney, a senior vice president who oversees new products. Fiserv provides technology and services to more than 14,500 clients such as banks, brokerages and mortgage companies and runs a person-to-person payments service called Popmoney. The Brookfield, Wisconsin-based firm is looking at many emerging technologies, including bitcoin, and may use such concepts in its products, West said. He\u2019s interested in bitcoin\u2019s use of cryptography -- a mix of mathematics and computer science to verify transactions quickly. Companies are also sprouting up to help financial firms handle bitcoins. Vaurum, a Palo Alto, California-based startup that enables companies including banks and brokerages to trade and store bitcoins on behalf of customers, said in a statement today that it raised $4 million in seed funding from investors including Battery Ventures, America Online Inc. co-founder Steve Case and Timothy Draper, co-founder of investment firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Regulators around the world have expressed concern that bitcoins may be used to finance terrorism, trade in illicit merchandise or launder money. That reputation makes banks reluctant to use the digital currency directly, said Cary Whaley, a vice president at the Independent Community Bankers of America. While virtually none of the group\u2019s members are interested in using the digital money, a small number are examining its concepts, he said. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll adopt it, he said. \u201cWhat banks are looking at is updating the technology they already have -- using the rails that they have in a more efficient, faster manner through modifying existing payment systems,\u201d Whaley said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-07/bitcoin-breakthroughs-seen-copied-by-banks-it-s-meant-to-replace', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 5, 7, 12, 1, 1, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Breakthroughs Seen Copied by Banks It\u2019s Meant to Replace'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-10-06/the-future-of-finance-blockchain-in-the-banking-industry', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-01-28/yahoo-to-spin-off-alibaba-stake-tax-free', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-10-02/bill-gates-bitcoin-is-exciting-because-its-cheap', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-10-06/gold-and-bitcoin-stay-below-levels', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u'  The price of Bitcoins recovered after the virtual currency lost a third of its value, triggered by the arrest of the operator of an online marketplace for drugs and illicit goods. One unit of the digital money was trading for about $117 on the Bitstamp Ltd. exchange as of 7:30 p.m. in New York. Bitcoin touched a low of $85 yesterday after charges against Ross William Ulbricht, who runs the \u201cSilk Road Hidden Website,\u201d were unsealed. He was charged in federal court in New York for running a \u201csprawling black-market bazaar\u201d where anonymous users bought and sold illegal drugs and phony identification documents using Bitcoins. Before that, they were worth around $127 on the market. The virtual currency exists as software that\u2019s designed to be untraceable, making it an attractive tender for those seeking to trade anonymously via the Web. While yesterday\u2019s plunge in value was probably due to speculation that demand for the digital money will shrink after the U.S. government seized the Silk Road website, the rebound indicates that there\u2019s still plenty of demand for Bitcoins outside Silk Road, according to Richard Bove, vice president of equity research at Rafferty Capital Markets LLC. \u201cThat\u2019s the most fascinating thing with Bitcoin: You can sit there and list 150 things that are wrong with it, but it meets a need,\u201d Bove said in an interview. \u201cIf you are an Argentinian with high rate of inflation, you need Bitcoins. If you are worried about the sequester and the shutdown of the government, you might need it. They are meeting a need for a large number of people somewhere.\u201d Since being introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become popular way to pay for goods and services on the Internet, with 11.8 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks the digital currency\u2019s activity. New Bitcoins can only be created by solving complex problems embedded in the currency, which requires greater computing power as more of the money is \u201cminted.\u201d Since that limits the number of Bitcoins, their value will be propped up, Bove said. \u201cI think over time, the direction will be up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt defies all logic, but for many users, it works.\u201d While Bitcoins are designed to be untraceable, that\u2019s not always guaranteed since most transactions leave a record of the exchange. Although the currency can be used for illicit goods, it\u2019s also becoming a popular way to buy and sell legitimate products and services, from cupcakes to Web hosting. Bitstamp and several other online exchanges have emerged where Bitcoin holders are able to trade the digital currency for dollars, euros and other legal tender. With the growing use of Bitcoins, driven in part by speculative demand, the currency is up about tenfold over the last year, according to Bitcoincharts. Still, there\u2019s uncertainty over the currency\u2019s future as regulators and law enforcement agencies look at its uses. U.S. prosecutors said yesterday that Ulbricht, known on Silk Road as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d ran the site as \u201cthe most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet\u201d from January 2011 to September 2013. The site generated sales of about $1.2 billion and about $80 million in commissions for Silk Road, they said. Ulbricht, 29, was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. He tried to have one user killed for attempting to extort money from the site, prosecutors said in a criminal complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court. Ulbricht appeared in federal court in San Francisco yesterday, according to Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The criminal case is U.S. v.

Rodrigo Batista, president of online brokerage Mercado Bitcoin, said trading volume climbed to 10.5 million reais ($4.4 million) in December from almost zero a year before, growth he attributed in part to the real\u2019s selloff. Brazil\u2019s real has plunged 9.6 percent in the past three months against the dollar, making it difficult for policy makers to curb inflation despite the world\u2019s biggest borrowing-cost increases. Inflation that accelerated to 5.91 percent in 2013, even after central bank President Alexandre Tombini said it would slow, is adding to Brazilians\u2019 interest in bitcoin, a virtual currency that surged to $1,005 last week on trading platform Mt Gox, up from $15 about a year ago. \u201cFear of inflation is a determining factor for some people to take risks on Bitcoin here,\u201d Batista, a former program developer for Morgan Stanley in Brazil, said in a Jan. 22 interview in Sao Paulo. \u201cThere are no good investments here with inflation at 6 percent plus high tax rates. If the real continues to weaken a lot, it will also continue to benefit the market.\u201d Batista anticipates that volume on Mercado Bitcoin will surge to about 160 million reais a month in 2014 to rival trading volume in Germany. Batista and two partners bought the brokerage from a software developer in April. The exchange, which now has six employees, makes an average of about 2.5 percent on transactions, he said. Bitcoin has had a mixed reception in emerging markets, as authorities seek to protect consumers and businesses from potential losses. China\u2019s central bank has banned lenders from handling Bitcoin and the Reserve Bank of India warned virtual currency traders of legal risks. Brazil\u2019s central bank said it isn\u2019t regulating Bitcoin for now under a law on payment methods because the virtual currency isn\u2019t significant enough to be of \u201csystemic importance,\u201d according to an e-mailed response to questions Jan. 22. The real\u2019s 28 percent plunge in the past two years is the biggest among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the South African rand. Fiscal deterioration under President Dilma Rousseff is fueling bets on a credit-rating cut, and Brazil also has the highest tax rate among major emerging markets, according to the World Bank. Most buyers in Brazil are interested in Bitcoin as an investment, Batista said. Brazilian businesses from sex shops to hotels accepting the currency are signs that the central bank\u2019s neutral stance is a boon to the market, he said. Clients include investors from neighboring Argentina with Brazilian roots, who are drawn to Bitcoin to avoid capital controls and a depreciating peso. Volatility is a concern for Bitcoin buyers, Batista said. The digital currency reached a record $1,242 in November, and fell to less than half that price a few days later. \u201cPeople are looking at this as a risky new asset with potential for big gains, like a binary assets in which you either get a big pay-out or zero,\u201d he said. \u201cThey put in money that they\u2019re comfortable with losing.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-27/bitcoin-seen-as-save-haven-in-brazil-boosts-online-trade', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 27, 16, 6, 55, 878000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Seen as Save Haven in Brazil Boosts Online Trade'}, {'articleText': u'  The U.S. Secret Service is investigating reports that Mitt Romney\u2019s tax returns have been stolen from an accounting firm and are being held for ransom.

The trust will allow \u201csophisticated investors\u201d to buy shares at a set price without having to transact Bitcoin in a fragmented and highly illiquid market with unregulated entities, and safely store the virtual money, according to the trust\u2019s website. Since its creation in 2009, Bitcoin\u2019s market value has risen to $1.5 billion, 24 million transactions have been conducted, and more than 10,000 vendors now accept the virtual money, according to the statement. \u201cWe incubated the BIT to alleviate the problems of direct bitcoin ownership, including having to wire money to newly-established and potentially unregulated entities around the world,\u201d SecondMarket Chief Executive Officer Barry Silbert said in the statement. The trust requires a minimum investment sum of $25,000, the website showed. Investors who buy shares in the trust can gain liquidity through auctions on SecondMarket starting in 2014, according to the statement. The net asset value of the trust will be calculated daily and made publicly available, it said. Bitcoin was created by a person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto and can be used to buy and sell a variety of items ranging from cupcakes to electronics to illegal narcotics. The currency is derived through a system called mining, in which connected computers process Bitcoin transactions and earn their owners Bitcoin as a reward. The potential difficulty in tracking illegal transactions has drawn regulatory attention. The trust will be audited by Ernst & Young LLP, according to the statement.

It\u2019s also exacerbating the fastest drain on the nation\u2019s dollar reserves in a decade, sparking a government clampdown as it tries to preserve the primary source of cash for creditor payments. Argentines who buy a car valued at more than 350,000 pesos ($58,600) will now be required to justify the transaction with the Financial Information Unit, the nation\u2019s money-laundering watchdog, according to a Nov. 11 decree. Argentina, whose reserves dropped below those of Angola, Lebanon and Romania this year, is boosting its currency controls as consumers faced with 25 percent annual inflation turn to everything from luxury cars to gold and bitcoins as a store of savings. Surging demand for premium models from Volkswagen AG\u2019s Porsche and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG is fueling a 33 percent jump in automobile imports this year. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the government is keeping an eye on luxury cars because sales are rising at very high rates while the economy loses foreign currency,\u201d Gonzalo Dalmasso, vehicle industry analyst at research company Abeceb.com, said by telephone from Buenos Aires. \u201cIt won\u2019t make a big change, but at this point the objective is just to contain the situation.\u201d To lock in the discount, Argentines sell dollars in the black market, where the U.S. currency fetches 9.8 pesos, and use the proceeds to buy vehicles imported at the official exchange rate of 5.9762. As the gap between the two rates has swelled over the past two years, the number of Argentines seeking to exploit it by buying imported vehicles has grown, Dalmasso said. The government measure is aimed at discouraging these buyers by forcing them to disclose information including bank account details and tax returns, he said. Car imports accounted for 9.2 percent of the total $56.3 billion of imports as of September, up from 7.7 percent in the same period last year, according to the latest data from the National Statistics and Census Institute. Dealers sold 87,014 cars in October, 24 percent more than a year ago and a record for the month, according to the country\u2019s dealer association, Acara. Sales are headed to a record 930,000 this year, the Nov. 4 report said. Imported cars accounted for 60 percent of sales. Sales of luxury cars are rising the most this year, with purchases of Tata Motors Ltd.\u2019s Land Rover brand jumping 170 percent, the biggest increase out of the 40 brands in the Acara report. Alfa Romeo, BMW and Porsche were next, with gains in sales of 139 percent, 96 percent and 76 percent, respectively. \u201cIt\u2019s been our best year in a long time,\u201d said Martin Gerona, a sales executive at a BMW dealership in Avenida del Libertador in Buenos Aires. \u201cPeople come in with their minds set on buying. They don\u2019t think about it too much. They just come and leave with a new car because it\u2019s become a very good deal with the gap in the exchange rates.\u201d BMW dealers sold 390 cars in October and 3,699 this year through October. For would-be Porsche enthusiasts, the 911 Carrera S costs about 1.4 million pesos in Buenos Aires, or $234,000 at the official exchange rate. A prospective buyer can purchase the same car by exchanging just $143,000 in the black market, resulting in a 39 percent discount. The most expensive 911 Carrera S listed on New Country Porsche of Greenwich, Connecticut, costs $124,365, according to the dealership\u2019s website. The surging demand for imported cars, along with an increase in energy imports and spending by Argentine tourists abroad, contributed to a $10.6 billion drop in reserves this year, the fastest rate since 2002, a year after Argentina defaulted on $95 billion of debt. The current level of $32.7 billion is the lowest since January 2007. The government had sought to compensate dollar demand from car importers by forcing companies to export national products. This prompted Porsche to ship wine, Mitsubishi Motor Corp. to export peanuts and imported Subarus were matched by sales of chicken feed to Chile. While the latest measure will probably cause sales to slow, it won\u2019t be enough to contain the fall in reserves, according to Camilo Tiscornia, a former economist at the central bank who currently runs C&T Asesores Economicos in Buenos Aires. \u201cThe boom will cool a bit because it\u2019ll make the process more bureaucratic and people who are going to the black market may find it hard to justify where they got the funds,\u201d Tiscornia said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut this alone won\u2019t be enough to contain dollar outflows.\u201d Argentina started using reserves to pay debt in 2010 and plans to draw $8 billion of the funds through the end of the year. Its borrowing costs of 11.2 percent are almost double the average for emerging markets, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. South America\u2019s second-biggest economy still has almost five times the dollars it needs to pay $6.8 billion of principal and interest due on its foreign currency government bonds next year, according to Economy Ministry data. While Argentines see investing in cars as a good alternative to holding pesos that have weakened 20 percent in the last year, luxury models are especially attractive. Unlike cheaper options built locally or in the Mercosur trade block, BMWs and Porsches are imported with prices set at the official rate, making them relatively cheaper, Dalmasso said. Cars tend to drop about 15 to 20 percent when driven off the lot and then appreciate at about 18 percent a year due to inflation, according to an Abeceb.com. In comparison, the benchmark deposit rate, or what banks pay on 30-day deposits of more than 1 million pesos, was 19.19 percent on Nov. 11. \u201cIn Argentina, used-car prices increase, which might seem strange to countries with no double-digit inflation,\u201d Dalmasso said. \u201cYou won\u2019t make money with a car but you\u2019ll hedge against inflation and at least it\u2019ll be more enjoyable than keeping the money in the bank.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-13/porsche-911s-at-39-off-spurs-argentina-crackdown-on-peso', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 13, 20, 27, 43, 146000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Porsche 911s at 39% Off Sparks Argentina Sales Crackdown'}, {'articleText': u'  New York\u2019s top banking overseer said any regulation of the nascent Bitcoin industry has to include transparency on who does the trading of the virtual currency, and if that hurts a business dominated by anonymous transactions, \u201cso be it.\u201d Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, said he doesn\u2019t have an opinion about the viability of Bitcoin as a digital currency. In an interview with Bloomberg editors and reporters, he said his primary concern involved adding anti-money-laundering safeguards. Lawsky said his goal in sending out subpoenas to almost two dozen digital currency companies this summer was not to \u201csquelch out\u201d the fledgling industry; it was to make sure the proper know-your-customer guidelines were in place. \u201cVirtual currencies may ultimately turn out to be a very big thing that people want to use,\u201d Lawsky said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \u201cRight now, it feels as if the major advantage they\u2019re providing is anonymity. We\u2019ve learned over the years that if you see huge international transactions over the Internet, anonymous, it can often become a haven for money launderers, terrorists.\u201d In starting his investigation into the payment practices of the virtual currency industry, Lawsky inserted himself into a discussion among national regulators about appropriate disclosure practices for Bitcoin and similar digital products. In August, members of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group, met with members of the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and other regulatory officials to discuss the digital currency. If people are using Bitcoin for legitimate financial transactions, transparency rules won\u2019t harm the industry, Lawsky said in the Bloomberg meeting. Lawsky, 43, sent subpoenas to startup companies in the virtual currency industry in August, asking for specific information about how the industry could monitor the transactions taking place. \u201cWe as regulators need to have protections in place,\u201d Lawsky said. \u201cWe need to make sure records are being created. If you don\u2019t, it becomes a real haven for these anonymous transactions, where you have terrorists, narco-traffickers engaging in actions that prosecutors someday could never find out about.\u201d In the two years since he became superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, formed when Governor Andrew Cuomo combined the departments of banking and insurance, Lawsky is best known for threatening to pull the banking license of Standard Chartered Plc for violating statutes related to dollar-clearing transactions for Iranian clients.

The digital money, which can be used to pay for goods and services on the Internet, has risen 20-fold so far this year, as trading activity has increased. Bitcoins were trading at $251.36 apiece at 6:30 p.m. in New York on BitStamp, one of the more active Web-based exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars, euros and other currencies. The rally comes a month after the closing of the \u201cSilk Road Hidden Website,\u201d where people could obtain drugs, guns and other illicit goods using Bitcoins. The virtual currency lost a third of its value in the days after the website was shut down. Bitcoins are becoming increasingly popular, particularly in China, said Ugo Egbunike, director of business development at IndexUniverse, an index-fund researcher. \u201cI thought Silk Road is going to do some damage to the price,\u201d Egbunike said. \u201cBut with BTC China buying this up -- they seem to have picked up the slack.\u201d BTC China is now the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, Nicholas Colas, a ConvergEx Group analyst, wrote in a Nov. 5 report. The virtual currency exists as software that\u2019s designed to be untraceable, making it an attractive tender for those seeking to trade anonymously via the Web. There are about 30 transactions per minute, at an average amount of 16 Bitcoins, according to a report today by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Since being introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is being used to pay for everything from cupcakes to electronics on the Internet, with almost 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks the digital money\u2019s activity. Bitcoin\u2019s previous record was $259.34 on BitStamp in April. The virtual currency was also trading for $263 apiece on Mt. Gox, another online exchange, today. \u201cIf James Bond, Sergey Brin and Paul Volcker all got together and designed their ideal currency, it might look a lot like Bitcoin,\u201d Colas wrote in the note.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-06/bitcoin-climbs-to-record-on-wider-acceptance-china-trade', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 6, 23, 38, 50, 416000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Climbs to Record on Wider Acceptance, China Trade'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin is making an art critic out of the Swedish taxman. The largest Nordic economy is set to reject Bitcoin and its competitors as a currency and instead give the software the same tax treatment it would an antique Persian rug or a painting by Andy Warhol. \u201cCurrencies are traditionally tied to a central bank or a geographic area,\u201d Olof Wallin, an official at the Swedish Tax Agency who\u2019s drafting rules for Bitcoin and the programmers who generate it, said in an interview. The Stockholm-based agency will probably \u201cview Bitcoins as what we call another asset -- just like art or antiques.\u201d Since its 2008 creation, Bitcoin has challenged assumptions of what money is. It\u2019s also captured the attention of regulators, who are struggling to keep up as people use the software to pay for everything from university tuition to cups of coffee to senate campaign donations. Sweden is leaning toward an interpretation of Bitcoin that will allow the nation to charge capital gains taxes on any transactions using the software. The move would place Bitcoin in an asset class that includes antiques, jewelry, stamps and copyrights. Across the Nordic region, where stable AAA governments have been at the forefront in tightening bank regulation, authorities are grappling with the concept of Bitcoin. In Norway, the tax department has decided to label it a taxable asset. Finland plans to treat it as a commodity while Danish regulators are drafting a proposal for lawmakers in an effort to protect consumers and businesses from losses. Sweden\u2019s central bank raised concerns in June that Bitcoin and its competitors may pose risks to those using it as a payment method. The European Banking Authority echoed those concerns in December, warning that people using the software do so at their own risk. This month Sweden\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchange, Kapiton, was reported to the police and the National Board for Consumer Disputes after a number of users alleged their money had disappeared. Kapiton\u2019s founder -- referred to on the website only as Sebastian -- published a statement on Jan. 18 apologizing for \u201crecent problems\u201d and assuring users that no client assets had disappeared. The site is working to match orders with accounts, Sebastian said. Financial Markets Minister Peter Norman said this week virtual currencies risk becoming tools for criminal activity such as money laundering and the financing of terrorism. \u201cIf we end up with artificial or virtual currencies, there is a risk that they could slip through the cracks and that would be serious,\u201d Norman said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think Bitcoins are at that stage today, but if they were to grow into a big virtual currency that\u2019s being used a lot, that would result in risks that we don\u2019t want.\u201d Globally, Bitcoin has had a mixed reception. China\u2019s central bank banned lenders from handling the virtual money while the U.S. Internal Revenue Service hasn\u2019t offered guidance beyond saying it\u2019s working on the issue and that it has been monitoring digital currencies since 2007. Almost half of international investors are bearish on Bitcoin, with 47 percent of respondents in a Bloomberg Global Poll published today saying they would sell Bitcoin. Some 11 percent of respondents would buy the virtual currency while another 7 percent said they would hold it, with the rest of respondents saying they didn\u2019t have an opinion. Entrepreneurs are looking at using Bitcoin payment technology to undercut the billions in fees reaped by companies such as Visa Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. from the use of credit and debit cards. The price of Bitcoins soared in November, topping $1,000 for the first time, as speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. The price dropped to $805.1 today on Bitstamp, one of the more active online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars and other currencies. One Bitcoin cost about $15 a year ago. Bitcoin, which first appeared the same year Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed, was created by a programmer, or a group of programmers, going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. There are 21\xa0million possible Bitcoins that can be mined by a peer-to-peer network harnessing computers to complete complicated mathematical calculations. About 12.2 million units are currently in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts.com. Swedish tax authorities are also looking into how to treat Bitcoin miners -- programmers who unlock new Bitcoins by using ever-faster computers to solve complex mathematical problems. Wallin said the question is whether they should be taxed as businesses, a classification that would allow them to deduct some equipment from taxes. The challenge remains tracking a new market whose size and scope can be hard to gauge, even for regulators. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are that many,\u201d Wallin said. \u201cBut they have been calling us for answers.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-21/bitcoin-becomes-art-as-swedish-taxman-rejects-creative-currency', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 22, 13, 45, 13, 198000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Turns Into Art as Sweden Rejects Creative Currency'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin\u2019s price may be stabilizing as the virtual currency becomes more widely used and adoption by merchants accelerates, brokerage ConvergEx Group LLC said. The digital money, which rose to $1,000 last year from about $13 at the beginning of 2013, is on the road to stability now, according to Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx in New York. Bitcoin\u2019s price rose 6.2 percent in the last month to $794 on Bitstamp, one of the more active online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars and other currencies. More merchants are starting to accept Bitcoins, which can be used to buy everything from gummy bears to cars. Electronics-retailer TigerDirect Inc. said yesterday that consumers will be able to use Bitcoin to buy more than 200,000 products on the site. Online-retailer Overstock.com Inc. and social-games developer Zynga Inc. now accept Bitcoins as well. Lower volatility is critical if Bitcoin is to be used widely in online and offline retail transactions, Colas said. \u201cWe have no doubt that merchants will adopt Bitcoin simply to access newly minted high net worth individuals,\u201d Colas said in the note. \u201cBut to keep them in the fold and increase the usage of Bitcoin in other parts of their business, they will need to see some greater stability in the price.\u201d Bitcoins exist as software, which contains the rules governing their supply and can only be created by solving complex problems embedded in the currency, keeping total growth limited.

Apple requires apps to be legal everywhere they\u2019re offered, and some governments including China and India have questioned Bitcoin\u2019s legal status. The ouster of Blockchain is causing a backlash, and some are going to extreme measures to show their displeasure. Several people posted videos online destroying their iPhones. One user shot his iPhone with a sniper rifle, another smashed it with a metal bar and another threw it down a flight of stairs. Bitcoins exist only as software, and transactions are completed via computing devices. Even though no physical currency exists, merchants from car dealers and Web stores are accepting the digital money. Mobile apps such as Coinbase, which was removed from the App Store last year, and Blockchain have become a popular way to make payments. Blockchain had been downloaded 120,000 times before being removed. Apple has already shut out several other applications that facilitate digital-money payments from its online store. \u201cApple has been acting to suppress Bitcoin apps for years,\u201d said Rob Banagale, the CEO of Gliph Inc., a Bitcoin app that Apple allowed to remain in the store only after the ability to send and receive Bitcoins was removed. \u201cFew consumers are using Bitcoin actively yet, including Apple customers,\u201d Banagale said. Since removing the apps \u201caffects only a tiny fraction of their customer base, it isn\u2019t worth having Bitcoin as an additional consideration for the company to worry about regulatory oversight,\u201d he said. Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment. Backers of Bitcoin, including the venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, see it as an alternative to the global-payment system currently dominated by companies including Visa Inc., Western Union Co. and large banks. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz. Early adopters of Bitcoin technology, many versed in cryptography, saw it as a way to thwart government control of currencies. Jerry Brito, director of the technology program at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, said Apple probably banned Blockchain due to concerns that Bitcoin transaction apps would run afoul of the law. \u201cApple removing Bitcoin apps is stupid, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s doing it to thwart competition,\u201d Brito said. \u201cBut it\u2019s so opaque, people will speculate.\u201d Apple curates its App Store by approving every game, productivity tool, news-reading and social-network app before it can be downloaded by customers. That contrasts with Google Inc., which has a more open approach that allows software developers to post their wares more freely. The App Store is a big business. Apple said in January that the digital storefront was available to users in 155 countries and had sales of more than $10 billion in 2013. Currently, all transactions made in the App Store are facilitated by Apple, which has more than 400 million credit cards on file for the store. The company also is exploring expanding its payments system to allow iPhones to be used to make purchases of physical goods at stores, a person familiar with the plans said last month. Andreas Antonopoulos, who joined Blockchain last month as chief security officer, isn\u2019t buying the legal theory. App upgrades go through a payments system that Apple controls and profits from, as do subscriptions, so Apple \u201cdoes already compete with Bitcoin\u201d through the App Store, he said. Antonopoulos predicted that Apple\u2019s move would drive developers to create more websites that are accessed through a smartphone\u2019s browser, bypassing the App Store altogether. Recent workarounds in HTML5, a software protocol, have enabled browser-based apps to link up with smartphone cameras. Many Bitcoin-related programs need to capture QR digital codes to complete transactions. \u201cWe\u2019re working on an application that would do all the very same things, for any mobile device at all,\u201d Antonopoulos said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-07/apple-bitcoin-rift-has-currency-s-fans-ditching-iphones', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 7, 5, 1, 0, 9000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Apple-Bitcoin Rift Has Currency\u2019s Fans Ditching IPhones'}, {'articleText': u'  Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s chief executive officer, is wrong to predict that regulation will end the digital currency business, said a lawyer for a group that lobbies for the Bitcoin business. \u201cThat just shows he doesn\u2019t understand it,\u201d the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s lawyer, Patrick Murck, told Bloomberg Television\u2019s Emily Chang today. \u201cIt can be useful and fit into the current regulatory environment at a much lower fee structure than the credit card industry and traditional payment methods.\u201d Dimon, who runs the largest U.S. bank, said in a Jan. 23 interview on CNBC that Bitcoin \u201cwill eventually be made as a payment system, I think, to follow the same standards as the other payment systems, and that will probably be the end of them.\u201d The Bitcoin market is being targeted by regulators.

The case is the latest to be brought by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara\u2019s office stemming from a probe of Silk Road, a black market bazaar. Shrem intends to plead not guilty when he\u2019s arraigned in two weeks before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan, according to his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo. David Braun, a laywer for Faiella, declined to comment on his client\u2019s case. The case is U.S. v. Faiella, 14-cr-00243, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Ex-Direct Access Officers Charged in Venezuelan Bribe Scheme The former chief executive officer of Direct Access Partners LLC and a former partner at the New York-based broker-dealer were charged with operating a bribery scheme involving Venezuela\u2019s state bank. Benito Chinea, the former CEO, and Joseph DeMeneses were charged with conspiracy, money laundering and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Travel Act, in a 15-count indictment unsealed yesterday in Manhattan federal court. The two men pleaded not guilty and were each released on $1 million bond. Chinea and DeMeneses are accused of paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez de Hernandez, a vice president of finance at Banco de Desarrollo Economico y Social de Venezuela, in exchange for the bank\u2019s bond-trading business. Direct Access former Senior Vice President Tomas Alberto Clarke Bethancourt and Ernesto Lujan, a former managing partner, pleaded guilty in the scheme in August. Both agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in a bid for leniency when they\u2019re sentenced. Gonzalez pleaded guilty in November. She\u2019s also cooperating with the government. The case is U.S. v. Chinea, 14-cr-00240, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Wells Fargo Securities Lending Suit Settled on Eve of Trial Wells Fargo & Co. settled a lawsuit over claims it mismanaged institutional investors\u2019 collateral received as part of its securities lending program, lawyers for both sides told a judge as a trial was close to starting. Three union retirement plans sued the lender in 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to start yesterday in St. Paul, Minnesota, when the attorneys instead announced publicly before U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank that they\u2019d reached an accord. The terms weren\u2019t disclosed. The trial would have been the third for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo over its program of temporarily lending an institutional investor\u2019s holdings to a third party in exchange for collateral that the bank invests with the objective of producing a profit for its client. The bank lost a $30.1 million jury verdict in 2010 then won a trial over an $8.2 million claim last year. Frank scheduled a June 5 hearing at which the parties will present a detailed settlement proposal to him for preliminary approval. The case is City of Farmington Hills Employees Retirement System v.

So it makes sense that the value of Bitcoin would fall off a cliff as news broke that the FBI had arrested a man suspected of running the most famous online black market. The value of Bitcoin dropped to about $110 by early Wednesday afternoon, down from $140 earlier this morning. But people in the more legitimate corners of the Bitcoin world believe the apparent demise of Silk Road is the best thing that could happen to the currency. \u201cI think it\u2019s a huge positive,\u201d says Fred\xa0Ehrsam, the co-founder of Bitcoin startup Coinbase. \u201cThis kind of takes the biggest target that people might speak negatively about when it comes to Bitcoin, and takes it off the map.\u201d According to a recently unsealed FBI complaint, Ross William Ulbricht had been running Silk Road from January 2011 until agents tracked him down in a San Francisco apartment this summer. Ulbricht named himself the Dread Pirate Roberts, after the character in The Princess Bride, and the FBI complaint describes his alleged role overseeing a small staff that kept the network running. Earlier this year he paid for the murder of someone who was threatening to release the names of thousands of Silk Road users, according to the complaint, and Ulbricht is quoted through correspondence suggesting the murder actually happened (although the FBI could find no evidence). All economic activity on Silk Road was conducted in Bitcoins, a digital currency designed to obscure the identities of the people using it. Silk Road users could also access the service only through Tor, a tool for anonymous web use. Silk Road facilitated transactions totaling 9.5 million Bitcoins since January 2011, taking in more than 600,000 Bitcoins in commissions in the process\u2014valued by the FBI, using recent prices, at $80 million in commissions on $1.2 billion in sales. This probably overstates the actual level of transactions, however, given the huge increase and wild fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s value over that time. Ulbricht\u2019s arrest led to one such swing. On Wednesday the price of Bitcoin on Mt. Gox, the largest exchange where users can convert it into more traditional currencies, quickly dropped about 20 percent. But Bitcoin quickly worked its way back up, regaining more than half its losses in the afternoon. Just after 4 p.m., it was trading at about $127. The presumed end of Silk Road is a big test for Bitcoin, says Jerry Brito,\xa0director of the technology research program at Mercatus Center at George Mason University, who has studied the currency. If its appeal doesn\u2019t extend beyond a way to hide your identity in online drug transactions, then this could mark the end of its run and the value should drop accordingly. But Brito and other proponents see Bitcoin primarily as a way to lower the transaction costs associated with legitimate online commerce. If the market quickly recovers, it bolsters their argument by showing that demand won\u2019t drop off once the best way to buy cocaine with Bitcoin disappears. The fact that Silk Road, for all the attention paid to it, accounted for only about 4 percent of the overall Bitcoin trade suggests that the market will do just fine. The FBI\u2019s ability to bust Ulbricht doesn\u2019t so far seem to have undermined the reputation of Bitcoin as a haven of anonymity, another rationale for its use even on legal purchases. There is nothing in the FBI\u2019s complaint to suggest that agents exploited a weakness in the currency\u2019s secure code during the Silk Road investigation. Instead, the FBI said it gained access to computer servers used by the black market and tracked Ulbricht through forensic analysis of those machines. (Still, whether Bitcoin is truly anonymous is increasingly\xa0coming into question.) If the government can catch Bitcoin-using criminals without compromising the currency itself, that should dampen the impression that there is something uniquely nefarious about it, and Brito suggests that could give Bitcoin a leg up with skeptical banking regulators. \u201cWe can see from the Silk Road seizure that the system works and that law enforcement can address this,\u201d says Brito. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing special about Bitcoin.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-02/silk-roads-demise-sinks-bitcoin-value-and-saves-bitcoins-reputation', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 10, 3, 14, 41, 55, 479000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"The End of the Internet's Biggest Black Market Is Good for Bitcoin"}, {'articleText': u' Since Sunday, a trio of Bitcoin apps have soared up Spain\u2019s download charts, coinciding with news that cash-strapped Cyprus was planning to raid domestic savings accounts to pay off a $13 billion bailout tab.

That no longer seems necessarily true. GHash.IO,\xa0a particularly powerful organization of Bitcoin miners, turns out to have at times controlled more than half of all Bitcoin mining activity\u2014a development that some think poses a new threat to the system. The creation of new Bitcoins has increasingly become the preserve of sprawling groups known as mining pools. GHash.IO, the most successful of these pools, theoretically has enough power to cheat the system.\xa0The details are complicated, but it basically functions like this: The Bitcoin system works only if users guarantee that coins aren\u2019t spent twice. This requires a good deal of computational power, so the system rewards users who verify blocks of transactions by awarding them new Bitcoins. The process is known as mining. Just like miners looking for gold, Bitcoin verifiers don\u2019t know exactly where the rewards will be, but every once in a while, Bitcoin miners involved in verifying blocks of transactions will unlock a reward. They announce it, and everyone moves to the next block. The supposed vulnerability comes when miners don\u2019t tell everyone else when they\u2019ve completed work on one block. So-called selfish miners could theoretically keep their success a secret to get a head start on the next block. This could allow them to double-spend transactions, trading Bitcoins for dollars, erasing the record of the transaction and getting their Bitcoins back. This isn\u2019t a new idea. Last November two researchers from Cornell University, Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer, described such a scheme and concluded that Bitcoin was broken\u2014\u201cnot just superficially so, but fundamentally.\u201d At the time, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, essentially dismissed the concerns. He sounded less sanguine on Friday, when he said that power over Bitcoin mining is centralized in too few hands, and urged people to stop working with GHash.IO. The bottom hasn\u2019t fallen out of Bitcoin, but people are taking this seriously. Peter Todd, a designer for a Bitcoin miner, wrote on Reddit that he was selling half his Bitcoins. He floated a few solutions\u2014including writing code that would get rid of pools like GHash.IO altogether. But he\u2019s skeptical that a sufficiently drastic solution can happen without a serious Bitcoin failure. \u201cIf that failure happens it\u2019s quite likely that the Bitcoin price will drop to essentially nothing\u2014not a good way to start a few months of work fixing the problem when my expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars,\u201d he wrote. Andresen is more optimistic, saying there are practical problems that GHash.IO would run into if it tried something like this. Namely, it would get caught. Such misbehavior is \u201cextremely unlikely from an economically rationally mining pool,\u201d he said. In an interview with Cryptocoin News, Ghash.IO\u2019s chief information officer, Jeffrey Smith, promised not to do anything untoward: \u201cWe would never do anything to harm the Bitcoin economy; we believe in it. We have invested all our effort, time and money into the development of the Bitcoin economy. We agree that mining should be decentralized, but you cannot blame GHash.IO for being the #1 mining pool.\u201d It may be true that GHash.IO doesn\u2019t want to abuse its power, and Andresen may be right that it would be irrational for any future Bitcoin mining powerhouse to do so as well.

One of the challenges governments have faced in dealing with the phenomenon is whether to treat Bitcoin as a currency akin to dollars and yen or a commodity more similar to gold and silver. Deciding one way or another will be a major factor in how Bitcoin transactions are taxed. Japan\u2019s hand was forced largely by the failure of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest exchange for converting Bitcoins into other currencies. In the wake of the failure, Tsutomu Okubo, an opposition legislator, wrote an open letter asking the government to clarify its approach, and Mt. Gox is required by Japanese law to respond. Okubo told the Wall Street Journal that he has been in discussions with the country\u2019s banking regulator for about a year, and it doesn\u2019t seem interested in being Bitcoin\u2019s watchdog. Bitcoins are a nearly unprecedented combination of commodity and currency. The intent of their creator, a person or group of people known as Satoshi Nakamoto, was to create a form of exchange that would be anonymous and impossible for governments to manipulate. So: currency. But to date Bitcoins have proven most useful to digital goldbugs who want to bet on the astronomical rise in their value, and it\u2019s understandably hard to base a credible form of exchange on something whose value can double or halve over the course of a day. So: commodity.  Confusing matters more is that Bitcoin\u2019s value as a commodity comes from the belief that it will, eventually, become useful as a currency. Governments have been going different ways on this. The UK\u2019s tax authority recently backtracked on plans to put a value-added tax on Bitcoin trading, saying that it was a currency for tax purposes. Other countries say that Bitcoins fall short of the definition for currency and have kept trading taxes in place (Singapore) or prohibited banks from handling Bitcoins (China). \u201cConsidering the definition of an official currency as set out in law, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s also not a payment instrument, because the law stipulates that a payment instrument must have an issuer responsible for its operation,\u201d Paeivi Heikkinen, head of oversight at the Bank of Finland in Helsinki, told Bloomberg News. \u201cAt this stage it\u2019s more comparable to a commodity.\u201d There are no legal barriers to the country\u2019s citizens using Bitcoins as a means of exchange, but they do have to pay capital gains taxes as Bitcoin investments gain value. The U.S. is still considering how to regulate Bitcoin on the federal and state levels, and it could yet be treated as both a commodity and a currency, depending on the agency. As arguments continue to be made on both sides, some are apparently beyond the pale, though.

A financial startup is trying to change that by creating an exchange where people can bet on the future direction of the currency\u2019s value, up or down. New Jersey-based Tera Group said Monday it has already facilitated a trade between a company nervously holding Bitcoins and one willing to take the risk of the currency\u2019s value changing over the next 25 days. Leonard Nuara, Tera\u2019s co-founder, wouldn\u2019t identify the parties. Assuming that Bitcoin sticks around, this is a service many companies may consider.

Nuara says he\u2019s also been hearing from potential traders who would like to get in on the action. Some are Bitcoin optimists who don\u2019t mind taking the risks, while others think the value of Bitcoin at the end of all this is zero. \u201cThere is usually some person who thinks it\u2019s going up, and some person who thinks it\u2019s going down,\u201d he says.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-24/a-new-bitcoin-exchange-would-let-you-profit-on-the-currencys-fall', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 24, 18, 56, 37, 735000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Holding Bitcoins?

But there's one very safe 2015 prediction to make about the financial services industry itself: It will keep churning out new exchange-traded funds. One hundred ninety-nine new ETFs launched in 2014, a 30 percent jump over 2013. That expanded the total ETF universe to 1,666. And there are 1,111 new ETFs in registration, awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Among them are ETFs that would be the first ever to track activist investors, short-squeezed stocks and Saudi Arabia. Here\u2019s a look at the some of the biggest launches to look out for in 2015.  \u2022 Battle of the Bond Kings One of the biggest stories in the fund world in 2014 was Bill Gross\u2019 abrupt departure from Pacific Investment Management Co. Investors pulled $1.2 billion from his Pimco Total Return ETF (BOND\n). Gross is likely to be back with an ETF sooner rather than later; Janus's CEO has said the company is looking to put \u201cGross\u2019 excellence\u201d into an ETF. The other bond king, Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine, also plans an ETF. Gundlach has teamed up with State Street and filed to launch the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF. While there's no guarantee either ETF will launch in 2015, the chances are pretty good.  \u2022 Deeper Access Into China's Market China's economy may be slowing, but there's a boom in ETFs focused on giving direct access to its domestic stock and bond market. There are about 40 of these ETFs in registration to add to the eight that exist. Such \u201cA-shares\u201d have traditionally only been available to Chinese citizens. But the Chinese government has taken steps to open up their massive $9 trillion domestic market to foreign investors, which has ETF issuers in a frenzy to get products out. The returns have been red-hot. The CSI 300 Index, a popular A-share index, is up 48 percent this year. A-Share ETFs in this very full pipeline include the iShares FTSE China A50 Index Fund and the Deutsche X-trackers Harvest China A-Share Technology Sector Fund.  \u2022 A Bit Longer for COIN The most famous ETF filing of them all is the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (ticker-to-be: COIN). Any time a word is changed in the filing, it gets national media attention. COIN would purchase and store bitcoins in the same way that the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD\n) purchases and stores gold. The only difference is that the vault would be virtual. There is still doubt, however, that the SEC will approve the first-ever virtual asset ETF. The longer it sits in registration, the less likely it is to launch.   \u2022 A New Acronym: ETMFs Actively managed mutual funds have found a way to use the ETF structure without having to reveal holdings daily. In November, Eaton Vance won approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer exchange-traded managed funds, or ETMFs. These products would work just like regular mutual funds, where you buy into the fund at the net asset value at day's end. The twist is that you can buy these on an exchange at any time during the day; you get the end-of-day NAV, plus or minus wherever the ETF was trading when you bought. Odds are that ETMFs will cannibalize mutual fund assets rather than eat into the ETF pie. ETF investors have been very meh towards active management. When they want to try and beat the market, they\u2019ve used smart-beta ETFs and ETF managed portfolios, not stock and bond pickers.Follow short-squeezed\n on twitter Eric Balchunas is an exchange-traded-fund analyst at Bloomberg.

Hundreds of thousands of\xa0people rallied to curb the political and economic influence of the country\u2019s business elite.\xa0Zluf cites that movement as a source\xa0of inspiration for La\u2019Zooz, which means \u201cto move\u201d in Hebrew. Other ride-booking apps have set their sights on\xa0Israel for different reasons. The country\u2019s large, affluent population has plenty of smartphones and disposable income\xa0to spend on taxis.

Gett was Israel\u2019s most-downloaded Android transportation app on most days in August 2015, and Uber averaged 10th, according to research firm App Annie. La\u2019Zooz barely cracked the top 500 on a typical day.\xa0\u201cWe are aware of La\u2019Zooz, and wish them best of luck and success,\u201d said Li-or Avnon Solan, a spokeswoman for Uber. \u201cApplications like La\u2019Zooz not only demonstrate that there is consumer demand for a ride-sharing product but also that other companies share our vision of future mobility.\u201d\xa0Google, which bought the Israeli navigation startup Waze for about $1 billion in 2013, started testing\xa0its own\xa0carpooling service\xa0called RideWith in Tel Aviv this summer. It\u2019s unlikely that La\u2019Zooz will\xa0displace such established companies as Uber and Gett because its decentralized nature and virtually nonexistent marketing budget could\xa0make it seem unreliable,\xa0said Arun Sundararajan, a business professor at New York University whose recent research has focused on\xa0the sharing economy. \u201cThere are limits to how far a completely decentralized system like this could go,\u201d he said.\xa0\u201cPeople will still pay for better logistics, a more trusted system\u2014those are still things that are better done by a centralized platform.\u201d While it won\u2019t be easy for La\u2019Zooz\xa0to break through, it\u2019s starting to amass a fervent base of supporters. So far, about 2,500 people have signed up to use the app, which is available only\xa0on smartphones running Google\u2019s Android software. Users have left enthusiastic\xa0reviews on the Google Play store and on Twitter, often throwing around such words as \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\xa0Bitcoin developer\xa0Jeff Garzik\xa0says a decentralized transportation app such as\xa0La\u2019Zooz has the potential to\xa0\u201ceat Uber and Lyft.\u201d\xa0The trio behind the project has raised $120,000 from supporters and friends\xa0and has persuaded\xa0Ernst & Young to provide accounting services in exchange for digital tokens, said Zluf. Katherine Tarbox, a spokeswoman for Ernst & Young, declined to comment.\xa0Next, Zluf said, they are looking to raise an additional $1 million to develop an iOS version and more features. Yechiel Yogev, a 37-year-old industrial engineer\xa0who lives in the northern Israeli city of Migdal HaEmek, is an early\xa0fan. He started a Facebook page to promote La\u2019Zooz after discovering the app while reading up about bitcoin. Yogev\xa0used La\u2019Zooz\xa0recently to catch a ride to Haifa, a city near Tel Aviv in which\xa0companies that include Google, Intel, IBM, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Yahoo! have research and development facilities. \u201cI turn on the app, and it\u2019s just like hitchhiking.

There really is an awful lot going on today. Get caught up here. Greece has until Sunday to come to an agreement with creditors on the way forward or it risks being forced out of the euro. Last night\'s summit of euro area leaders delivered a firm message to Greece, with President of the European Council Donald Tusk saying "The stark reality is that we have only five days left to find the ultimate agreement," in his post-summit press conference.\xa0 With the Greek banking system barely functioning, the ECB today meets to decide on whether to grant further emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to those banks. Without a deal in place, the chances of an increase in ELA is remote, even though it is the only thing preventing the complete collapse of Greece\'s financial infrastructure. The sell-off in Chinese equities accelerated, with the Shanghai Composite Index closing down\xa05.9 percent to 3,507.19. The sell off could have been much worse except for two things. At least 1,331 companies -- equivalent to about 40 percent of China\'s stock market capitalization -- have suspended trading altogether and a further 747 hit their daily 10 percent down limit, halting further selling. Outside China, Hong Kong\'s Hang Seng Index plunged the most since 2008. The selloff in Chinese stocks has spread to commodities in Shanghai. Iron ore, soybean meal and even eggs all dropped by the maximum allowed by exchange limits. Analysts so far view this sell off as a spillover from the collapse in equity markets. Barclays Chief Executive Officer Antony Jenkins is to leave after just three years in the role.

ARK Investment Management, which oversees the first exchange-traded fund with exposure to the virtual currency, has almost doubled its money since investing in September, when currency volatility in developing economies touched a more than three-year high. Bitcoin rose beyond $500 for the first time in more than\xa0a year on the Bitstamp exchange this week, up from $230 at the end of August. First Greece, then China\u2019s currency devaluation, then expectations of\xa0a U.S. interest-rate increase boosted price swings and prompted an exodus of capital from emerging markets. That elevated Bitcoin\u2014a digital currency independent of a particular central bank or economy\u2014to safe-haven status and boosted flows into the asset, according to Cathie Wood, who founded ARK in January 2014. \u201cThis is going to take off in the emerging markets before it will take off here because there\u2019s so much volatility and instability,\u201d she said during an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in New York last month. \u201cThey know what trouble means; it usually means they\u2019ve got to develop some hedges.\u201d It may be early to take a victory lap as Bitcoin, which is known for making its own very sharp moves, has already fallen since the recent high. On Thursday the virtual currency hit $364 on Bitstamp before ending the day at $409. ARK\u2019s stake in Bitcoin also remains small\u2014about $200,000 in its Web X.0 fund despite increasing\xa0its position at least three times\u2014and accounts for 0.8 percent of the fund\u2019s returns in 2015, Bloomberg analysis shows. The overall fund has returned 15 percent this year, more than 98 percent of the 1,544 unleveraged ETFs in the U.S. Volatility in currencies, stocks, and fixed income has sapped the performance of investment funds this year. Those same price swings have, however, benefited Bitcoin, according to Ashraf Laidi, chief executive officer at Intermarket Strategy in London. \u201cChina\u2019s devaluation, the risk of a Greek exit, which may have diminished but could likely return, and the very foggy and dim future of subsequent rate hikes if the Fed ever does do liftoff, all of these matter and increase the volatility,\u201d Laidi said by phone on Wednesday. \u201cThey do lend an increasingly credible story to Bitcoin.\u201d ETFs can\u2019t currently buy Bitcoin directly. ARK instead added 1,100 shares, worth $33,000, in Bitcoin Investment Trust to its Web X.0 fund in September. ARK has since boosted those holdings, and the fund now owns 3,786 shares. Those were worth $204,444 as of Wednesday\u2019s close and 193,086 as of Thursday. Wood said she isn\'t worried about volatility in the cryptocurrency."The fact that Bitcoin has stabilized for a good nine, almost 12, months in the $200 to $300 range after a near-death experience with Mt Gox has given people more comfort that this thing is not going to implode," she said in a follow-up interview this week, referring to the collapse of one of Bitcoin\'s most popular exchanges.\xa0', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/rachelevans_ny', 'name': u'Rachel Evans', 'twitterhandle': u'rachelevans_ny'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-06/an-etf-that-invested-in-bitcoin-has-been-having-a-nice-few-weeks', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 6, 13, 4, 28, 760000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'An ETF That Invested in Bitcoin Has Been Having a Nice Few Weeks'}, {'articleText': u" Volkswagen shares plunge, Greece re-elects Syriza and Fed officials still point to 2015 hike. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about this morning. Shares in Volkswagen AG plunged\xa0more than 20 percent this morning\xa0after it admitted cheating on U.S. pollution tests for years. The German carmaker had fitted its U.S. diesel vehicles with software programmed to reduce pollutants when the car underwent official emissions testing, the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday. The company could be liable for fines of up to $18 billion based on the cost per violation and the number of cars involved. Alexis Tsipras' Syriza party gained 35.5 percent of the vote in yesterday's Greek election, well ahead of the second place New Democracy party, which\xa0garnered 28 percent. Due to the enhanced majority rule in Greek elections, where the party with the plurality of votes receives a 50-seat bonus in the 300 seat parliament, the victory for Syriza means they plan to form a coalition government with the same small Independent Greeks party they had previously governed with. The new government must now carry out the reform agenda as required by the latest bailout. Three Federal officials\xa0argued over the weekend that an interest-rate increase is still warranted this year, with\xa0San Francisco Fed President\xa0John Williams,\xa0St. Louis Fed President\xa0James Bullard and Richmond Fed President\xa0Jeffrey Lacker all singing from the same hawkish sheet. On the other side of the Atlantic, Goldman Sachs is expecting further easing from the European Central Bank, projecting the central bank will extend their asset purchase program into 2017. Goldman has said the euro currency may fall up to 10 U.S. cents due to this easing.\xa0 Zurich Insurance Group AG has dropped an 5.6 billion pound ($8.7 billion) offer for RSA Insurance Group Plc due to a loss on its own general insurance business. The Zurich loss has been\xa0affected by claims from a series of explosions in China last month that may cost the insurer as much as $275 million. Shares in RSA fell more than 20 percent this morning following the announcement.\xa0 Hedge funds have slashed their bets on further oil-price declines, leaving them the most bullish in two months on the commodity. OPEC is expecting oil prices to gradually recover to $80 a barrel by 2020, with U.S. production set to slip as the current price rout extends a slump in drilling there.\xa0West Texas Intermediate for\xa0October delivery, which expires Tuesday, was at $45.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 64 cents, at 10:50 a.m. London time.\xa0 This is what's caught our eye over the weekend.

Is it property, something to be owned? Is it a currency, something to be spent? Or is it a commodity, defined by Webster\u2019s Dictionary as \u201cany useful thing,\u201d and/or \u201canything bought and sold; any article of commerce.\u201d The\xa0U.S. Internal Revenue Service thinks bitcoin is property; a federal judge thinks it\'s a currency; now the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has decreed it a commodity. That\xa0means the regulator can now bring charges against any wrongdoers trading cryptocurrency futures and options. In a statement, the CTFC\u2019s Director of Enforcement, Aitan Goelman, said: \u201cWhile there is a lot of excitement surrounding Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets," said Aitan Goelman, the CFTC\'s director of enforcement of the decision.\u201d Does the\xa0ruling change the fundamental nature of what Bitcoin is, and how its advocates will use and develop it?\xa0We asked leading members of the bitcoin community for their views. \u201cThere are so many regulators in the U.S., and they all want more jurisdiction, which leads to a constant stream of bizarre rulings. None of them has much work to do because there\u2019s not a whole lot of financial innovation happening in the States. So when they find a small one-man startup they can\u2019t resist giving themselves work to do \u2013 so they go in and whack it, especially in California. \u201cI\u2019m not terribly surprised and not terribly worried. I think the CFTC has a very weak case here and it\u2019s a very creative reinterpretation of what the word commodity means. The ruling will be challenged and judges will apply common sense and decide it to be a currency" as happened in the Silk Road case.\u201d - Mike Hearn, software developer specializing in Bitcoin \u201cThis ruling is obviously very consequential to U.S.-based Bitcoin futures trading platforms, but it\u2019s important not to overplay the implications. Last year, the U.K. tax authority ruled that Bitcoin is a currency. Last month a Japanese judge ruled that Bitcoin is not property. These rulings concerning what Bitcoin is or is not are for\xa0certain purposes only,\xa0but they often get taken out of context.\u201d - Vili Lehdonvirta,\xa0Research Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute \u201cIn the U.S. there are regulators that look at Bitcoin from their own perspective and just arbitrarily make up a rule or guidance. New York regulates it as a currency, for example. It\u2019s just not sensible. If this ruling does affect anyone, they\u2019ll just move to offshore jurisdictions. \u201cBitcoin has many uses \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s used, traded as a commodity but it\u2019s also used as a currency and a technology.\u201d - Gareth Grobler, founder of the IceCUBED Bitcoin\xa0exchange \u201cRegulators need to be talking with each other and engaging with industry. The CFTC doesn\u2019t seem to have done either of those. Just claiming a platform is illegally offering bitcoin options isn\u2019t helpful if they\u2019re trying to have a relationship with these companies. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more collaboration in the U.K. between the Treasury, the FCA, HMRC and the top Bitcoin companies. To date the government hasn\u2019t taken a public position that they\u2019ve had to take back. \u201cHaving said that I\u2019d rather Bitcoin were regulated as a commodity because commodity regulations are the lightest.\u201d - Mark Lamb, CEO of Coinfloor Bitcoin exchange \u201cAs money, Bitcoin is terrible \u2013 a deeply deflationary currency that\u2019s within a bubble. It\u2019s an OK commodity but it\u2019s the equivalent of selling real estate on the moon. There\u2019s no inherent value. I applaud the ability of speculators to make money from selling it to other people, but I don\u2019t think even calling it a commodity is enough. It\u2019s a kind of shadow asset. \u201cMoving towards a system where proponents of Bitcoin could use a less stark designation for marketing purposes would have been a mistake. So it\u2019s very prudent to classify Bitcoin as something relatively uncontentious, simply something bought and sold for a price, rather than something contentious, like a currency or other financial asset.\u201d - Stephen Kinsella, Senior Lecturer in Economics at the University of Limerick \u201cIf you\u2019re using Bitcoin as a remittance tool you\u2019re not going to like this, but if you\u2019re using it as a business this regulation gives you a framework that\u2019s predictable. However a lot of the value proposition of Bitcoin is tied up in the non-compliance aspect. With the cost of compliance can companies stay competitive? \u201cRegulation of Bitcoin is necessary and premature at the same time. It\u2019s the fault of the federal system. If you\u2019re in England, everything happens in one city \u2013 regulators can easily visit the Chancellor, Bank of England and the companies.

The FCA survey includes data from 49 firms that manage $481 billion globally and from 106 funds with assets of $345 billion. None was identified in the report. Hedge funds also increased their leverage. The measure rose to about 64 times firms\u2019 assets in September from 54 times their assets in March of last year, the FCA said. The increase in leverage came mostly from interest-rate derivative positions, the FCA said. Jack Inglis, chief executive officer of the Alternative Investment Management Association Ltd., a lobby for the U.K. hedge fund industry, said leverage isn\u2019t as high as the FCA indicates.

Lawyer Fired Fights for Whistle-Blower Rights After Fraud Report A lawyer fired after raising concerns about corruption is seeking whistle-blower status in a U.K. lawsuit that might expand the protection to tens of thousands of professionals. Krista Bates Van Winkelhof was a partner at Clyde & Co. LLP in Tanzania when she reported in 2010 that an African lawyer working in association with the U.K. law firm was involved in bribery and money laundering. She sued after being suspended and expelled from the partnership in 2011, and her case reached the U.K. Supreme Court for a hearing yesterday. The U.K. has been cracking down on corruption by British companies overseas, giving prosecutors more power to file bribery charges. A victory for Van Winkelhof would expand whistle-blower rules, which normally protect salaried workers, to members of professional partnerships.

Once users have Bitcoins, they store them on their computers or mobile devices in files known as Bitcoin wallets or in cloud-based \u201ce-wallets.\u201d Hajduk says Infiniti Poker will accept credit cards, wire transfers, and other payment options, but players in the U.S. will be able to play only using Bitcoins. He originally included the currency not to get around U.S. law but to reduce the time it takes to cash players out. Bank transactions can take up to 12 weeks; players who use Bitcoin\xa0can get a payout in a matter of hours, he says. GamblingCompliance, which tracks the global gaming industry, says most estimates value the U.S. online gambling market at $4\xa0billion to $6\xa0billion. On Black Friday, gamblers in the U.S. had more than $100\xa0million in online accounts frozen. Nearly two years later, the U.S. government is still working to reimburse the players, who were not targeted in the crackdown. Hajduk says the ability to store Bitcoins on players\u2019 computers is appealing. \u201cAt the end of the day, [the government] cannot freeze your account because they cannot kick down the door to Bitcoin,\u201d he says. It\u2019s unclear whether the government will go after Bitcoin gambling sites. \u201cBitcoin poses some new legal challenges for financial authorities,\u201d says Martin Williams, the Asia editor of GamblingCompliance. \u201cI suspect that much of it will involve playing catch-up, as with so many other things relating to the Internet.\u201d The Justice Department declined to comment. There are other risks as well. In recent months hackers have pulled off several Bitcoin heists, and this summer Bitcoin Savings & Trust, billed as a \u201cBitcoin hedge fund,\u201d made off with more than $5\xa0million entrusted to the site by investors, in what appears to be a Ponzi scheme. Also, Bitcoin wallets can vanish as a result of hard-drive crashes or other computer problems. That\u2019s how at least one user lost 50,000 Bitcoins, according to Peter Vessenes, chairman of Bitcoin Foundation, an organization that helps develop and promote the virtual currency. \u201cIt\u2019s still a pretty raw technology,\u201d says Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at Bitcoin Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that it\u2019s been designed by geeks for geeks. It\u2019s not easy to use yet, but it\u2019s getting easier to use all the time.\u201d Bitcoin gaming sites keep popping up. Erik Voorhees, director of marketing and communications at BitInstant, helped design SatoshiDice, a gambling site hosted in Ireland and owned by an anonymous investor. Since launching in April, the site has taken in about $15\xa0million in bets, Voorhees says. SatoshiDice is careful to keep everything in Bitcoin; until it\u2019s clear how the site will be treated legally, \u201cit\u2019s better to keep it completely separate from real life,\u201d he says. When it comes to letting Americans gamble with Bitcoins, not everyone is as bold as Hajduk and SatoshiDice. Josh Strike, who in 2011 launched the Costa\xa0Rica-based Bitcoin casino site Strike Sapphire, says he makes sure Americans can\u2019t access his games. \u201cI\u2019m an American, and the guys who help me with this\u2014lawyers, part-owners, guys I\u2019ve known since high school\u2014they\u2019re American,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get anyone in trouble.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': u'Caroline Winter', 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-03/bitcoin-making-online-gambling-legal-in-the-u-dot-s-dot', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 1, 3, 23, 51, 35, 173000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin: Making Online Gambling Legal in the U.S.?'}, {'articleText': u'  Greece doesn\u2019t have pressing financing needs as its creditors leave the country without an agreement enabling a disbursement under a rescue package, an International Monetary Fund spokesman said. \u201cThe timing of the disbursement really depends on how the discussions evolve,\u201d Gerry Rice, the IMF\u2019s communications director, told reporters today in Washington. \u201cWe believe that Greece\u2019s financing needs in the coming months can be met from existing liquidity buffers.\u201d The Greek government and officials from the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European Commission have been locked in talks since September, with the two sides disagreeing over fiscal measures needed for the country to achieve its 2014 budget projections.

The twins, who attended Harvard University at the same time\nas Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and claimed in a lawsuit\nthat the idea for the social media site was theirs, this week\nfiled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create\nthe Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, a variation of an exchange-traded\nfund that would hold Bitcoins and issue shares on a secondary\nexchange.  The trust would be the first product in the $2 trillion ETF\nindustry to track a virtual asset, rather than securities such\nas stocks and bonds or commodities such as gold and oil. The\nbiggest hurdle for the 31-year-old brothers is persuading the\nSEC, which has moved haltingly when approving funds that break\nnew ground, to give their product the green light. The\nexamination could take years, according to Reginald Browne, head\nof exchange-traded product trading at Knight Capital Group Inc.  The trust aims to attract investors who might be put off by\nthe complexities and costs associated with trading in the\ndigital currency.  \u201cWe recognized that there was not an easy way to gain\nBitcoin exposure, so we\u2019re trying to creating a simple\nsolution,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss said in an e-mailed statement.  Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to buy and\nsell a broad range of items. The Winklevosses own about $10\nmillion of Bitcoins, 1 percent of the outstanding amount.  Regulators haven\u2019t released comprehensive guidance on how\nBitcoins might be regulated.  The SEC\u2019s division of corporate finance reviews\nregistration statements for securities issuers to make sure they\ncomply with disclosure requirements, John Nester, a spokesman,\nsaid in an interview. The review doesn\u2019t produce any comment on\na product\u2019s utility, he said. The Bitcoin trust would also\nrequire approval from the agency\u2019s division for trading and\nmarkets, he said.

Drugmakers operating in Europe must disclose payments made\nto doctors starting in 2016 in an effort to boost transparency\nand make patients aware of possible conflicts of interest.  The new ethical code requires all members of the European\nFederation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations to\ndisclose payments made in 2015 by 2016, the trade group said in\na statement July 2.  Each company must reveal names of health-care professionals\nand associations that have received payments, the amounts, and\nthe types of relationships on their websites or on a common\nwebsite, EFPIA said. The rule follows a similar U.S. provision\nin President Barack Obama\u2019s health law.

China may restart trading of government bond futures in\nSeptember, the China Securities Journal reported July 3, adding\nto signs an 18-year ban is drawing to an end.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission will decide on\nan exact time for the start of trading after the State Council\napproved the plan for government bond futures, the newspaper,\nwhich is controlled by the official Xinhua News Agency, reported\nJuly 3, citing people it didn\u2019t identify. Trial trading of the\nfutures during the past year has gone smoothly, the paper said.  China first allowed trading of treasury futures in 1992,\nbefore ordering a halt in 1995 after a probe into market\nmanipulation led to the jailing of Guan Jinsheng, then president\nof Shanghai International Securities Co.

Global\ndata-protection regulators last month wrote to the Mountain\nView, California-based company urging Chief Executive Officer\nLarry Page to contact them about possible issues with its web-enabled eyeglasses, called Google Glass.  \u201cOur privacy policy respects European law and allows us to\ncreate simpler, more effective services,\u201d Al Verney, a\nBrussels-based spokesman for Google, said by phone. \u201cWe have\nengaged fully with the authorities involved throughout this\nprocess and will continue to do so going forward.\u201d  Data protection regulators from the 28-nation EU, that make\nup the so-called Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, wrote\nto Page in October, saying the company \u201cempowers itself to\ncollect vast amounts of personal data about Internet users\u201d\nwithout demonstrating the collection is \u201cproportionate,\u201d and\nasking the company to bring its policy in line with EU rules.  Spain started proceedings to sanction Deloitte SL and\npartner Francisco Celma Sanchez over their role as auditors of\nBankia SA before it was nationalized last year.  The Spanish Accounting and Audit Institute, a unit of the\nEconomy Ministry, said Deloitte may have breached rules that\ncould have compromised its independence as an auditor, according\nto a June 13 report obtained by Bloomberg. Sanctions may include\na fine or, in the worst case, stripping Deloitte and Celma of\ntheir licenses to work as auditors in Spain, the report showed.  Deloitte may have had a conflict of interest because it\nadvised Bankia\u2019s parent company on its corporate structure at\nthe same time it was auditing the lender, the institute said.  \u201cThis proceeding could perfectly well be dismissed or\ncould conclude with a proposed penalty,\u201d Deloitte said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cThe proceeding focuses on technical\nformalities which\xa0in no case represent a modification of the\nentity\u2019s audited financial statements.\u201d  Deloitte has 15 days from June 13 to respond to the\nallegations, the document said.

Tom Hayes, the former UBS AG and Citigroup Inc. trader, is\nscheduled to enter a plea on charges related to manipulation of\nthe London interbank offered rate later this year.  Hayes, 33, was told by a judge in London yesterday to enter\na plea at a hearing in late October. He spoke only to confirm\nhis name. Prosecutors at the Serious Fraud Office agreed to give\nhim more information on their case by Sept. 30.  Hayes, who remains on bail, is charged with working with\nemployees at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Royal Bank of Scotland Group\nPlc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Rabobank Groep and Deutsche Bank AG, as\nwell as Tullett Prebon Plc, ICAP Plc and RP Martin Holdings\nLtd., over a four-year period to manipulate yen Libor rates.  At his first court appearance last month, Hayes\u2019s lawyer,\nLydia Jonson, declined to indicate how he would plead when asked\nby a judge.  Four of the charges cover the period from Aug. 8, 2006,\nuntil Dec. 3, 2009, while he worked at UBS, and the other four\nfrom Dec. 1, 2009, until Sept. 7, 2010, when he was at\nCitigroup.  Hayes tried to manipulate rates \u201cwith the intention that\nthe economic interests of others would be prejudiced and/or to\nmake personal gain for themselves or another,\u201d the SFO said in\nthe indictment.  Hayes has also been charged by the U.S. Justice Department,\nwhich is running a parallel criminal investigation.  Aalberts Industries NV overcame a court bid by antitrust\nregulators to reinstate a 100.8 million-euro ($130 million)\ncopper cartel fine.  The EU Court of Justice, the bloc\u2019s top tribunal, dismissed\nthe European Commission\u2019s attempt to resurrect the penalty in a\nruling yesterday. A lower court overturned the fine against\nLangbroek, Netherlands-based Aalberts in March 2011.  Europe\u2019s biggest maker of fittings used in taps and heaters\nwas one of 30 companies fined a total of 314.7 million euros in\n2006 for unlawfully colluding on prices of copper fittings used\nin plumbing and heating. Aalberts\u2019s fine was 6 percent of its\n2010 revenue of 1.68 billion euros.

Cohen isn\u2019t likely to face\ncriminal charges tied to the biggest alleged insider-trading\ncase in history as U.S. prosecutors conclude there\u2019s not enough\nevidence to meet a statute of limitations deadline to file a\ncase, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar\nwith the situation.  The evidence against Cohen, 57, that involves his $15\nbillion firm SAC Capital Advisors LP isn\u2019t strong enough, the\nnewspaper reported yesterday. It didn\u2019t name its sources.  The case, part of a five-year U.S. crackdown of insider\ntrading at hedge funds, stems from the insider-trading case\nagainst former SAC portfolio manager Mathew Martoma, who was\ncharged in November in what prosecutors called the biggest\ninsider-trading scheme in history. SAC paid a record $602\nmillion to settle a civil case related to Martoma\u2019s trades. The\nfive-year statute of limitations deadline for prosecutors to\nbring charges for Martoma\u2019s 2008 trades expires in late July.  Martoma has pleaded not guilty and isn\u2019t cooperating with\nthe U.S.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen\n& Co., declined to comment on the report. Jim Margolin, a\nspokesman for the FBI in New York, didn\u2019t return a voice-mail\nmessage and e-mail message sent after business hours yesterday\nseeking comment. Martin Klotz, a lawyer for Cohen, didn\u2019t\nrespond to an e-mail seeking comment. Jerika Richardson, a\nspokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, declined\nto comment.  Cohen, who has denied any wrongdoing, hasn\u2019t been charged\nwith any crime.  The case is U.S. v. Martoma, 12-cr-00973, U.S. District\nCourt, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  HSBC Holdings Plc\u2019s $1.9 billion agreement with the U.S. to\nresolve charges it enabled Latin American drug cartels to\nlaunder billions of dollars was approved by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York,\nsigned off July 1 on a deferred-prosecution agreement, a\ncritical component of the London-based bank\u2019s settlement. The\norder was filed more than six months after the government\nannounced reaching an accord with the bank.  Both sides argued Gleeson didn\u2019t have the power to approve\nor reject the terms they came to, the judge said in his order.\nGleeson disagreed, writing in his order that the court is \u201cnot\na potted plant\u201d and approving the deferred-prosecution\nagreement is \u201cthe legitimate exercise of the court\u2019s\nauthority.\u201d  HSBC was accused of failing to monitor more than $670\nbillion in wire transfers and more than $9.4 billion in\npurchases of U.S. currency from HSBC Mexico, allowing for money\nlaundering, prosecutors said.  Gleeson said he will continue supervising implementation of\nthe deal, under which the bank agreed not to contest criminal\ncharges of failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program, among other violations.  The bank, Europe\u2019s largest, agreed to pay a $1.25 billion\nforfeiture and $665 million in civil penalties, prosecutors\nannounced in December.  The case is U.S. v.

Charney, of course, founded American Apparel and was its chairman, chief executive officer, president, public face (and oh, so much more). But who is Allan Mayer? Mayer first met Charney in 2004, after the publication of the now notorious article in Jane magazine\u2014the one where Charney masturbated in front of the reporter, with her consent and while talking about business. Mayer was a crisis manager; Charney, a perennial candidate for crisis management. After American Apparel went public in 2007, Charney invited Mayer to join the board. He\u2019s now co-chairman and one of only two board members to keep their seats after a deal with hedge fund Standard General on July\xa09 to rescue the company. Mayer wrote and edited for Newsweek, founded Buzz magazine, wrote two books, and worked in book publishing before getting into the damage control business in 1997. That\u2019s when he began to work with Michael Sitrick, a master of spin and a powerful, inevitable presence in Los Angeles and beyond. In 1998, Mayer and Sitrick wrote a book called Spin: How to Turn the Power of the Press to Your Advantage. Mayer helped Sony Pictures deal with protests against The Da Vinci Code and aided Universal Pictures in the studio\u2019s response to threatened boycotts against the movie Munich. He also\xa0advised Halle Berry after her hit-and-run accident, and Rush Limbaugh after his addiction to prescription painkillers became public. He worked with Britney Spears during her many crises, and with Tom Cruise and Eminem, too. \u201cThe celebrity scandals get the headlines,\u201d Mayer says. \u201cBut they\u2019re the equivalent of one-night stands. You get the client out of trouble, and you move on. It\u2019s much more interesting and fun to have long-term relationships, to help people build something.\u201d That, he says, is mostly what he\u2019s doing now as head of the strategic communications division of 42West, a rival of Sitrick\u2019s. Strategic communications? \u201cFor years, I\u2019ve been looking for an unpretentious way to describe what I do,\u201d Mayer says. \u201cStrategic communications counsel is the best I could come up with. A lot of my clients think of me as a consigliere. In the old days, I would have been called a fixer.\u201d Among his current clients are Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. \u201cThe world learned about them in a very odd way, through Aaron Sorkin\u2019s conception of them,\u201d Mayer says. \u201cThey\u2019re very smart entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, because of the movie [The Social Network], they got entangled in the world of the tabloids and gossip sites, and it\u2019s been extremely difficult to extricate themselves from all that. I\u2019m helping them.\u201d The Winklevosses\u2019 latest venture: an exchange-traded fund for the virtual currency Bitcoin. In 2010, Mayer and Sitrick were involved in a public-relations dispute of their own. Mayer joined a lawsuit\xa0that claimed Sitrick had manipulated an employee stock ownership plan before the sale of his company.

George Samman, a former Wall Street investment adviser who in May helped start a platform for betting on Bitcoin\u2019s price swings, saw trading on his BTC.sx website grow to more than $35 million by Jan. 21. After the shutdown at Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange for buying Bitcoins, BTC.sx suspended trading -- because it had to find another exchange partner for its customers. \u201cIt is semi-Wild West, but that\u2019s only because it\u2019s new,\u201d Samman said before the Mt. Gox shutdown. The regulation of Bitcoin, let alone derivatives of it, is an unresolved question in many parts of the world. Even as regulators and investors struggle to grasp Bitcoin\u2019s many uses - - including investment vehicle, payment-processing system and money-laundering tool -- they are now confronted with the additional complexities of an emerging derivatives market where entrepreneurs say current rules don\u2019t apply. Russia has said Bitcoin is illegal under current law, while China has stopped financial institutions from dealing in it, even as trading continues. In the U.S.. states are wrestling with how digital-currency businesses could be regulated, including as money transmitters. In Europe, the European Banking Authority said today that it would set up a task force to review options for regulating Bitcoin and its derivatives. At the top U.S. derivatives regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, lawyers are considering if and how to oversee derivatives linked to Bitcoin and other digital currencies, according to two people briefed on its work. The agency has been preparing an internal memo that examines CFTC\u2019s authority over digital currencies and how it might exercise those powers to regulate the markets, the people said. Steve Adamske, CFTC spokesman, declined to comment. Mt. Gox, which had revenue of 135 million yen ($1.33 million) in the year ended March, applied in Tokyo District Court today with debt exceeding its assets by 2.7 billion yen, the exchange said in a statement. The company said it had lost 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to users and 100,000 of its own. Traders like Samman say a robust Bitcoin derivatives market may someday smooth the volatility that has plagued the digital currency. Over the last year, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose from $20, peaked at $1,147 and dropped to as low as $534.71 on Feb. 25, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Bitcoin investors who can hedge against the price falling, the traders say, would have less reason to dump the volatile currency in a panic, contributing further to stability. As U.S. regulators ponder their next move, some entrepreneurs already conducting trades are betting that dealing only in Bitcoin, not U.S. dollars, will protect them from oversight until the rules are clear. The firms, in Ireland, Britain and Singapore -- and one founded by two Russians -- are already serving thousands of U.S. customers. Patrick Murck, the general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the currency, said the rules will vary with the services offered. \u201cFinancial services that use the Bitcoin protocol can and often do fall into existing regulatory categories,\u201d Murck said in an e-mail. \u201cSome uses of the protocol may fairly be considered trading in derivatives and regulated by the CFTC, while others likely will not.\u201d The digital currency was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has since gained traction with merchants around the world. Bitcoin has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify transactions while preserving users\u2019 anonymity. Because it has properties normally associated with a traditional currency, entrepreneurs have sought to create uses for it that mimic those of the U.S. dollar, the euro and other currencies. \u201cBitcoin protocol is a really genius way of sending wealth across the world, very quickly, very cheaply, which has appeal to many people,\u201d said Arthur Hayes, founder of Bitmex, a Bitcoin derivatives trading platform due to start operations in June. Hayes said by phone today from Hong Kong that he\u2019s weighing where to base his platform, which depends on the regulatory environment. Bitmex will allow users to trade futures and options on Bitcoin against currencies from the Group of 10 nations. The CFTC could argue that Bitcoin is a commodity under U.S. law and subject to the agency\u2019s rules against manipulation and fraud, according to Salman Banaei, Washington-based senior counsel at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm. He said the agency, which regulates derivatives tied to interest rates and commodities like oil and wheat, would have \u201cclearer\u201d jurisdiction over futures, swaps and options linked to Bitcoin. \u201cFor example, a Bitcoin futures exchange in the United States, or a foreign exchange offering \u2018direct access\u2019 to its trading engine to U.S. customers would generally have to register with the CFTC,\u201d said Banaei, who last year left the CFTC, where he helped write regulations. Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who has taken an interest in digital-currency issues, on Jan. 16 called on the CFTC to lift the \u201cfog of uncertainty\u201d over Bitcoin by clarifying its jurisdiction in the area. Jaron Lukasiewicz, chief executive of Coinsetter LLC, a New York-based Bitcoin exchange, said that his company has suspended plans to offer derivatives due to the uncertainty around the CFTC\u2019s intentions, plus the expense of maintaining a derivatives-broker license. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep pressing forward on it, and we hope that reputable companies will be given the chance to offer this essential addition to the market,\u201d Lukasiewicz, a former investment banker with JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in an e-mail. Among the firms offering Bitcoin derivatives is Predictious.com, which lets users bet on various events, such as the price of Bitcoin against the U.S. dollar. Other potential bets have nothing to do with Bitcoin, such as the outcome of the Academy Awards and the World Cup this year in Brazil. Because all bets are made and settled in Bitcoin, regulations in the U.S. or otherwise aren\u2019t relevant to Predictious, according to Flavien Charlon, a software developer who created the site in his free time. He said he hasn\u2019t had any contact with regulators about the site, and that it has about 3,000 users, the \u201cbulk\u201d of them in the U.S. \u201cFor the moment, I don\u2019t think the regulators care what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Charlon said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure over time they\u2019ll look into it.\u201d The CFTC has shown some interest in regulating predictions venues outside the U.S. Intrade, an Ireland-based predictions market, asked its U.S. customers to close their accounts in November 2012 after the CFTC sued its parent company, Dublin-based Trade Exchange Network Ltd. Charlon said he doubted that the CFTC could prevent customers in the U.S. from using Predictious, since the online \u201cwallets\u201d used to hold Bitcoin aren\u2019t attached to a specific country, and because many customers use Internet browsers that obscure their location. The Bitcoin derivatives market Icbit.se took shape in 2011 when Alex Bragin and another Russian put together a website that now offers Bitcoin futures. Clients can borrow as much as five times their own capital for leveraged investments, and Bragin intends to create an options market as well. The most popular derivative on Icbit.se is a futures contract that pays out based on the dollar price of Bitcoin on the largest exchange at the time of settlement, Bragin said. About $30 million worth of the contracts -- a single unit is $10 -- have been sold, he said. Bragin said there\u2019s no need to deal with regulators now because no rules exist for Bitcoin derivatives that don\u2019t settle in fiat, or government-issued currencies. \u201cDealing only in Bitcoin saves us from the hassle of dealing with the usual money-related rules and regulation,\u201d Bragin said, echoing the position of Samman at BTC.sx \u201cThere is no law in Bitcoin right now, and we only deal in Bitcoin,\u201d Samman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t deal in fiat.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-28/bitcoin-derivatives-sprout-as-regulators-play-catch-up', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 28, 16, 38, 6, 816000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Derivatives Sprout as Regulators Play Catch-Up'}, {'articleText': u'  Executives of China\u2019s largest banks called on regulators to curb the rapid expansion of Internet financing in that nation. The form of financing has siphoned off so much business from traditional banking that it was labeled a \u201cblood-sucking vampire\u201d by a commentator on state-run television. One focus of critics\u2019 ire has been Yu\u2019E Bao, the fund pioneered nine months ago by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s online-payment affiliate Alipay. Its ease of use, involving a few taps on a smartphone, has drawn deposits from 81 million customers chasing returns higher than China\u2019s banks can offer. Bank executives, unable to stop the decline in their cheapest source of funding because interest rates on comparable deposits are fixed by the government at 0.35 percent, are calling for more regulation, saying that lack of oversight and risks related to account security, yield volatility and liquidity management threaten China\u2019s financial stability. China\u2019s policy makers are pushing for unprecedented changes in the banking system, including deposit insurance and deregulating interest rates, to give markets a bigger role in the economy. Cheap funding costs have enabled banks to fuel industry overcapacity and excessive borrowing by state-owned companies and local governments. Cigarette Smuggling Prompts Crackdown by States Losing Billions Higher cigarette taxes are prompting a smuggling trade along routes on the East Coast, and states are trying to stem the contraband to fight crime and regain lost revenue. Lawmakers in Virginia and Maryland boosted the penalties on smuggling in the past year. A Massachusetts commission released a report March 1 recommending a crackdown on trafficking. Legislation is pending in states including New Jersey and Rhode Island. As states and the federal government raised tobacco taxes, the profit incentive for smugglers increased. States are trying to prevent the loss of billions of dollars in revenue and to combat an increase in organized crime. Santander Fined $20.5 Million by U.K. Watchdog on Advice Flaws Banco Santander SA was fined 12.4 million pounds ($20.5 million) by the U.K. regulator for flaws in investment advice given to customers as the watchdog clamps down on misconduct in consumer lending. The fine, the biggest for the U.K. arm of Spain\u2019s largest lender, follows a probe by Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority started more than a year ago. The watchdog found that Santander failed to prevent customers from getting misleading information, didn\u2019t carry out regular checks on customers, and didn\u2019t ensure new advisers were properly trained before giving advice. The Spanish bank received a 30 percent discount from the FCA because it settled at an early stage in the investigation. Santander has closed its investment advice arm as a result of the probe. \u201cSantander U.K. takes its regulatory obligations very seriously and has cooperated fully with the FCA\u2019s investigation,\u201d the company said in an e-mailed statement. Hackers Selling Exploits for Bitcoins Thriving in Illicit Market Hackers from the U.S., Russia and Ukraine hawk computer exploits for as much as $300,000 on an underground market fueled by digital currencies like Bitcoin, a report by Rand Corp. and Juniper Networks Inc. shows. The trade in software, data or commands that takes advantage of computer bugs generates billions of dollars using digital storefronts that connect sellers and buyers or where mercenaries can be hired to do the job, according to the report released yesterday. Exploits, as tools for conducting computer attacks are known, can be used for illegal acts from stealing data off a mobile device to breaching corporate databases, according to the report. Hackers are increasingly using virtual currencies to hide their identities, as well as so-called darknets, or private forums, according to the report. IRS to Make Limited Use of Offshore Bank Data, Koskinen Says The Internal Revenue Service initially will make limited use of information supplied by other governments about U.S. citizens\u2019 offshore holdings because of budget constraints, Commissioner John Koskinen said at a conference in Washington. Major pieces of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or Fatca, take effect July 1. The law has led to agreements with governments around the world to exchange information. Koskinen said he was conscious of the potential difficulties foreign banks are having in developing compliance systems.

Gox. When Kano, 38, left his job as a derivatives and convertible bonds trader in December, bitcoin had climbed to a record $1,151. Three months later, it was worth half that after a $530 million heist at Tokyo-based Mt. Gox bankrupted what was once the virtual currency\u2019s largest exchange. \u201cThat\u2019s one less competitor for us, but it also left many Japanese with a very negative impression of bitcoin,\u201d Kano said in an interview in Tokyo on July 17. \u201cWe already had a company then and felt it was up to us to rebuild the trust.\u201d Since Mt. Gox closed in February, acquiring the digital currency in Japan meant going to the city\u2019s only bitcoin ATM machine or arranging a person-to-person deal. Kano\u2019s bitFlyer website allows anyone with a Japanese bank account to buy and sell the coins. The service began in April and eschews the trading options used by other exchanges in favor of a simple interface that would appeal to beginners, Kano said, declining to give subscriber numbers. While Mt. Gox, operated by a Frenchman residing in Tokyo, catered mostly to foreigners, its bankruptcy was widely covered by domestic media. That has tended to scare off Japanese individuals, who Kano says are already averse to risks. Not so the nation\u2019s government. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has taken a hands-off approach to the virtual currency which it sees aiding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s push to spur venture funding for innovation, a June report by the LDP\u2019s special committee on IT strategy shows. Kano raised 160 million yen ($1.6 million) from a Japanese venture capital firm to start bitFlyer in what he says was the country\u2019s biggest investment in bitcoin to date. He is now seeking to raise cash from an overseas fund so the company can offer the service outside of Japan by year-end, he said. \u201cIf we have another fiasco like Mt. Gox, it\u2019s game over,\u201d Kano said, speaking in his company\u2019s sparsely-furnished, glass-walled office a few blocks away from the Japanese parliament. \u201cThere needs to be monitoring to prevent that from happening.\u201d Kano\u2019s company is also seeking to set security standards and personal identification guidelines for bitcoin trading in the Asian nation, through the Japan Authority of Digital Asset, which groups bitFlyer with CoinPass and the Japanese unit of Kraken, a San Francisco-based exchange. Trading of the digital currency may expand as new entrants seek to take advantage of the vacuum left by Mt. Gox. BitOcean, a Chinese startup, joined with New York-based Atlas ATS Inc. to bid for the assets of the defunct exchange operator and the two companies plan to start a bitcoin platform in Japan by August, Nan Xiaoning, the Beijing-based founder and chief executive officer of BitOcean, said in an interview on July 15. Kraken is also planning a Japanese-language website for bitcoin-yen trading, Chief Executive Officer Jesse Powell said in an interview with Kyodo News in March. The exchange currently accepts dollars, euro and the Korean won. Bitcoin fetched $618.71 or 459.45 per euro as of 9:13 a.m. in Tokyo today, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Unlike most of its rivals, which link buyers and sellers together, bitFlyer is the counterparty for either transaction, Kano said. That allows for deals to be concluded instantaneously and without complicated price-setting mechanisms that can be off-putting to newcomers, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a major advantage we have over other exchanges, but it also means we take on the risk,\u201d he said. \u201cControlling that risk is something you can\u2019t do without experience.\u201d Kano first joined Goldman Sachs in 2001 after graduating from Tokyo University with a Master\u2019s degree in fluid dynamics. The branch of physics studying movement of liquids and gases gave Kano an appreciation for complex systems and the programming skills needed to simulate them, he said.

RBS from 2002 to 2011 hid or failed to disclose information about the identities of sanctioned parties in 3,500 transactions valued at approximately $523 million, the New York Department of Financial Services said Dec. 11 in a statement. The U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Federal Reserve also were part of the settlement. RBS said in a statement that it \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d its oversight failures and pledged to strengthen compliance controls. The bank cooperated with the investigation and has fired several employees who were involved in the wrongdoing, said Benjamin Lawsky, New York\u2019s top banking regulator. Britain\u2019s largest state-owned lender said it would claw back three-quarters of the money from bonuses and awards already paid to employees after it was fined $612 million for manipulating rates in a separate case over Libor in February.

Fed\u2019s Evans Says CFTC Right to Reevaluate Computerized Trading U.S. regulators should reevaluate whether markets have sufficient risk controls in place to oversee high-frequency trading, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other agencies are right to consider new ways of monitoring derivatives markets that increasingly rely on electronic trading and not \u201chuman judgment and human speeds,\u201d Evans said in a comment letter to the CFTC dated Dec. 11. The letter was posted on the CFTC\u2019s website yesterday. The Chicago Fed staff, in a response to a CFTC request for comments on possible new regulations for automated trading, said consistent risk controls are necessary to remove the danger that algorithms can malfunction. The CFTC, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission, boosted scrutiny of high-frequency and algorithmic trading after May 6, 2010, when $862 billion in equity value was erased in 20 minutes before share prices recovered. CFTC members voted unanimously on Sept. 9 to issue a concept release requesting input on more than 100 questions, including whether to expand testing and supervision of high-speed trading strategies. Traders Losing $1 Million Build EU Case for Bitcoin Rules Trading Bitcoins could bleed you dry, the European Union\u2019s top banking regulator said as it weighs whether to regulate virtual currencies. Thefts from digital wallets have exceeded $1 million in some cases and traders aren\u2019t protected against losses if their virtual exchange collapses, the European Banking Authority said today in a report warning consumers about the risks of cybermoney. Virtual currencies such as Bitcoin have come under increased scrutiny from regulators and prosecutors around the globe. China\u2019s central bank barred financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions last week and German police arrested two suspects in a fraud probe into illegally generated Bitcoins worth 700,000 euros ($963,000). Since Bitcoins exist as software, the virtual currency isn\u2019t controlled by any government or central bank. The digital money emerged in 2008 and is being used to pay for everything from Gummi bears to digital cameras on the Web, with more than 12 million in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks the online money\u2019s activity. The virtual currency gained credibility last month after law enforcement and securities agencies said in U.S. Senate hearings that it could be a legitimate means of exchange. For more, click here. JPMorgan Said in Talks to Pay $2 Billion to End Madoff Probes JPMorgan Chase & Co., the target of multiple U.S. Justice Department investigations, tentatively agreed to pay about $2 billion to resolve probes into whether it ignored warning signs about Bernard Madoff\u2019s crimes, according to a person briefed on the matter. The bank also assented to a deferred prosecution agreement, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private. In such deals, the government agrees not to prosecute for a specified period and charges are dismissed if the entity improves its programs and complies with the law. The talks are in their final stages and the accord could be announced before year-end, the person said. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to resolve government probes that have beset JPMorgan, while overhauling internal controls to improve relations with regulators. Wall Street firms including JPMorgan have spent years fighting off claims brought on behalf of Madoff\u2019s victims. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has been investigating how New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, handled funds controlled by Madoff, whose multibillion-dollar fraud was the biggest Ponzi scheme in the nation\u2019s history. James Margolin, chief public information officer for Bharara\u2019s office, and Peter Donald, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, declined to comment.

Ex-Banker Ordered to Pay Insider Trading Gains to Investors Former Morgan Stanley managing director Du Jun was ordered to pay HK$23.9 million ($3.1 million) to investors who sold him shares in 2007, for which he was jailed for trading with inside information. The order by Hong Kong\u2019s High Court yesterday benefits about 300 investors in Citic Resources Holdings Ltd., the Securities and Futures Commission said in a statement. The payments represent the profit they could have made had the inside information been known. The restoration orders are the first by a Hong Kong court in an insider dealing case. Du, part of a team of Morgan Stanley bankers advising the Chinese commodities trader on acquiring oil-field assets, was convicted in 2009. Du\u2019s lawyer from Chong & Partners wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment on yesterday\u2019s ruling. Insider trading was criminalized in the former British colony in 2003 and carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. The case is Securities and Futures Commission v. Du Jun, HCMP1407/2007 in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance. GLG to Pay $9 Million Over SEC Claims of Overvaluing Assets GLG Partners Inc., the hedge-fund firm owned by Man Group Plc, agreed to pay $9 million to settle allegations by U.S. regulators that it overvalued assets in an emerging-markets fund. GLG overvalued its stake in a coal-mining company from 2008 through 2010 due to internal-control failures, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement yesterday. That resulted in inflated fees and the overstatement of assets under management in filings with the SEC, the regulator said. U.K. Loses Fight at Top EU Court on Company-Tax Refund Curbs The U.K. unlawfully curtailed the deadline for companies to claim refunds for wrongly paid tax, the European Union\u2019s top court in Luxembourg ruled yesterday. The EU Court of Justice said the U.K. violated EU law by depriving companies \u201cwithout notice and retroactively\u201d of the right to recover taxes that they shouldn\u2019t have had to pay under a system ruled illegal more than a decade ago. It\u2019s the third time the U.K. courts sought the EU tribunal\u2019s guidance in a challenge by a group of 20 companies, including British American Tobacco Plc, against the country\u2019s advance corporation tax system, which ran from 1973 to 1999. While London-based Aegis Group Plc, which has since been taken over by Dentsu Inc., is the only company in that group to be affected by yesterday\u2019s case, many other pending claims depend on yesterday\u2019s decision, said Chris Morgan, head of tax policy at KPMG U.K. Warren Says \u2018Glass-Steagall 2.0\u2019 Still Needed for Banks U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, talked about banking industry regulation and entitlement programs.

Swiss Bank Chairmen Object to Tougher Rules, Bilanz Says Swiss banks are more stable than banks abroad, UBS AG Chairman Axel Weber and Credit Suisse Group AG Chairman Urs Rohner said in a preview of a joint interview to be published in Bilanz magazine today. \u201cI am confident that in 2015 no tightening of the rules will be necessary,\u201d said Rohner. It doesn\u2019t make sense to speculate before the agreed appraisal of Swiss banking rules in 2015, according to the interview of Weber and Rohner. The so-called Swiss finish on liquidity and capital requirements will be \u201cconsiderably higher\u201d than elsewhere, Weber said. Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said Nov. 3 that lenders including UBS and Credit Suisse may have to pull out of investment banking as she called for their leverage ratios to be raised. \u201cBanks would have to consider whether to carry on with investment banking or focus even more on asset management,\u201d Widmer-Schlumpf was quoted as saying in an interview with Schweiz am Sonntag at the time.

Wright, a 44-year-old Australian academic and entrepreneur, may be the pseudonymous figure, Satoshi Nakamoto, who unleashed the bitcoin software in 2009, Wired reported after a weeks-long investigation that included examining leaked documents and e-mails. Online publication Gizmodo reported that it followed a similar trail of documents indicating Wright and an American computer forensics expert who died in 2013 were involved in developing the digital currency. Nobody picked up the phone or returned a voicemail left at DeMorgan Ltd., identified by Gizmodo as a company run by Wright in northern Sydney.

Gox. When Kano, 38, left his job as a derivatives and convertible bonds trader in December, bitcoin had climbed to a record $1,151. Three months later, it was worth half that after a $530 million heist at Tokyo-based Mt. Gox bankrupted what was once the virtual currency\u2019s largest exchange. \u201cThat\u2019s one less competitor for us, but it also left many Japanese with a very negative impression of bitcoin,\u201d Kano said in an interview in Tokyo on July 17. \u201cWe already had a company then and felt it was up to us to rebuild the trust.\u201d Since Mt. Gox closed in February, acquiring the digital currency in Japan meant going to the city\u2019s only bitcoin ATM machine or arranging a person-to-person deal. Kano\u2019s bitFlyer website allows anyone with a Japanese bank account to buy and sell the coins. The service began in April and eschews the trading options used by other exchanges in favor of a simple interface that would appeal to beginners, Kano said, declining to give subscriber numbers. While Mt. Gox, operated by a Frenchman residing in Tokyo, catered mostly to foreigners, its bankruptcy was widely covered by domestic media. That has tended to scare off Japanese individuals, who Kano says are already averse to risks. Not so the nation\u2019s government. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has taken a hands-off approach to the virtual currency which it sees aiding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s push to spur venture funding for innovation, a June report by the LDP\u2019s special committee on IT strategy shows. Kano raised 160 million yen ($1.6 million) from a Japanese venture capital firm to start bitFlyer in what he says was the country\u2019s biggest investment in bitcoin to date. He is now seeking to raise cash from an overseas fund so the company can offer the service outside of Japan by year-end, he said. \u201cIf we have another fiasco like Mt. Gox, it\u2019s game over,\u201d Kano said, speaking in his company\u2019s sparsely-furnished, glass-walled office a few blocks away from the Japanese parliament. \u201cThere needs to be monitoring to prevent that from happening.\u201d Kano\u2019s company is also seeking to set security standards and personal identification guidelines for bitcoin trading in the Asian nation, through the Japan Authority of Digital Asset, which groups bitFlyer with CoinPass and the Japanese unit of Kraken, a San Francisco-based exchange. Trading of the digital currency may expand as new entrants seek to take advantage of the vacuum left by Mt. Gox. BitOcean, a Chinese startup, joined with New York-based Atlas ATS Inc. to bid for the assets of the defunct exchange operator and the two companies plan to start a bitcoin platform in Japan by August, Nan Xiaoning, the Beijing-based founder and chief executive officer of BitOcean, said in an interview on July 15. Kraken is also planning a Japanese-language website for bitcoin-yen trading, Chief Executive Officer Jesse Powell said in an interview with Kyodo News in March. The exchange currently accepts dollars, euro and the Korean won. Bitcoin fetched $618.71 or 459.45 per euro as of 9:13 a.m. in Tokyo today, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Unlike most of its rivals, which link buyers and sellers together, bitFlyer is the counterparty for either transaction, Kano said. That allows for deals to be concluded instantaneously and without complicated price-setting mechanisms that can be off-putting to newcomers, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a major advantage we have over other exchanges, but it also means we take on the risk,\u201d he said. \u201cControlling that risk is something you can\u2019t do without experience.\u201d Kano first joined Goldman Sachs in 2001 after graduating from Tokyo University with a Master\u2019s degree in fluid dynamics. The branch of physics studying movement of liquids and gases gave Kano an appreciation for complex systems and the programming skills needed to simulate them, he said. After 3 1/2 years as an analyst he left to join BNP Paribas SA to learn how to trade.

Masters, who helped develop credit-default swaps two decades ago, was named Tuesday as the chief executive officer of Digital Asset Holdings LLC. The New York-based company plans to use bitcoins and blockchain technology for settlement and record-keeping of the likes of stocks, mortgages or loans. Bitcoins are part of an anonymous, decentralized network protected by cryptographic codes that works outside the banking system. Computers communicate with one another to verify transactions on bitcoin\u2019s public ledger, called the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies have been criticized for their potential in illicit deals and are known for their embrace by libertarians. Digital Asset\u2019s vision is to keep the speed and digital efficiencies of bitcoin and blockchain while adding a layer of disclosure that would reassure Wall Street banks and regulators. The venue will provide a closed system that only vetted members can use. \u201cTrading takes place at warp speed -- settlement doesn\u2019t,\u201d Masters said in an interview. Masters, who rose from a JPMorgan intern to global head of its commodities arm over 27 years, stepped down from the New York-based bank last year after completing the sale of units she oversaw. Digital Asset\u2019s aim isn\u2019t to cut out such banks from trading and settlement processes, but to improve their back-office operations, in which settlement cycles can take more than 20 days for some assets, she said. The company has reached out to regulators, Masters said. Digital Asset has about 10 employees spread across Chicago, New York and Tel Aviv. The company was founded last year by Don Wilson, founder and chief executive of DRW Trading Group, and Sunil Hirani, CEO of TrueEX LLC. \u201cBlythe\u2019s unique vision, leadership qualities and dynamism were the key ingredients that we looked for in a CEO to help re-invent the aging, costly and hack-prone legacy processes and infrastructure of settlement services,\u201d Hirani said in a statement from Digital Asset. Masters rose to prominence in the 1990s after helping develop credit swaps, the derivatives that enable investors to hedge risks on bonds.

Ford watched emerging markets melt down and read warnings that the U.S. economy could crater too. As prices dropped, he overcame the impulse to flee with the rest of the herd and, instead, bought more corporate bonds, Bloomberg Pursuits will report in its Summer 2014 issue. After two decades as a trader, Ford credits his serenity to experience -- and to the 20 minutes he spends in his pajamas each morning repeating a meaningless mantra bestowed on him by a teacher of Transcendental Meditation two years ago. \u201cI react to volatile markets much more calmly now,\u201d Ford, 48, says. \u201cI have more patience.\u201d He also has more money. Latigo Partners LP, his event-driven credit fund, climbed 24 percent last year. He almost beat the surging stock market with a bond fund. Ford is part of a growing number of Wall Street traders, including A-list hedge-fund managers Ray Dalio, Paul Tudor Jones and Michael Novogratz, who are fine-tuning their brains -- and upping their games -- with meditation. Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, who once likened a chief executive officer to a drug addict during one of his frequent public rants, in February praised meditation while sharing a stage with the Dalai Lama in Washington, D.C. The idea that Type-A traders are seeking profit with the same tool that Buddhist monks use to achieve enlightenment might seem like sacrilege. Yet most people misunderstand meditation, says Jay Michaelson, author of \u201cEvolving Dharma: Meditation, Buddhism, and the Next Generation of Enlightenment.\u201d \u201cMeditation used to have this reputation as a hippie thing for people who speak in a particularly soft tone of voice,\u201d Michaelson says. Not so. \u201cSamurai practiced meditation to become more effective killers,\u201d he says. So too did kamikaze pilots. \u201cIt\u2019s value neutral,\u201d Michaelson says. Workers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are folding into the lotus position in droves, says Elizabeth Sudler, an instructor the firm retains. Classes where students breathe and monitor their wandering minds have waiting lists several hundred long, Goldman spokesman David Wells says. One trader there gets a twinge in his gut when he senses a move in the markets, Sudler says. Meditating gives him an edge, he told her, by tuning into that sensation more reliably. Others report downshifting more easily after work and sleeping better at night. \u201cGoldman employees are under a lot of pressure to produce,\u201d Sudler says. \u201cNo one wants to be left behind.\u201d Meditation is going mainstream in part because science is substantiating what heretofore had been taken on faith. Up until 1983, only three peer-reviewed studies on meditation had ever been published, Michaelson says. By last year, there were more than 1,300 studies showing an almost absurd number of benefits, from alleviating anxiety, depression and insomnia to reducing heart disease and speeding recovery from psoriasis. A 2005 study published by Harvard Medical School neuroscientist Sara Lazar showed that meditating enhances the prefrontal cortex, likely creating more connections between neurons and enlarging blood vessels. Among other functions, the prefrontal cortex processes sensory information, handles rational decisions and regulates the amygdala, the structure that feeds our fight-or-flight instinct. A tame amygdala may be why David Ford bought bonds amid the panic -- a prescient move as markets rebounded. Michaelson calls meditation \u201cbrain hacking,\u201d because it exploits the elastic nature of our gray matter, altering its makeup, as Lazar and other scientists have proved. As such, it may be the ultimate disruptive technology, he says. That kind of talk gets the attention of traders, says Jeff Walker, former head of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s private-equity unit and a longtime meditator. \u201cThese guys are saying, \u2018There\u2019s an edge here that I need,\u2019\u201d Walker says. Humans have been meditating in some form for millennia. Hindu texts from 1500 BC describe the practice, which hit the big time when a Hindu prince named Siddhartha Gautama became disenchanted with the empty opulence of the day and took up residence beneath a fig tree to contemplate the causes of human suffering. (Hint: Desire is a key culprit.) Through the teachings of Siddhartha -- who sat down a prince and, after 49 days, arose the Buddha -- mindful meditation radiated out into the world. There are many forms of meditation. Vipassana, for example, starts with concentrating on one thing, such as the breath. If a dog barks, you might register it before quickly refocusing on inhaling and exhaling. Mental intrusions are treated the same way: Thoughts such as \u201cbook NetJets\u201d or \u201coffload bitcoins\u201d quickly pass like leaves floating on a stream. Jon Kabat-Zinn, founding executive director of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, defines mindfulness as \u201cpaying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment and nonjudgmentally.\u201d The aim is to become more aware of the present and avoid getting hijacked by the past or the future. Central to Buddhism are the unsettling notions that everything we know is impermanent and that all we have is the here and now. Transcendental Meditation uses a mantra -- the repetition of a single sound -- to settle the mind into its least-excited state. The TM folks, through the years, have consistently asserted their superiority over other disciplines. The website of the nonprofit Maharishi Foundation USA, for example, has variously claimed that \u201conly TM has been found in hundreds of studies to produce immediate and long-term wellness benefits of mind and body\u201d and that \u201cno other program for personal development has received this level of attention and respect from the scientific community.\u201d Transcendental Meditation was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (n\xe9e Mahesh Prasad Varma). Born near Jabalpur, India, around 1918, the Maharishi, or Great Seer, started teaching his method in 1955 and became a guru to the Beatles, who famously traveled to Rishikesh, India, in 1968 to study with him. Despite Transcendental Meditation\u2019s claims of superiority, John Denninger, director of research at the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that any difference in outcome is big enough to say you need to do one type of meditation over another,\u201d Denninger says. \u201cGetting people to do it in the first place is what matters.\u201d Some of the most-striking research has come from the University of California at Davis. Clifford Saron, a neuroscientist there who speaks with the slow, gentle tone of a holy man, went to the foothills of the Himalayas in the 1990s to study Buddhist monks. Their serene focus inspired him to organize the Shamatha Project. With his friend and former monk B. Alan Wallace, Saron selected 60 people and tested their attention and cognition. Thirty of them then attended a meditation retreat in Colorado. (The other 30 went later.) After three months, Saron re-examined the initial group and discovered any number of striking changes. For one, the meditators were literally more perceptive: They could discern smaller differences between long and short lines flashed on a screen. \u201cHow much does an infant learn when it is alert and relaxed?\u201d Saron asks rhetorically. \u201cThat works for us, as well.\u201d Some of Saron\u2019s subjects also exhibited lowered levels of cortisol, the hormone produced by the adrenal gland to help us deal with stressful situations, such as getting chased by a water buffalo -- or watching a stock holding get crushed after an unfavorable earnings report. (Cortisol is also associated with increased belly fat and diminished cognitive performance; in other words, it makes us fat and stupid.) Perhaps most surprising: Levels of telomerase, an enzyme that protects genetic material during cell division and delays cell death, were higher in the retreat group. By boosting telomerase, meditation could possibly extend life. Skeptics, including some who\u2019ve logged countless hours of silent sitting, say that the promise of meditation sometimes exceeds what\u2019s practical. Tony Schwartz, author of \u201cBe Excellent at Anything: The Four Keys to Transforming the Way We Work and Live,\u201d says he\u2019s meditated for hundreds of hours, starting 25 years ago. \u201cBut the more time I spent meditating, the less value I derived from it,\u201d he wrote in a January column in the New York Times. Nor has he seen evidence that the practice makes people happier or leads to better behavior. \u201cDon\u2019t expect more than it can deliver,\u201d he wrote. Meditation\u2019s arrival on Wall Street closes a circle of sorts. Whereas Siddhartha Gautama took to the lotus position out of frustration with his riches, traders are hitting the mat to obtain them. Dalio, for example, runs the largest hedge-fund firm in the world and is worth $14 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He\u2019s also the most vocal proponent of meditation in finance and claims the practice has been the single biggest factor in his success. Dalio, 64, discovered Transcendental Meditation through the Beatles. He\u2019s been at it for 42 years, sitting for 20 minutes, twice on most days, he says. He\u2019s so convinced of its benefits that he pays half the cost of Transcendental Meditation instruction for the employees at his Westport, Connecticut\u2013based Bridgewater Associates LP. A competitive edge, not enlightenment, seems to be driving Dalio. \u201cI feel like a ninja in a fight,\u201d Dalio said of his professional equanimity, during a February panel discussion in New York on the benefits of meditation. \u201cWhen it comes at you, it seems like slow motion.\u201d Tudor Jones is another hedge-fund billionaire on a quest for inner peace and profit. A PBS documentary from 1987 shows him trading in the most agitated, un-Buddhalike manner imaginable. Twenty-five years later, he and his wife, Sonia, an Ashtanga yoga enthusiast, gave $12 million to create the Contemplative Sciences Center at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Jones\u2019s alma mater. David Mick teaches an undergraduate business school course there called \u201cCultivating Wisdom and Well-Being for Personal and Professional Growth.\u201d He recommends meditation and takes each semester\u2019s students on a field trip to Yogaville, a nearby ashram. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a wiser person if you can\u2019t discipline your mind,\u201d says Mick, who meditates every morning. Willoughby Britton, a neuroscientist at Brown University, warns that neophytes should proceed with caution. Spending hours contemplating impermanence can foster anxiety and sadness. She has seen people experience psychotic episodes on meditation retreats, convincing themselves, for example, that the teacher is evil and must be killed. \u201cThis is a powerful drug; it\u2019s not a hot bath,\u201d Britton says, adding that the risks are worth the rewards. Unlike some other Western practitioners, Joan Halifax, a roshi, or revered teacher, at the Upaya Zen Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico, says she\u2019s concerned the lords of finance are using meditation for unjust ends, ignoring the moral principles embodied in Buddhism. \u201cYou can train people with meditation to be sharpshooters,\u201d she says. \u201cAre they trying to get smarter so they can exploit more people? Or are they interested in creating a more just financial system?\u201d Dalio, for one, has agreed to give most of his fortune to charity under the Giving Pledge program started by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, a move that would probably have impressed the Buddha himself, who lived by daana, or a spirit of generosity. Before you give that fortune away, though, you have to earn it. Some of the brightest minds in finance are betting that meditation will help them do just that.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-28/to-make-killing-on-wall-street-start-meditating', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 5, 28, 4, 0, 1, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'To Make a Killing on Wall Street, Start Meditating'}, {'articleText': u'  Backpage.com, an online classified advertising service, was sued by two women who claim the website operator helps pimps and traffickers in the sexual exploitation of minors. The company \u201cprofits substantially\u201d from enabling illegal commercial sex transactions, including by shielding the identity of those who post ads and deceiving law enforcement about internal protocols for detecting sex ads involving children, the women, identified as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, said in a complaint filed yesterday in Boston federal court. Users of Dallas-based Backpage.com, the second-largest online classified ad service in the U.S., can post ads for everything from motorcycles for sale to community events. \u201cThey really are the dominant force in the online Internet sex trade today,\u201d said John Montgomery, a lawyer at Ropes & Gray LLP, which filed the suit voluntarily without payment. \u201cOur case here is not about the content of the ads, but rather the structure and purpose of a business that has become an essential participant, and really driver, of the market.\u201d Liz McDougall, a lawyer for Backpage.com, declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying she just received it and hadn\u2019t had a chance to review it. In the past two years, Backpage.com has prevailed in barring enforcement of laws in Washington, Tennessee and New Jersey that aimed to hold online service providers criminally liable for advertisements that turned out to involve sexual exploitation of a minor, McDougall said. By trying to hold the service liable for third-party information, the laws were found to violate the federal Communications Decency Act as well as the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech, according to McDougall. In 2009, a federal judge in Chicago dismissed a lawsuit against Craigslist Inc. that accused the the classified ads website of creating a public nuisance by maintaining a forum used for prostitution services. The judge found that the site wasn\u2019t legally liable for the content of ads published on the site by others. The following year, amid pressure from state attorneys general, Craigslist.org removed a category for adult services, which is when Backpage.com undertook to become the dominant player in the illegal online sex market, according to the complaint filed yesterday. This latest suit differs from previous legal attempts to hold Internet classified ad providers accountable for facilitating commercial sex transactions, in that it accuses Backpage.com of \u201csubstantially contributing to the trafficking operations,\u201d particularly with respect to minors, Montgomery said. Backpage.com is owned and operated by Camarillo Holdings LLC, formerly known as Village Voice Media Holdings LLC, and takes its name from the back page of the New York weekly Village Voice newspaper, which carried classified ads for sex, according to the complaint. The Village Voice is no longer owned by Camarillo Holdings. The website facilitates at least 80 percent of all online commercial sex advertising in the country, according to the lawsuit. Backpage.com has taken various steps to make the site attractive for pimps, traffickers and customers, even while creating a facade that it works with law enforcement to police illegal activity, according to the complaint. Backpage doesn\u2019t require age verification to post ads in its \u201cEscorts\u201d section and allows for anonymous payments, including through the use of largely \u201cuntraceable\u201d Bitcoin virtual currency, according to the complaint. There\u2019s also no phone number verification and the site allows posters to include contact information in obscured forms using combinations of letters and numbers such as \u201ctwoO13fourFive678niNe\u201d instead of\u201c201-345-6789,\u201d according to the complaint. The website operators also use software that allows photos to be uploaded while deleting metadata with critical identifying information, according to the complaint. While the site uses filtering software that prohibits ads from carrying forbidden terms such as \u201cteenage\u201d and \u201cschoolgirl,\u201d other terms such as \u201cyoung,\u201d \u201cunderage\u201d and \u201cfresh\u201d aren\u2019t blocked. Terms such as \u201cbarely legal\u201d and \u201chigh school\u201d are also prohibited, though Backpage.com permits \u201cbrly legal\u201d and \u201chigh schl,\u201d according to the complaint.

Entrepreneur Niko Younts said he sold the BitcoinWallet.com name in January for $250,000 -- 23 times what he paid a month earlier. Investors buying bitcoin-related Web addresses in hopes of a fast resale are fueling a domain-name boom. Some 3,290 names ending with .com or .net and containing \u201cbitcoin\u201d have been registered since May 12, according to Verisign, which operates a registry for those top-level domains. Prices for addresses referencing digital currencies such as bitcoin have tripled since last year, Rob Lagsam, sales director at domain-name seller BinaryCoin.com, said in an e-mail. While some sold for $5 a few years ago, brokerage Domain Guardians Pty Ltd. is now trying to sell BTC.com, based on an abbreviation for bitcoin, for more than $1 million. \u201cPremium, generic, category-defining domains are like prime real estate,\u201d Mike Robertson, co-founder of Brisbane, Australia-based Domain Guardians, said in an interview. \u201cOwning a name like BTC.com would be like owning a shop front\u201d on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue, London\u2019s Oxford Street or the Los Angeles area\u2019s Rodeo Drive. Should Domain Guardians get its price of more than $1 million, that still would be far short of the record for a domain name. The highest price paid was $13 million for Sex.com in 2010, according to DNJournal.com, which tracks the industry. Another potential high-price domain name, Bitcoins.com, is set to be auctioned off by Heritage Auctions, with an opening bid set at $185,000. Heritage estimated that the name may sell for more than $750,000. Some 30,000 domain names with \u201cbitcoin\u201d or another digital currency, \u201clitecoin,\u201d in them have been registered since 2010 through GoDaddy Inc., the largest registrar of the titles, said Mike McLaughlin, a senior vice president at the Scottsdale, Arizona-based company. The registrations peaked at more than 5,000 in December, when bitcoin\u2019s price passed $1,100, he said in an interview. With bitcoin prices lower and many of the best names snapped up, registrations have slowed to a few hundred a month, McLaughlin said. Bitcoins traded at about $617 at 5:50 p.m. New York time yesterday on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which represents an average of prices across major online exchanges. The CoinDesk peak was $1,147.25 on Dec. 4. Not all the domain names are going to speculators. Some are being acquired by entrepreneurs wanting to jump into the bitcoin market with business ideas who need an easy-to-find website, McLaughlin said. \u201cEspecially if you are interested in starting a small biz, one of the first things you do is stake out your space on the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of folks were probably looking at the bitcoin market and saying, how am I going to play on this?\u201d Alex Charfen, who with a partner bought the BitcoinWallet.com name, said they wanted to make their new business easy to find through Google searches. \u201cWe had an idea for a way of making a bitcoin wallet easier for people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe bought the domain because we knew we could optimize it and have a lot of traffic.\u201d They introduced their software for securely holding bitcoins in March, and the site has had 6,700 users since April 3, when the service began to be promoted, Charfen said. Bitcoin Shop Inc., an online retailer whose stock ticker was changed to BTCS in March, bought the domain name btcs.com for $12,250. \u201cThat was quite lucky,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Charles Allen said in an interview. The Arlington, Virginia-based company, which sells more than 140,000 products in transactions using bitcoins and other virtual currencies, is refusing to buy bitcoinshop.com, whose owner is asking for $100,000, he said. The company has been operating at bitcoinshop.us. \u201cWhat you are seeing is all the media hype around bitcoin, and everyone is trying to grab the domain names,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut startup companies are not going to play that. You can\u2019t get venture funding if you are going to spend $250,000 on a domain name. The industry\u2019s too young, we can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Some domain-name owners are willing to wait for the industry to mature. Charlie Shrem, who co-founded startup BitInstant LLC and was indicted on money-laundering charges in April by U.S. prosecutors in Manhattan, said he has bought several hundred domain names for about $5 each since 2011 and plans to let entrepreneurs whose projects he likes to use them \u201cpretty much for free.\u201d So far, Shrem said in an interview, he\u2019s declined all offers for names such as bitcoin.vc and watchbitcoin.com that he owns. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten offers in the tens of thousands,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if someone\u2019s offering this much, what will someone else offer?\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-11/bitcoin-domain-name-prices-defy-drop-in-virtual-currency-s-value', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 11, 4, 0, 1, 5000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Domain-Name Prices Defy Drop in Virtual Currency\u2019s Value'}, {'articleText': u'  Financial firms mustn\u2019t be so scared of their regulators that they fail to develop new investment products, according to the industry\u2019s top U.K. watchdog.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest today rejected Ross William Ulbricht\u2019s argument that U.S. investigators didn\u2019t have the legal authority to search his Gmail and Facebook accounts, a server in Iceland or a laptop. Ulbricht claimed the Federal Bureau of Investigation breached his privacy by accessing the server and electronic accounts during the investigation of the Silk Road site. Ulbricht failed to argue he had any connections to the accounts and server, perhaps to avoid incriminating himself, Forrest said in rejecting the claim. \u201cThe court does not know whether Ulbricht made a tactical choice because he is -- as they say -- between a rock and a hard place, or because he truly has no personal privacy interest,\u201d Forrest said in today\u2019s ruling.

Buyers could find anything on the site from heroin and hacking software to contact information for hit men in more than 10 countries, according to the prosecutors.

He was also indicted in federal court in Maryland for allegedly trying to arrange the murder of an employee he feared would become a witness against him.

Criminal attacks against health-care providers have more than doubled in the past five years, with the average data breach costing a hospital $2.1 million, according to a study today from the Ponemon Institute, a security research and consulting firm. Nearly 90 percent of health-care providers were hit by breaches in the past two years, half of them criminal in nature, the report found. While intrusions like ones exposing millions of consumers at health insurer Anthem Inc. and hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc. have increased risk awareness, most of their peers are still unprepared for sophisticated data attacks, security experts have said. \u201cThe health-care industry is being hunted and hacked by the elite financial criminal syndicates that had been targeting large financial institutions until they realized health-care databases are more valuable,\u201d said Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro Inc., who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Medical records, which often contain Social Security numbers, insurance IDs, addresses and medical details, sell for as much as 20 times the price of a stolen credit-card number, according to Dell SecureWorks, a unit of Dell Inc. Thieves can use that information to take out a loan or open up a line of credit in the victim\u2019s name, or for medical identity theft, where the victim\u2019s insurance ID is used by an impostor seeking free medical care. About half of health-care organizations surveyed by Ponemon said they didn\u2019t have sufficient technology to prevent or quickly detect a breach, or the personnel with the necessary technical expertise. \u201cThe organizations are getting better, but it is a slow-moving train,\u201d said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute. He said many firms are moving from paper-based to automated systems, a transition that makes them \u201cvery vulnerable to criminal attacks.\u201d Last year, health records on 88.4 million people were breached as a result of theft or hacking -- about twice as many as in 2010, according to a database kept by the Department of Health and Human Services, which requires organizations to report breaches involving more than 500 patients.

The CCEDK Crypto Coins Exchange Denmark ApS, which is due to open this month, is offering its trading platform to people across the globe, Chief Executive Officer Ronny Boesing said in an interview. The exchange will initially provide customers with the possibility to trade Bitcoin and Litecoin against each other, as well as in exchange for Danish and Norwegian kroner, British pounds, dollars and euros. Safety has emerged as a key theme in determining Bitcoin\u2019s fate as a viable payment form. The software was at the center of a money laundering scandal in January, when Bitcoin Foundation Vice Chairman Charlie Shrem was charged by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara for allegedly attempting to sell the crypto-currency to narcotics traffickers. He denied the charges in April. The trial starts in September. Bitcoin then suffered a further setback in February when Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan after it couldn\u2019t account for 850,000 units of the virtual currency. \u201cOur strongest selling point will be that clients will know where we are, that the jurisdiction is Danish and that there\u2019s complete transparency,\u201d Boesing said. \u201cWe link to our lawyer on our website in case anyone feels they need one.\u201d The European Banking Authority in December cautioned against using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, noting that no \u201cspecific regulatory protections exist that would cover you for losses if a platform that exchanges or holds your virtual currencies fails or goes out of business.\u201d Boesing said his exchange will operate as if it were overseen by a financial watchdog, because \u201cthere could be a decision to regulate this kind of business in the future. We are also ready for that.\u201d Denmark\u2019s Financial Supervisory Authority said in December it was looking into the need for regulation. Michael Landberg, the watchdog\u2019s chief legal adviser, said then the most likely outcome would be an \u201camendment to existing financial legislation so that we have regulation covering it.\u201d Danish regulators will \u201cseek to follow the mainstream,\u201d he said, adding \u201cit just needs to be regulated.\u201d Bitcoin has already encountered some hurdles in Scandinavia. A number of the region\u2019s biggest banks have distanced themselves from the payment form and rejected requests from clients seeking to set up accounts amid concern the software could be used to aid crime. SEB AB, the Nordic region\u2019s largest currency trader, cited \u201clarge uncertainties\u201d surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s status, in a January interview. The bank said then it won\u2019t offer transactions, accounts or currency exchange services in Bitcoin for that reason. Nordea Bank AB, Scandinavia\u2019s biggest lender, said the same month it won\u2019t offer any services related to trading Bitcoin and is advising clients of the risks associated with the payment form. Boesing says his exchange will set aside 30 percent of revenue generated from trading crypto-currencies to create a buffer to protect clients from crime-related losses. \u201cThe only way people will be able to lose money on our exchange is as a result of an investment loss,\u201d Boesing said. \u201cThey\u2019re protected from criminal acts.\u201d  Download: Bloomberg Law Brief: Rise in Crime Using Bitcoin (Audio)   Download: Bloomberg Law: Shepherd on Rise in Crime Using Bitcoin (Audio) ', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-22/bitcoin-exchange-guarantees-clients-crime-free-trade-in-denmark', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 5, 22, 22, 0, 1, 3000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Exchange Guarantees Clients Crime-Free Trade in Denmark'}, {'articleText': u' Former Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit is part of a group of investors plowing $5.9 million in a new digital exchange aimed at making it easier for smaller investors to buy loans made to mid-sized companies. MMKT, which raised seed funding from Leonard Tannenbaum\u2019s Fifth Street Asset Management Inc., aims to break open the club-like world of middle-market loan sales, according to a person with knowledge of the investment. Pandit will be joined by venture-capital firms QED Investors and Victory Park Capital, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information hasn\u2019t been made public. This is the latest attempt by new players to gain a foothold in the lucrative business of selling corporate debt. Blythe Masters, who quit JPMorgan Chase & Co. last year, is pushing to apply blockchain\u2013 the digital protocol underlying the virtual bitcoin - as one way of improving liquidity in the syndicated loan market. A number of electronic trading platforms are also trying to upend the way corporate bonds are traded. Pandit declined to comment through his spokeswoman, Shannon Bell. Dana Andreoli, a spokeswoman for Victory Park who works at Edelman, declined to comment. A QED representative didn\u2019t immediately comment. The loan market has been slow to adopt new technology, with the vast majority of issuance still undertaken through a complex network of contacts and with many deals struck by phone and even settled by fax. Buying loans through the MMKT exchange would be cheaper than paying fees charged by syndicate desks who have long worked to distribute such loans to investors, according to Tannenbaum. \u201cThere\u2019s this tight club of 50 to 100 lenders that sell to each other and everybody knows that,\u201d said Tannenbaum, interim chief executive officer and chairman of MMKT. \u201cThe family offices don\u2019t have access to our deals. It\u2019s all clubbed up. What if we went beyond the club?\u201d The loan market has been booming in recent years as low interest rates encouraged yield-starved investors to snap up riskier corporate debt. That has sparked intense competition between non-bank entities, big lenders and private-equity firms in underwriting and distributing the debt. The amount of loans issued by middle-market companies in the U.S. rose to $15.02 billion in 2014 from the $13.4 billion a year earlier, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary & Data. \u201cIf you\u2019re a QIB \u2013 a qualified investor with over $100 million \u2013 why pay 2/20 when you can buy direct to build your own portfolio with a small fee to MMKT,\u201d Tannenbaum said, referring to the 2 percent management and 20 percent performance fees charged by many investment funds. Pandit has invested in several financial technology startups including Orchard, which provides data and analytics for peer-to-peer lenders such as LendingClub Corp. and Prosper Marketplace Inc. Ron Suber, a former Wells Fargo & Co. executive and president of Prosper, is another investor in MMKT, said the person. Suber declined to comment. Tannenbaum said that while MMKT is initially focused on the primary market where new loans are sold, it aims to expand into trading existing loans.

Six U.K. Teenagers Arrested in Website Attacks on Amazon, Sony Six British teenagers were arrested for allegedly using hacker-for-hire services in an attempt to take down corporate websites. The operation targeted users of an online service called Lizard Stresser, which offered to carry out \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks in exchange for bitcoins, the U.K. National Crime Agency said. Among the companies hacked were Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp., according to a person familiar with the investigation. The service was created by a hacking group known as Lizard Squad, the agency said. Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for disrupting Microsoft\u2019s Xbox and Sony PlayStation online services on Christmas Day. Cybercriminals are selling increasingly sophisticated viruses and hacking services online while police are hampered by the use of cryptocurrencies and anonymous servers to avoid detection.

Sarao, who is subject to strict bail conditions, asked a London judge for more time to prepare an expert report on trading. The judge rejected the request, saying the issue was irrelevant to the question of extradition. The 36-year-old Sarao was arrested in April in London and charged by U.S. prosecutors with fraud and market manipulation. Authorities said he was responsible for one in five sell orders during the frenzy on May 6, 2010, when investors saw almost $1 trillion erased from U.S. stocks in minutes. Sarao\u2019s lawyer argued that expert evidence was needed to show whether Sarao had made false representations through his trading. Judge Quentin Purdy said that was a question for trial. For purposes of extradition, the focus is whether the U.S. charges would also be offenses under U.K. law, Purdy said.

Long story short -- he ended up purchasing a two-slice Hamilton Beach toaster oven and a Timex watch from Overstock.com, soon after the web retailer announced it would accept payment in bitcoin. After concluding that few Manhattan businesses other than chiropractors, acupuncturists and lawyers accept the virtual currency, he traveled to Boston and managed, with great effort, to use his bitcoin to pay for dinner at a sushi restaurant called Thelonious Monkfish. Finally he returned to Overstock.com to buy \u201cunderpants, water glasses and slippers.\u201d The only place to find plentiful bitcoin-buying opportunities, Sella concluded, was on what remained of Silk Road, the underground Internet marketplace targeted by U.S. prosecutors a year ago for allegedly enabling the sale of drugs, guns, hacker software and other illegal items. The libertarian utopian idyll of bitcoin continues to clash with life\u2019s uglier realities. As Kristen Schweizer reports today, bitcoin has become a significant payment source for those buying and selling child pornography. The U.K.-based Internet Watch Foundation says almost 200 child-porn websites accept bitcoin, including 30 that accept no other form of payment. \u201cProponents applaud the decentralized currency for its promise of anonymity, absence of banking fees, and position on the fringes of the financial industry,\u201d Schweizer writes. \u201cBut those same attributes make it appeal to the underworld.\u201d She quotes Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, saying that traders of child porn \u201cshould burn in hell,\u201d a sentiment that perhaps we all can agree on. Beyond that, it\u2019s hard to see how bitcoin can claim to make both anonymity and decency its top priority. Perversions that target children existed long before bitcoin, of course, and money is only a component in the overall tragedy of child abuse. Still, to get a sense of how bitcoin might be turning the tide in favor of the abusers, read Schweizer\u2019s July 29 story on how the cooperation of financial companies such as Western Union, PayPal, Visa and MasterCard had all but ended sale of child pornography via the public Internet. Those traditional -- old-fashioned, boring perhaps -- financial companies stepped up.

Tom Moroney, in his latest \u201cA Day\u2019s Work\u201d column, introduces us to Isabel Hernandez, a resident of McAllen, Texas, who speaks no English and should -- strictly speaking, from a legal perspective -- be back in Mexico. Her visa expired in 2012, making her one of an estimated 1.8 million undocumented Texas immigrants. If her chosen path toward the American dream seems unlikely and anachronistic -- membership in Avon, \u201cthe lipstick-and-makeup brigade that has been marching through America\u2019s neighborhoods since 1886,\u201d as Moroney puts it -- then consider that: - The top 10 U.S. Avon districts are mostly Hispanic. - A large chunk of Avon sales reps are Hispanic. - The \u201cAvon superstar\u201d who brought Hernandez into her selling empire, Silvia Tamayo, is a Mexican immigrant (and now a U.S. citizen) who made $250,000 in her best year. (Hernandez, by contrast, makes about $100 every two weeks.) - Pablo Munoz, president of Avon North America, said in February that the company would have avoided some of its problems had it focused earlier on Hispanic customers. About those problems: Avon\u2019s sales force has diminished by roughly half, to 300,000, in the past 10 years, and its stock has dropped 32 percent this year. As Moroney writes, \u201cIt is difficult to imagine a single American corporation and individual who need each more than these two.\u201d *** Sounds like there\u2019s a fascinating show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It collects works in bas relief, furniture, jewelry and other objets d\u2019art that depict life in Assyria -- consisting of parts of modern-day Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey -- dating from around the 7th century B.C., Manuela Hoelterhoff reports. Narratives relay the accounts of feasts and warring, and how the empire of the day flourished. But that\u2019s not the point. The point is the damn hot dog carts. In one of her funnier stories in recent memory, the Pulitzer Prize-winning arts-and-culture editor takes us down a normal narrative for one of her reviews, dazzling us with her ability to toss around knowing references to some of the most ancient art and history, before the piece lurches off the rails and gets right up in NYC\u2019s business. \u201cFascinating landscape photographs and illuminating maps dramatize the complex planning and sense of adventure that sent entire armies to distant places. And all without GPS and the certainty of hot dog vendors along the long way.\u201d Wait, what? We stop learning arcane facts about Assyria and start learning arcane facts about a Civil War-era New York law that allows military veterans to sell things on the perimeters of parks. The Met sits inside the boundaries of Central Park, and the carts have turned the front of the one of the most august buildings in the city, if not the nation, into what looks and smells like the parking lot at a Jets game. We haven\u2019t been to the Met in a few years, but we have no recollection of what she\u2019s describing, so things must have changed recently. She says she counted 21 food vendors on the apron of the museum. How can 21 of them in the same spot make a living? And how many of them are from what was Assyria? *** \u201cAlexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\u201d is the kind of movie we loved around age 9 to 11.

Witty banter, some stuff gets broken, hilarity ensues. Alexander is a kid of about that age, Steve Carrell and Jennifer Garner are his parents, there are some siblings. All of them, not just Alex, are screwing up this particular day in epic fashion. If it\u2019s your weekend with the kids and it looks like rain, this will probably make them laugh. Which will make cocktail hour that much more enjoyable. By now you\u2019ve seen the ads for \u201cThe Judge,\u201d which strikes us from the trailer as something that will take dead aim at Oscar nominations and miss by a fairly wide margin. It\u2019s just looks too precious, from its art design and mood lighting to the heavyweight cast to the sweep of a predictable story arc. To wit: Robert Duvall, looking like an older version of \u201cThe Great Santini,\u201d is a cold, seeming loveless, impossibly demanding jurist who has a brittle relationship with his once prodigal son, played by Robert Downey Jr. Downey is now a hot-shot criminal attorney who overcomes the gulf in their relationship to defend his father when the old man -- now a defendant -- is charged with killing someone with his car. And Billy Bob Thornton is the unctuous prosecutor who can\u2019t wait to take the judge down. \u201cAddicted\u201d has a whiff of mommy porn to it, with impossibly gorgeous people -- one of them being the former Ralph Lauren Polo supermodel Tyson Beckford -- coursing through lusty intrigues of a wife\u2019s infidelity.

He faced as long as 71 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines, according to a report by U.S. probation officials. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, asked for probation. In Manhattan federal court today, Shrem quoted Spider-Man and said he wanted to remain free to make sure others don\u2019t commit crimes using the virtual currency he described as his \u201cbaby.\u201d \u201cI screwed up,\u201d Shrem told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff. \u201cThe bitcoin community, they\u2019re scared and there is no money laundering going on any more. They\u2019re terrified. Bitcoin is my baby, it\u2019s my whole world and my whole life, it\u2019s what I was put on this earth to do. I need to be out there. If your honor grants me that, I can be out there in the world, making sure that people don\u2019t do the same stupid things that I did.\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner disputed Agnifilo\u2019s argument that Shrem\u2019s crimes were a momentary youthful lapse. He said federal investigators inadvertently stumbled upon Shrem\u2019s case after a related probe, while explaining that such cases are hard to prosecute with limited resources. \u201cUnless these businesses get the message that these laws are not a joke, the court will lose a valuable opportunity to help promote the legitimacy of the these businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be a substantial prison sentence.\u201d Rakoff, who ordered Shrem to forfeit almost $1 million, said he committed a serious crime and that a prison term is warranted. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Mr. Shrem, over a period of many months, was knowingly, willfully, to some extent excitedly and even passionately involved in activities he knew were, in part, involved in serious violations of the law,\u201d the judge said. The case is part of a crackdown by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara on Silk Road, a sprawling and anonymous black market bazaar. Bharara has previously charged Ross William Ulbricht with running the $1.2 billion Internet marketplace under the alias \u201cDread Pirate Roberts.\u201d Both Shrem, who was vice chairman of the Bitcoin foundation, and Robert Faiella, who operated the BTCKing exchange, were charged in April with a scheme to launder more than $1 million in the virtual currency tied to transactions on Silk Road. A trial was scheduled to begin this month. Faiella also pleaded guilty to running an illegal money business and awaits sentencing. Shrem, who was also chief executive officer of a Bitcoin exchange called BitInstant, was arrested in January when he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York after giving a speech in Amsterdam about bitcoins. Ulbricht, who pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to go to trial in January. Shrem was allowed to surrender to federal prison in March.

He faced as long as 71 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines, according to a report by U.S. probation officials. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, asked for probation. In Manhattan federal court today, Shrem quoted Spider-Man and said he wanted to remain free to make sure others don\u2019t commit crimes using the virtual currency he described as his \u201cbaby.\u201d \u201cI screwed up,\u201d Shrem told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff. \u201cThe bitcoin community, they\u2019re scared and there is no money laundering going on any more. They\u2019re terrified. Bitcoin is my baby, it\u2019s my whole world and my whole life, it\u2019s what I was put on this earth to do. I need to be out there. If your honor grants me that, I can be out there in the world, making sure that people don\u2019t do the same stupid things that I did.\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner disputed Agnifilo\u2019s argument that Shrem\u2019s crimes were a momentary youthful lapse. He said federal investigators inadvertently stumbled upon Shrem\u2019s case after a related probe, while explaining that such cases are hard to prosecute with limited resources. \u201cUnless these businesses get the message that these laws are not a joke, the court will lose a valuable opportunity to help promote the legitimacy of the these businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be a substantial prison sentence.\u201d Rakoff, who ordered Shrem to forfeit almost $1 million, said he committed a serious crime and that a prison term is warranted. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Mr. Shrem, over a period of many months, was knowingly, willfully, to some extent excitedly and even passionately involved in activities he knew were, in part, involved in serious violations of the law,\u201d the judge said. The case is part of a crackdown by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara on Silk Road, a sprawling and anonymous black market bazaar. Bharara has previously charged Ross William Ulbricht with running the $1.2 billion Internet marketplace under the alias \u201cDread Pirate Roberts.\u201d Both Shrem, who was vice chairman of the Bitcoin foundation, and Robert Faiella, who operated the BTCKing exchange, were charged in April with a scheme to launder more than $1 million in the virtual currency tied to transactions on Silk Road. A trial was scheduled to begin this month. Faiella also pleaded guilty to running an illegal money business and awaits sentencing. Shrem, who was also chief executive officer of a Bitcoin exchange called BitInstant, was arrested in January when he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York after giving a speech in Amsterdam about bitcoins. Ulbricht, who pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to go to trial in January. Shrem was allowed to surrender to federal prison in March.

Apple Pay, a feature unveiled yesterday alongside a fresh crop of gadgets from the Cupertino, California-based company, uses sensors to let people pay for goods and services by swiping their smartphones. Apple forged alliances with Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and American Express Co. to boost the use of mobile devices for shopping. While EBay Inc.\u2019s PayPal, Square Inc. and Stripe Inc. have all indicated that they\u2019re ready to link their payment services to Apple Pay, they could also see customers relying less on their technology, or struggle to attract new users. Still, the opportunity in the mobile-transaction market remains huge, according to Forrester Research Inc., with payments projected to reach $90 billion in 2017, up from $12.8 billion in 2012. \u201cIf I were PayPal, I\u2019d be worried,\u201d said Denee Carrington, an analyst at Forrester. \u201cIf the experience is better and the consumer perceives it as more secure, it poses a threat to PayPal.\u201d The shares of EBay, which operates PayPal, have declined 5.8 percent since yesterday\u2019s presentation by Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. The stock closed at $51.10 in New York today. Apple is supporting credit and debit cards from Bank of America Corp., Capital One Financial Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and other banks, representing 83 percent of credit-card purchase volume in the U.S., according to Apple. Bloomingdale\u2019s Inc., Macy\u2019s Inc., McDonald\u2019s Corp. , Sephora USA Inc., Subway Restaurants Inc., Walgreen Co. and Whole Foods Market Inc. and other retailers will also support Apple Pay, the iPhone maker said. Apple, banks, credit-card companies, retailers and mobile-payments providers are all chasing after customers who have become accustomed to paying for coffee, car rides and other transactions with a few taps on their smartphones, instead of pulling out cash or plastic. Consumers will be comfortable trying Apple\u2019s new mobile-payment system because of the partnerships it has forged, Carrington said. Patrick Collison, Stripe\u2019s CEO, said that his startup was already working with Apple so that merchants using its mobile-payments technology will be able to enable transactions via Apple Pay. One of the key design elements of Apple Pay is a wireless computer chip in iPhones that lets people hold their smartphones near a payment terminal in order to complete a sale. \u201cFor Stripe, the opportunity is so obvious -- but it took so long for it to happen,\u201d Collison said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cApple Pay has a really good chance. It\u2019s the first product that\u2019s checked all of the boxes.\u201d Braintree, a unit of PayPal that processes mobile payments, said today that it\u2019s planning to support Apple Pay, so that merchants using its service will be able tap into Apple\u2019s payment technology. \u201cOur millions of sellers will be able to accept any form of payment that comes across the counter, including Apple Pay,\u201d Jack Dorsey, Square\u2019s CEO, tweeted. It wasn\u2019t clear to what extent the mobile-payment providers\u2019 services would be integrated with Apple Pay\u2019s technology, or how they would share in any revenue. Electronic payments have been EBay\u2019s fastest-growing revenue source. PayPal, which has 154 million registered users, will start accepting bitcoins, opening up the world\u2019s second-biggest Internet payment network to virtual currency transactions, the company said Sept. 8.

The Tokyo District Court dismissed the application for civil rehabilitation today and appointed an administrator of the company\u2019s assets in place of Karpeles. Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, filed for bankruptcy protection on Feb. 28, saying it lost 850,000 bitcoins then worth about $500 million. It has since recovered about 200,000. The collapse roiled the bitcoin market, which has also faced recent hurdles such as China banning banks from dealing in the digital assets and the U.S. government\u2019s decision to tax them. \u201cThe liquidation track is probably cleaner than trying to divvy up liabilities between current owners and potential buyers,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. \u201cEspecially potential legal liabilities.\u201d The administrator, lawyer Nobuaki Kobayashi, said in a separate statement that the court will probably order the start of bankruptcy proceedings. How the company is treated will be decided by taking into account factors including whether there is any candidate to buy the business, Kobayashi said. The bitcoin exchange, once the world\u2019s largest, said in its Feb. 28 filing that its debt exceeded assets by 2.7 billion yen ($26 million) and about 2.8 billion yen was also missing from its bank accounts. Any investigation of the liability of Karpeles will be conducted as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Kobayashi said in the statement. \u201cThe dismissal of the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation procedure will create great inconvenience and concerns to our creditors for which we apologize,\u201d Karpeles said.

A Frankfurt-based spokeswoman for Zurich-based Credit Suisse declined to comment.

Prosecutors raided 50 homes and offices in eight German states and Switzerland, Krauth said last month. Stuttgart officials looked into some of the people in 2008.

Japan Yet to Decide on Bitcoin Rules Amid Money-Laundering Risk Japan\u2019s government said it has yet to decide whether to regulate Bitcoin, while highlighting that banks must report any suspicions of money laundering stemming from trades of the digital currency. The government is still collecting information on Bitcoin, it said today in a written response to questions asked by opposition lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo. Banks have a duty to notify authorities if they suspect that customers have been involved in crime or drug dealing, it said. Last month\u2019s bankruptcy of Mt. Gox Co., an online Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, brought the issue of regulating the virtual currency into focus in Japan. Bitcoin has attracted attention from authorities around the world concerned about money laundering. Okubo\u2019s questions centered on the responsibilities of Japanese banks used by Bitcoin exchanges to settle transactions with clients. While Bitcoin isn\u2019t considered a currency in Japan, it could be subject to taxation like goods and services, the government said on March 7 in response to earlier questions from Okubo. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said last week that it plans to regulate virtual-currency intermediaries including operators of Bitcoin exchanges to address potential money-laundering and terrorist-financing risks.

He then went there to see how the money was used. \u201cSome goes to bakeries and hospitals, to operate those hospitals and pay the doctors,\u201d he said by phone last month. \u201cSome goes to the mujahedeen,\u201d the Arabic word for holy warriors. \u201cWe support whoever defends Muslims.\u201d Alajji is among many Sunni Muslim citizens in oil-rich Gulf Arab states who are backing rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, whose Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiite Islam, as the war splits the Middle East along sectarian lines. Kuwaiti citizens alone have raised about $150 million, said former opposition lawmaker Waleed Al-Tabtabai, who helps collect funds. Money is pledged, raised and sent through methods including social media, bank transfers and Bitcoins, according to fundraisers and security and political analysts. It\u2019s often sent to neighboring countries such as Turkey and funneled from there into Syria using the same routes that many fighters take. Gulf aid is helping to counterbalance the money Assad gets from allies such as Iran and Russia, which opponents say he also uses for indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Some private funds are fueling similar violations, according to Human Rights Watch. The group last month reported a massacre of Alawite villagers in August, in which Islamist extremists, including al-Qaeda allies, killed at least 190 civilians in the Mediterranean province of Latakia. The report traced part of the financial support for the campaign to Hajjaj al-Ajmi, a Kuwaiti national, adding there was no evidence that he or the other donors were aware of the atrocities that the militants committed. Al-Ajmi had announced on Twitter a campaign to raise funds for the Popular Committee to Support the Syrian Revolution to help \u201cRescue the Syrian Coast.\u201d Potential donors were asked to use smartphone messaging technology WhatsApp and phone numbers to make pledges, and to visit an address in Ogaela, south of the capital, Kuwait City. Al-Ajmi couldn\u2019t be reached for comment when contacted by phone, including three numbers posted on Twitter. Other Kuwaitis interviewed for this story denied that their fundraising aided extremists. \u201cWe go to any length to make sure\u201d that the money reaches the \u201cright hands,\u201d said Al-Tabtabai. The flow of private money raises dilemmas for countries such as Saudi Arabia. The kingdom wants Assad defeated, and has  expressed impatience with U.S.-led efforts to prevent money going to any but Western-backed groups in Syria, saying those often aren\u2019t the most effective or organized. Yet it\u2019s also been stung by experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, when private money helped train extremists abroad, only to have the jihadists return and wreak havoc at home. As a result, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have sought to restrict financial aid to official channels to keep Islamists at home in check. With state-linked charities, \u201cthere is no possibility of leakage,\u201d Ghanem Nuseibeh, founder of Cornerstone Global Associates, a London-based political and economic research firm, said in a phone interview on Nov. 6. Still, once the money leaves the Gulf, there\u2019s little that officials can do to stop it seeping into Syria, where two years of war have made the borders with Turkey and Lebanon harder to control. At Hatay Airport, in the Turkish province that borders Syria, there were no international flights before the start of the civil war. Now there are several weekly arrivals from Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told by locals here that rich businessmen or clerics from the Gulf countries, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, were coming and handing out cash in bags to charities to purchase humanitarian aid and send it across the border,\u201d Oytun Orhan, an analyst at the Center for Middle Eastern Strategic Studies in Ankara, said by phone from the border area on Nov. 12. \u201cThe same method applies to financial aid for rebels as well.\u201d In Kuwait, where there\u2019s a Shiite minority, the government \u201cseems to want to ensure that it\u2019s allowing people to vent their anger outside of the country through means like funding,\u201d Nuseibeh said. In the case of private charities, tracking where the money ends up is a \u201cmore difficult task because you have to control the upstream and the downstream,\u201d he said. The Kuwaiti government says it\u2019s doing what it can. While there are no specific limits on private transfers, \u201cwe are signatories to money-laundering and terrorist-financing treaties, and we apply that\u201d in all ways, said Sheikh Mohammad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah, the state minister for cabinet affairs, in a phone interview. Asked about Gulf money arriving in Syria, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Nov. 13 that the U.S. is stressing the need for Kuwait to have a \u201crobust anti-money-laundering/counter-terrorism financing regime.\u201d Rules are also more relaxed in Qatar, according to analysts and fundraisers. \u201cThings are good here in Qatar,\u201d said Alajji, who also promotes funding for the Free Syrian Army and charities through Twitter, when asked if authorities were restricting his efforts to aid Syrians. He declined to disclose the total amount of money he helped raise since the conflict began. \u201cThe state of Qatar stands by all the people affected by catastrophes,\u201d he said. Qatar, among the main backers of anti-Assad groups, gave the Syrian National Coalition control over Assad\u2019s embassy in Doha, and people openly display the green-and-black flag of the opposition group on their cars. Billboards in the capital solicit non-lethal aid for Syria with images of crying children. Donations are also collected in shopping malls. Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry referred requests for comment to the state-run Qatar News Agency, which didn\u2019t respond to e-mailed questions. Along with face-to-face campaigns and bank transfers, fundraisers are increasingly relying on social media websites to collect money. \u201cOne new group of enterprising Jihadi fundraisers even is now trying to use Bitcoins because of its anonymity and wide availability,\u201d said Evan Kohlmann, a senior partner at Flashpoint Partners in New York, referring to the virtual currency that\u2019s designed to be untraceable. Flashpoint offers government agencies and other clients services including analyzing cyber-threats. Kuwait\u2019s Al-Tabtabai defended the principle of sending money to arm the rebels and not just humanitarian aid, saying support from governments isn\u2019t enough to fight Assad\u2019s military. \u201cDo we feed them and treat them just for the regime to go in and kill them?\u201d said Al-Tabtabai, a professor of Islamic law at Kuwait University, who has visited Syria and met with opposition groups. \u201cThey have the right to defend themselves.\u201d Faten Ahmed, a 43-year-old Kuwaiti civil servant who donates through local charities, acknowledges that there are risks involved in donation, and says they\u2019re worth taking. \u201cThere is a chance that the money will be displaced but there is no alternative,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThere is always some sort of a gamble.

Shadow Banking Deals Prompt SEC Plan to Cap Leverage for Brokers U.S. regulators concerned that banks and brokerage firms remain too dependent on risky types of short-term funding are weighing new rules designed to reduce reliance on parts of what is often called the shadow banking system. Now the Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing new funding rules for brokers as well as a limit on leverage similar to those used by the Federal Reserve and other regulators for banks, according to a regulatory document and SEC officials familiar with the matter. The initiatives are aimed at financing tools such as repurchase agreements, or repos, that were relied on by Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. until their failures accelerated the 2008 financial crisis. Fed officials have warned for years that the $4.5 trillion web of repo deals remains prone to unravel during a panic, potentially leading to a wider financial panic. The SEC oversees broker-dealers, the largest of which are owned by big banks supervised by the Fed. The broker-dealer units of banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. would be affected by the proposal, as would firms such as Leucadia National Corp.\u2019s Jefferies Group LLC that aren\u2019t within Fed-regulated holding companies.

Bitcoins currently trade for about $875 each on the Mt.Gox exchange, up from about $13 a year ago. As their value surged, digital prospectors have rushed to create more of the digital money, boosting the market for high-powered machines, some of which cost more than $20,000 apiece.

In yesterday\u2019s hearing, Schumer and others raised questions about the risks of Bitcoin, including a lack of consumer protections and regulations and the currency\u2019s use by criminals. The price of Bitcoin declined 18 percent from Nov. 18 to about $543 yesterday, on exchange Bitstamp. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume Bitcoin will become the next great thing in the financial system,\u201d Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, who also testified on Nov. 18, said at yesterday\u2019s meeting. The comments contrasted with the Nov. 18 hearing, where the U.S. Department of Justice described the digital currency as a \u201clegal means of exchange,\u201d bolstering the prospect of wider acceptance of Bitcoin as an alternative payment system. Introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is being used to pay for everything from Gummi bears to smartphones on the Internet. There are 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks activity across various exchanges. Bitcoins can potentially reduce banking-transaction fees, making it an attractive tender for those seeking to trade via the Web or in stores. Several of those who appeared at yesterday\u2019s hearing suggested ways to beef up Bitcoin protections. Mercedes Kelley Tunstall, a partner at law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, recommended getting rid of features that make Bitcoin transactions anonymous. Bitcoin exchanges and merchants should provide guarantees of redemption and information on a dispute resolution process, Sarah Jane Hughes, a university scholar and fellow in commercial law at the University of Indiana, said at the hearing. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, said many tax issues, such as how to collect sales taxes on Bitcoin transactions, are yet to be clarified. \u201cThis is going to be a big challenge,\u201d Heitkamp said. \u201cThis is going to become an increasing problem.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-19/bitcoin-to-separate-wheat-from-chaff-to-thrive-schumer-says', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 20, 5, 1, 0, 8000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin to \u2018Separate Wheat From Chaff\u2019 to Thrive, Schumer Says'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin prices plunged against the yuan and the dollar after China\u2019s largest online market for the virtual currency stopped accepting Bitcoin deposits and Scandinavian authorities said they will impose regulations. Bitcoin fell as much as 49 percent to 2,011 yuan ($331) on BTC China, which said its payments subsidiary YeePay would no longer offer deposit services. Against the dollar, Bitcoin declined as much as 43 percent on the Bitstamp, an online market where the digital money can be traded for legal tender. Since the digital money isn\u2019t controlled or authorized by any country or banking authority, Bitcoins have also attracted the interest of authorities concerned that they can be used to trade in illicit goods or evade financial controls. While Bitcoins have been around since 2008, their growing use has lured speculators, fueling a rally that drove up the price of the virtual currency more than 80-fold this year. \u201cEvery day brings a new twist and turn,\u201d said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. \u201cLonger term, the technologies that have been introduced, innovations that have been involved in Bitcoin will have a very big impact. What the actual value of Bitcoin is going to be is far harder to determine, particularly since the market is illiquid.\u201d More nations are taking an official stance on virtual currencies. Norway said this month it won\u2019t recognize Bitcoins as legal tender and will impose a capital gains tax. BTC China\u2019s decision to stop taking deposits follows a move by China\u2019s central bank to bar financial institutions and payment companies from handling Bitcoin transactions. \u201cChina represented a lot of the incremental demand for Bitcoin over the last few months,\u201d Luria said. \u201cRemoving that demand lowers the price very substantially, and creates the perception that maybe other countries won\u2019t allow trading.\u201d The Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has said that Bitcoin businesses may be considered money transmitters for the purpose of complying with anti-money laundering laws. The agency sent letters to \u201cabout a dozen\u201d Bitcoin-related businesses last month asking them either to register or explain why they are not subject to its jurisdiction. \u201cFincen often sends letters to banks, credit unions, jeweler, casinos and the like,\u201d said Steve Hudak, a spokesman for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \u201cThis should not be surprising to anyone.\u201d Introduced five years ago by a programmer, or group of programmers, going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoins exist as software and can potentially reduce banking-transaction fees, making it an attractive option for trading via the Web or in stores. Bitcoins are being used to pay for everything from Gummi bears and digital cameras to Tesla electric cars on the Web, with more than 12 million in circulation. The virtual currency gained credibility last month after law enforcement and securities agencies said in U.S. Senate hearings that Bitcoin could be a legitimate means of exchange. The U.S. government shut down in October the Silk Road Hidden Website, where people could obtain guns, drugs and other illicit goods using Bitcoins. That generated optimism the digital money would become more widely used for legal purposes. The price of Bitcoins topped $1,000, and have since dropped to trade around $562 today on Bitstamp, one of the more active online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars and other currencies. The jump in Bitcoin prices prompted former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan this month to call the market a \u201cbubble.\u201d    Denmark is the latest nation to prepare standards to protect its consumers from risks associated with virtual currencies after the regulator found it lacked authority to prevent a company creating an exchange for the software. The most likely outcome would be an \u201camendment to existing financial legislation so that we have regulation covering it,\u201d Michael Landberg, chief legal adviser at the Financial Supervisory Authority in Denmark, said yesterday in a phone interview. \u201cIt is also important to have this included in money laundering acts.\u201d Denmark plans to \u201calign\u201d itself with other nations in designing a framework that deals with gray zones created by the use of Bitcoins and its competitors, Landberg said. The FSA is preparing draft legislation for lawmakers to consider, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll seek to follow the mainstream,\u201d Landberg said. \u201cBitcoins are not forbidden in the U.S. and the U.K. It is out there and will continue to be out there.

Ripple, a San Francisco-based startup, operates payments software and a digital currency that resides in a consumer\u2019s account known as a Ripple Wallet. Under the agreement, Ripple will let consumers link those Wallets to ZipZap accounts. San Francisco-based ZipZap -- which has payment centers across the U.S. in locations such as CVS Caremark Corp. pharmacies and hotels -- can then send a payment that someone makes through their Ripple Wallet to a recipient elsewhere who also has the software. The move puts Ripple in competition with Western Union Co., which typically charges $40 for sending $500 in cash in person from one U.S. location to another in minutes. ZipZap charges a $3.95 fee when customers top up their Ripple Wallet account with as much as $500, according to the company. \u201cIf we have more places an average person can go to and load value, it\u2019s more valuable,\u201d Chris Larsen, chief executive officer of Ripple, said in an interview. \u201cIt goes to utility.\u201d Dan Diaz, a spokesman for Western Union, didn\u2019t return a request for comment. Ripple\u2019s agreement with ZipZap underscores the proliferation of alternative methods of payment. Bitcoin and several dozen other virtual currencies have sprung up in recent years to let users buy everything from luxury cars to cupcakes online and in the real world. Ripple issues a virtual currency known as Ripples, of which it holds a 25 percent slice. Each Ripple Wallet has to hold at least 50 Ripples -- which people pay for using currencies from U.S. dollars to Japanese yen to Bitcoins -- to function. The company\u2019s virtual currency and payments software are intended to make it easy for people to exchange money, loyalty points or airline miles for another currency. Some 27,000 people have Ripple Wallet accounts, Larsen said. \u201cThere\u2019ll still have to be massive adoption,\u201d Ugo Egbunike, senior ETF specialist at index-fund researcher IndexUniverse, said in an interview. \u201cIt might be cheaper than Western Union, but there might be risks.\u201d Ripple was invented and developed by a group of programmers at OpenCoin Inc., now called Ripple Labs.

Bitcoin\u2019s Underlying Technology Seen as Having a Bright Future Investor-backed entrepreneurs are betting that the technology behind Bitcoin can be used for a range of financial tasks now handled by banks, exchanges, e-commerce providers and other middlemen. Invictus Innovations Inc., Ripple Labs Inc. and other startups are harnessing Bitcoin\u2019s underlying code for such tasks as authentication, which means making sure that a buyer isn\u2019t posing as someone else, and verification of payments. If successful, the new tools might reduce the fees shouldered by buyers and sellers in the $1.22 trillion global electronic-commerce market, as well in financial services, cloud computing and other areas.

Coping with currency swings proved apt training for Malka, an entrepreneur cum venture capitalist -- and one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest bulls. The 39-year-old Venezuelan joins higher-profile investors, such as Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson, in betting that the virtual currency will keep gaining traction as a way for people to buy and sell things online. These Bitcoin backers are holding firm even as a barrage of bad news -- including the shutdown of Mt.Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange -- makes others leery of the digital money. \u201cI have no doubt on the future of Bitcoin because the concept of money becoming digital in all shapes and forms is here to stay,\u201d Malka said. Malka began investing in Bitcoins in 2011 to pay a contractor in Argentina and bypass government money-transfer restrictions. He founded venture capital firm Ribbit Capital the following year with $100 million to invest in financial-services startups and Bitcoin companies such as Coinbase Inc. and BTCJam. Andreessen\u2019s Andreessen Horowitz and Wilson\u2019s Union Square Ventures also back Coinbase. Unlike most venture capital firms, Ribbit also invests directly in the virtual currency. Social+Capital Partnership, founded in 2011 by former Facebook Inc. executive Chamath Palihapitiya also invests in Bitcoins. The two firms together control at least 5 percent of the Bitcoins mined, according to Palihapitiya, whose fund is an investor in Ribbit Capital. That indicates that the firms\u2019 holdings may be worth about $360 million at current exchange rates, based on the 12.4 million Bitcoins in existence, according to Bitcoincharts.com, which compiles prices and currency data, and the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. \u201cThere\u2019s more money to be made owning Bitcoins than Bitcoin companies,\u201d said Palihapitiya, whose fund doesn\u2019t directly back Bitcoin companies. He and Malka declined to comment on the value of their holdings. Bitcoin, subject to large swings, can test the mettle even of investors willing to stomach risks. Tokyo-based Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan today amid reports that hackers had pilfered about $473 million in Bitcoin from the exchange. Its shutdown this week had sparked a 10 percent slump in the virtual currency. Introduced in 2008, Bitcoin captured the attention of technologists, investors and governments last year, fueling a rally that drove it to a record of about $1,200 from $12. Scrutiny from regulators, bans in China and India and stumbles by merchants and service providers have fueled volatility and a decline in the value of Bitcoins, which were trading today at $576. Mt.Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the digital money, which provided information to federal prosecutors this week that aided a probe into Mt.Gox. \u201cMt.Gox is the only exchange that wasn\u2019t backed by venture funds or institutional investors,\u201d said Malka, who is on the foundation\u2019s board. \u201cIt will take time for the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem to prove that this is a bad apple and not a problem of the entire ecosystem.\u201d While Malka says there\u2019s a chance the currency will flop, he predicts that more businesses will use the currency as an alternative to traditional means for investing and carrying out transactions. He sees it as a payments system that can serve economies, like Venezuela\u2019s, that restrict the flow of money via capital controls and as a hedge against inflation, like precious metals. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a smooth or overnight success,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial services is the biggest industry which has not been disrupted by technology.\u201d Wilson, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, and Margit Wennmachers, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said their firms remain bullish on Bitcoin. Venture funds have invested $86 million in Bitcoin companies, mostly over the past 12 months, Wedbush Securities Inc. wrote in a Feb. 18 report. Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation, one of the legacies of Hugo Chavez\u2019s 14 years as president, drove Malka to come up with alternative financial services and embrace Bitcoins, he said. \u201cI started my first company much earlier than I planned because I lost my first job in the financial crisis triggered by Chavez\u2019s first failed military coup in 1992,\u201d said Malka, who in 1993 founded bond broker Heptagon Grupo Financiero in Caracas, when he was 19. Malka, who graduated with a degree in economics from the Universidad Cat\xf3lica Andr\xe9s Bello in Caracas, later started five other financial services companies, including Patagon, an online brokerage. Malka and Wences Casares, who co-founded the company, sold Patagon to Banco Santander SA for $750 million in 2000. After running the business in Spain and founding a bank for low-income borrowers in Brazil, Malka moved to San Francisco in 2007 because he \u201cwanted to play in the major leagues,\u201d he said. In 2011, Malka and Casares started Bling Nation Inc., a mobile-payments company. After ditching hardware and focusing on software, the company was re-introduced as Lemon.com, which LifeLock Inc. bought in December for $50 million, they said. Malka then established Ribbit Capital, seeking to invest in technology startups innovating in financial services. Ribbit has so far backed 11 companies including Borro Ltd., which offers cash for luxury goods such as jewelry, watches and cars. Coinbase is an online Bitcoin storage service, while Brazil\u2019s BTCJam lets people borrow from each other using Bitcoin as a benchmark. Directly investing in Bitcoins is an uncommon and risky strategy for a venture capital fund, according to Josh Lerner, a professor of investment banking at Harvard Business School. \u201cVenture capital agreements have strict prohibition on investing in futures and currency,\u201d he said. It\u2019s still a risk worth taking, said Palihapitiya, whose fund has been delivering an average annual return on investment for limited partners of 40 percent to 60 percent since its inception in 2011. \u201cMy LPs don\u2019t care if I invest in Bitcoins or Bitcoin companies, as long as my returns are good,\u201d said Palihapitiya, whose fund has also invested in Bling Nation. Ribbit Capital has done even better, returning 400 percent since its debut, two people with knowledge of the situation said. Malka declined to comment on his fund\u2019s performance. Buying risky assets is more typical of hedge funds, said Lerner. Fortress Investment Group LLC, a New York-based private-equity and hedge-fund manager, said it bought $20 million worth of Bitcoin last year and recorded a paper loss of $3.7 million on the investment, according to a filing today. When venture investor Jeremy Liew was considering whether to back Bitcoin startups, he said he turned to Malka, who has spoken on the virtual currency at five conferences in the past year. \u201cWe were interested in Bitcoin and Micky helped us get up to speed,\u201d said Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners, which is an investor in Malka\u2019s fund. Lightspeed has since backed three Bitcoin companies, including China\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, BTC China, and has seven indirect investments through a Bitcoin incubator that supports early stage startups. While companies and regulators are still debating how to treat Bitcoin, others have embraced it. David Marcus, president of EBay Inc.\u2019s PayPal payments unit, said he finds Bitcoins \u201cfascinating,\u201d and he only invests in the virtual currency with personal funds as a limited partner in Ribbit Capital. PayPal itself won\u2019t offer Bitcoin services until regulatory issues become clearer, Marcus said. \u201cVenture capital is about taking risk, and you can\u2019t be focused on financial services without investing in Bitcoins,\u201d Marcus said of Ribbit\u2019s strategy. \u201cThere are very few venture capitalists focused on financial services, and that makes Malka sharp and truly unique.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-28/bitcoin-bull-malka-holds-firm-as-mt-gox-closing-drags-currency', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 28, 16, 28, 4, 964000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Bull Holds Firm as Mt.

Gox said in a statement. The filing follows three weeks of speculation about the fate of the Tokyo-based exchange, which suspended withdrawals on Feb. 7. Since Bitcoins exist as bits of software, they can be stolen if a hacker gains access to the computers and servers used to run online exchanges, where the virtual currency can be traded for dollars, euros and other currencies. The turmoil left investors and entrepreneurs asking how the insolvency could happen and how the fledgling Bitcoin industry might bounce back. \u201cMt.

Mt.

Mt. Gox lost 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own, for a total of 850,000, the company said. \u201cWe are in a situation close to what you would call Chapter 11 in the U.S.,\u201d Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an e-mail. Karpeles said his company lost the Bitcoins because of weaknesses in its computer systems\u2019 security measures. Since Bitcoins exist as software, any computer or server connected to the Internet that stores those files is vulnerable to unauthorized access. Similar to a hacker copying e-mail, a thief can steal the virtual currency by duplicating the digital security key that lets a user spend it. A standard method of keeping Bitcoins safe is to move the digital money off a Web-connected computer, according to Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer for Blockchain.info, a company that hosts online wallets for Bitcoin storage. An exchange or any other company handling large quantities of Bitcoins could store the bulk of them on a computer or hard drive that isn\u2019t connected to the Internet, an arrangement known as \u201ccold storage.\u201d Mt. Gox probably failed to properly manage its online and offline Bitcoins, Antonopoulos said. Any individual or business can protect Bitcoins by physically moving the software between cold storage, and online, or hot storage, using flash drives. \u201cCold storage is a combination of technology and operational process,\u201d Antonopoulos said in an e-mail. \u201cThey got some part of that wrong.\u201d Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has since gained traction with merchants around the world. The digital currency has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify transactions. Akio Shinomiya, a lawyer for Mt. Gox, said the court will notify creditors identified by the exchange in its bankruptcy filing. Other creditors will have to make a claim themselves, and then the court would decide who gets repaid. The company also set up a call center to answer customers\u2019 questions about the bankruptcy. Companies from San Francisco to London as well as the virtual currency\u2019s industry group, the Bitcoin Foundation, have been seeking to assure Bitcoin users that their funds won\u2019t disappear due to theft or mismanagement. U.S. and Japanese prosecutors have opened investigations into events leading to the shutdown and bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, and U.S. regulators are exploring options for increasing regulation of virtual currencies. The European Banking Authority, set up in 2011 to harmonize banking rules across the 28-member European Union, said today that it would set up a task force in the first half of this year to review options for regulating Bitcoin and Bitcoin derivatives. One Bitcoin user filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in federal court in Chicago, seeking to represent U.S. customers who lost money. \u201cThis catastrophic loss has not only revealed the instability of a burgeoning new industry, it has also uncovered a massive scheme to defraud millions of consumers into providing a private company with real, paper money in exchange for virtual currency,\u201d Illinois resident Gregory Greene said in the complaint filed yesterday.

This time, it was Chinese trade data \u2014 imports fell for a 13th straight month \u2014 while\xa0a larger-than-expected decline in foreign-exchange reserves underscored the global demand slump that\u2019s helped torpedo\xa0energy and metals prices.

The China data sent mining stocks tumbling and news that Anglo American PLC will suspend its dividend in the second half of 2015 and next year only made things worse. The global mining company\xa0also\xa0pledged deeper spending cuts to help withstand the\xa0collapse in commodities. "We think it\u2019s the right thing to do to make sure the company remains in good shape,\u201d said CEO\xa0Mark Cutifani.\xa0The last time Anglo cut its dividend, during the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009, the shares plunged 17 percent in one day. Today, the stock\xa0plummeted to a new record low.\xa0 Euro-area growth in the third quarter\xa0rose\xa00.3 percent, versus a 0.4 percent gain the prior quarter,\xa0bolstered by private consumption and government spending, while\xa0exports suffered from a slowdown in global trade. Says one economist at Berenberg Bank: "We have a dent caused by emerging markets, but the risk has lessened." But Angus Deaton, winner of this year\u2019s Nobel economics prize, begs to differ. He says Europe\u2019s economic prospects are worsening as the region struggles to absorb the wave of asylum seekers.\xa0Across the pond, bets\xa0the Federal Reserve will end the era of near-zero borrowing costs at its Dec. 16 meeting have risen\xa0to 78 percent.\xa0 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. dropped 6.6 percent in\xa0late trading after saying it\xa0closed\xa0a restaurant in Boston following complaints of illness from more than two dozen college students.

Ask them how to achieve that end, and you\u2019ll likely get nine different answers. The list of questions below aren\u2019t the only questions that will shape life on Main Street next year, but they\u2019re among the biggest that people involved with small companies will be keeping on their radar. Will Main Street start to get some certainty on health care?\n      We\u2019re often told that uncertainty regarding the effects of the Affordable Care Act has been a drag on small business growth. The rocky launch of Obamacare\u2019s online health care exchanges led the White House to announce last week that it will ease rules requiring all Americans to carry health insurance beginning next year. The employer mandate and the federal\xa0Small Business Health Options Program\xa0(SHOP) have also suffered setbacks, though an early look at New Mexico\u2019s SHOP exchange showed promise\xa0for a few. It should be noted that small business owners have been dealing with hard-to-predict health-care costs since before the ACA. The bungled rollout means many small business owners and self-employed workers won\u2019t have to embrace Obamacare until 2015. Will President Obama ever get around to naming a new SBA chief?\n      Karen Mills announced her resignation as head of the Small Business Administration in February and left the agency at the end of August. That means President Obama has had either four or 10 months to name a replacement, depending on how you count. Critics have used the prolonged vacancy to argue that Main Street is a low priority for the Obama Administration. Putting political jabs (and conspiracy theories) aside, it would be nice to know why the process is taking so long. Meanwhile, the SBA appeared to do a good job preparing for and recovering from the government shutdown under acting boss Jeanne Hulit. Does the absence of a Senate-confirmed SBA chief even matter? Can anyone solve equity crowdfunding\u2019s \u201cquality\u201d predicament?\n      Investor advocates worry\xa0that when equity crowdfunding becomes legal, the best startups will continue to raise money from angel investors and VC funds. That would make crowdfunding even more risky for investors because they\u2019d be buying shares in second- and third-tier companies that are more likely to go bust. The investor-protection crowd argues the \u201cquality\u201d problem demonstrates the need for stricter regulation. Proponents of crowdfunding, on the other hand, worry that rules intended to protect investors will scare off high-quality startups. If portals can\u2019t offer promising companies, investors will lose money\u2014and ultimately, interest. Here\u2019s hoping that rule-makers can resolve the tension eventually. For all the difficulties in making equity crowdfunding work, it has the potential to be a boon to startups such as those owned by women, often ignored by traditional investors. Will alternative lending get less expensive? \n      Bank lending to small businesses is still down since the financial crisis\u2014and for reasons that have been well-explored: As banks pulled back, alternative lenders stepped into the void, offering more accessible credit, though often at astronomical rates. The U.S. market for merchant cash advances, a particularly expensive form of credit, was about $1 billion in 2013 (PDF), compared to $30 billion in SBA loans that were issued this year. Increasingly, new players in the alternative lending market have sought to distinguish themselves by charging less-expensive rates. Peer-to-peer lenders may finally make an impact next year on the small business credit market, offering an additional source of non-bank loans with more affordable rates. Alternatives are always going to be more expensive than government-backed loans; perhaps competition will push rates down for businesses that get turned down by banks. Will the online sales tax finally pass Congress? And if so, will compliance be as easy and cheap for small businesses as proponents of the bill claim? Some Main Street shops are getting publicity by accepting Bitcoin.Will putting out the crypto-anarchist shingle turn out to be more than a way to win media attention? Spending cuts and a partial shutdown of the federal government made 2013 a tough year for small contractors.\xa0Are small contractors prepared to weather the second year of sequestration? Recreational marijuana will be legal in Washington State and Colorado. That\u2019s going to mean sales for retailers and growers\u2014but also for a host of other businesses that finance, supply, and service the legalized-pot industry.

But if the dealer pays you in Bitcoins, the government may seize them from you someday when you least expect it. This is Bitcoin\u2019s nemo dat quod non habet problem, that being Latin for an old principle of English common law: \u201cNo one gives what he does not have.\u201d If the drug lord didn\u2019t legitimately own the Bitcoins in question because he got them via crime, then he can\u2019t legitimately give them to you. You must give them up even if you\u2019re not at fault. The same principle is at play when certain unwitting art buyers are forced to surrender works that were seized by the Nazis in World War II. Alex Daley, a Microsoft veteran and chief technology strategist at Casey Research, covered nemo dat in a wide-ranging recent essay, which attacked a boosterish piece by Bitcoin investor Marc Andreessen that appeared in the New York Times last month. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop the government from attempting to seize all those ill-gotten coins, even multiple stages down the line?\u201d Daley wrote. This is a good thing if your main concern is cracking down on crime, but not so good if you want Bitcoin to be a reliable means of payment. Daley doesn\u2019t really believe the feds will go after innocent gardeners. But he does think the FBI will seize Bitcoins directly involved in crime, which could quickly add up to a big share of the digital currency. \u201cThe FBI already owns 5 to 10\xa0percent of them, which are now out of circulation,\u201d Daley said in an interview. (He spoke today on Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and me\u2014here\u2019s an unofficial transcript\u2014and I called him up afterward for more information.)  Bitcoins, like bearer bonds, belong to whoever has possession. But the government can still trace them\u2014and will if theft and fraud become big enough problems, according to Daley. Even Bitcoins that have been run through a tumbler to erase their identity have been successfully traced in a computer science experiment, he says. There is a legal niche for a technology like Bitcoin, but Daley says he\u2019s not sure that Bitcoin itself will end up filling it. \u201cBitcoin has gotten too popular, too fast,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has exposed its warts, scaring a lot of people.\u201d Zerocoin, a competitor to Bitcoin, is more anonymous so likely to be more popular with criminals. But Daley sees limits there, too: \u201cZerocoin isn\u2019t going to be the thing to knock it out. It will be driven out by something legitimate.\u201d For another look at nemo dat, read this blog post from the Law Office of R.J. Cronk.

But a new study by Cisco Systems shows that consumers around the world may be more amenable to the autonomous vehicle than has been thought. In a global survey of 1,514 consumers aged 18 or older, Cisco found that 57 percent would put their trust in a driverless vehicle. The answers vary wildly depending on country, with 95 percent of Brazilians embracing the concept of a silicon chauffeur. In Japan, skepticism is still very high, with only 28 percent willing to give up direct control of their cars. In the U.S., where many of these autonomous vehicle technologies are being tested, acceptance is above the global average, at 60 percent. What\u2019s more, the Americans surveyed weren\u2019t a bunch of wild risk-takers: Some 48 percent said they would trust a driverless car to ferry around their children. In general, western Europe is less accepting of vehicle autonomy than North America is, and such rapidly developing regions of the world as India and China are more enthusiastic. Consumer perception of a technology depends largely on how it\u2019s presented. Tesla founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk made that very point last week, when he outlined Tesla\u2019s future autonomous vehicle plans. Musk said he didn\u2019t like the connotations of the term \u201cdriverless car\u201d because it implies a complete ceding of control. Musk\u2019s term of choice is \u201cautopilot.\u201d According to Andreas Mai, Cisco\u2019s director of product management for smart connected vehicles, the survey didn\u2019t sugarcoat its question. The exact text: \u201cImagine a car on the road that is controlled entirely by technology and requires no human driver (i.e. Johnny Cab from Total Recall). How likely would you be to ride in such a car?\u201d I\u2019m generally a proponent of connected car technologies and look forward to the day when advanced sensors and ad hoc wireless networking largely automate my daily commute. But I have to say that if presented with that question on Cisco\u2019s survey, my answer would be \u201cno.\u201d I would be willing to give my car autonomy in many situations, but the idea of being reduced entirely to passenger status doesn\u2019t sit well with me. If Cisco\u2019s survey is truly representative of the public\u2019s current mindset, then we\u2019re a lot closer to creating a driverless highway network than I ever imagined. (For information on the connected car, see GigaOM\u2019s infographic.) As with any industry-produced survey, approach Cisco\u2019s numbers with healthy skepticism. Cisco isn\u2019t Ford or Google, but it has some skin in this game. It produces the security software and router hardware that would be used to deliver connected and autonomous car services. Still, Cisco tends to produce very thorough industry reports, such as its Visual Networking Index of Internet traffic. The company asked interesting questions in its survey. For instance, it found that consumers are eager to connect their vehicles to the Internet of things if they can get tangible benefits. Seventy-four percent of those surveyed said they would allow remote monitoring of their driving habits if it produced savings on insurance premiums or auto repair bills. A further 64 percent said they would be willing to share personal information such as height, weight, and entertainment preferences to create unique driver profiles. A car could then recognize a specific driver by voice imprint, automatically adjust the steering column and seat position, and tune the entertainment system to favorite presets. A surprising 60 percent said they would even provide their automaker or a third-party company with sensitive biometric information such as fingerprints or DNA, if it could help make their vehicles secure.

But the case probably doesn\u2019t point to an easy road forward in authorities\u2019 increasing attempts to bring virtual currencies under their control. Targets such as Liberty Reserve and HSBC, the bank that agreed to pay a $1.92 billion fine to settle charges of money laundering in December, present fairly straightforward options for enforcement; it\u2019s less clear what the federal government would do if it decided that Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most prominent virtual currency, poses a similar threat. The indictment of Liberty Reserve\u2019s alleged masterminds makes it seem as if they were destined to get caught. Three of those named by prosecutors are described as collaborators on a previous virtual-currency venture, Gold Inc., which ran afoul of money laundering laws in 2006. In renouncing his U.S. citizenship after moving to Costa Rica, Arthur Budovsky, one of Liberty Reserve\u2019s alleged founders, felt the need to disclose that he was doing so because his new life \u201cmight open him up to liability in the U.S.,\u201d according to the indictment. Suspicious Costa Rican authorities eventually denied Liberty the licenses it needed to operate legally, prosecutors said, so Budovsky and others reported that they had closed up shop\u2014and then kept operating through shell companies, which evidently didn\u2019t fool anyone. \u201cThis is an immensely profound case as regards to the future operation of online currencies,\u201d said V. Gerard Comizio, an attorney\xa0at Paul Hastings and a former lawyer for federal banking regulators. \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d he said in interview, \u201cthis was the gang that can\u2019t shoot straight.\u201d Incompetence is not the only factor that made Liberty Reserve an easy mark. Let\u2019s face it: Law-enforcement officials know how to go after a few guys in Costa Rica whose primary business, according to prosecutors, is helping criminals launder money. To get money into or out of Liberty Reserve\u2019s system, people would send currency to exchangers in such places as Vietnam or Nigeria, where the\xa0 sum would be turned into credits on Liberty Reserve\u2019s virtual-currency network. For transactions within the network, Liberty Reserve charged a 1 percent commission, with an extra 75\xa2 per transaction if users wanted to hide their Liberty Reserve account numbers. The scheme bears a lot of resemblance to classic money laundering cases, said Comizio, in which\xa0cash is funneled through poorly regulated jurisdictions to obscure its origins. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a digital native designed from its inception to be both untraceable and decentralized. It was programmed specifically to avoid having a core group of people who might be targeted as Budovsky and his alleged co-conspirators were. Bitcoin does have vulnerabilities. One potential choke point is exchanges through which Bitcoin can be converted into traditional currencies, and vice-versa. In March, the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued rules on virtual currencies requiring these exchanges to register with the government. A court order also halted transfers to Mt. Gox, a popular Bitcoin exchange. Those who operate virtual currencies are feeling the\xa0pressure from Washington. Companies such as Perfect Money and WebMoney have stopped accepting customers in the United States, and some companies are shying away from doing business with Bitcoin exchanges. Also at issue are how regulations could affect consumer Internet companies such as Facebook, EBay, and Amazon, which have their own versions of virtual money. The federal government has not indicated that it sees Bitcoin in the same light that it viewed Liberty Reserve. But it is distinct from some other virtual currencies in that basic appeal lies in its anonymity, which will inevitably appeal to people who have something to hide. If it does, a federal crackdown won\u2019t be as easy as arresting a few ex-pats.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-29/for-virtual-currency-cops-liberty-reserve-was-the-easy-part', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 5, 29, 19, 51, 39, 328000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'For Virtual-Currency Cops, Liberty Reserve Was the Easy Part'}, {'articleText': u' After the Senate passed its immigration reform bill last week, Christina Farr gathered the immigration stories of five startup founders.

Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer has been snapping up companies so quickly that it\u2019s almost hard to keep track of them all: In just the past week, deals have been announced for three companies\u2014Qwiki, something called BigNoggin, and Xobni\u2014with a total cost estimated at more than $100 million. Xobni, an e-mail inbox-management service that has been around since 2006, was Mayer\u2019s most recent purchase, with an estimated price tag somewhere between $30 million and more than $60 million. Behind the shopping spree, is there a strategy tying these acquisitions together? One obvious answer is mobile, something Mayer said early on would be a major focus as the company tries to revitalize its faded business: Of the 17 acquisitions Yahoo has announced since she took over the chief executive job, many have something to do with mobile. Qwiki, for example\u2014which the company bought for an estimated $50 million earlier this week\u2014is a service that allows users to create videos on their phones. Other purchases, however\u2014such as the $1 billion acquisition of Tumblr, and even the acquisition of Xobni itself\u2014aren\u2019t so obviously about mobile. The Tumblr deal seemed designed, at least in part, to restore some luster to Yahoo\u2019s reputation as a cool Web company and to try to generate more traffic for its advertising properties. Xobni is clearly meant to help Yahoo\u2019s mail product improve. Yet the company has been languishing on the sidelines of the tech sector for some time now (as has Qwiki). To some extent, that deal seems to be about trying to catch up with Microsoft and Google on features. That\u2019s one of the problems with many Yahoo acquisitions: They seem to be attempts by Mayer to get Yahoo caught up to other major players\u2014a strategy that rarely comes with a big payoff. Is the addition of Xobni going to cause dramatically large numbers of people to switch to Yahoo Mail, or to remain with Yahoo Mail instead of switching to Google or some other service? At worst, this kind of approach could easily create a sort of \u201cFranken-Yahoo,\u201d with disparate parts that fit together but don\u2019t work very well. Adding services such as Qwiki could generate heat and light for Yahoo\u2019s mobile efforts. So could such acquisitions as news-summarization app Summly, for which Yahoo paid an estimated $30 million, despite an utter lack of revenue, let alone profits. At the same time, the frenzy of deals seems to be more like a scattershot \u201cbuy anything that says mobile in its feature set\u201d approach than one guided by an overall vision of what Yahoo wants to become on phones and tablets. As Om Malik pointed out recently, Mayer has the luxury of a deep pocketbook with which to finance the spending spree: Alibaba, the Chinese portal in which Yahoo holds a 23 percent stake, has continued to increase in value and might be worth as much as $100 billion; together with hopes for improved performance under Mayer, this has helped Yahoo\u2019s stock price improve over the past six months. The acquisition binge may well continue. Yahoo has suggested that many of its acquisitions have been about acqui-hiring\u2014adding smart developers and entrepreneurs to its staff, presumably to inject fresh blood into the company and its businesses. However, Om has also argued in the past that Mayer and her acquisitions probably can\u2019t change Yahoo\u2019s core DNA, a cultural miasma that has stymied the efforts of several preceding CEOs and made the company a synonym for snatching failure from the jaws of victory. Can the former Googler stitch the startups she has acquired into something approaching a winning strategy? That remains a rather large question mark.

The founder of early Web news network CNET, sold to\xa0CBS in 2008 for $1.8 billion, Minor also invested early in companies such as\xa0Salesforce.com and Grand Central, which later became Google Voice. With a fortune once estimated at $400 million, he owned four homes around the country, including a former museum near Colonial Williamsburg, Va., and a neoclassical mansion in San Francisco\u2019s tony Pacific Heights. A history of lavish spending and impetuous management caught up with him. Minor took out large loans for such extravagances as hotels, thoroughbred horses, and an art collection that included paintings by Richard Prince and a sculpture by Jeff Koons. When the banks supplying his capital got into trouble during the financial crisis, so did he. Minor declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy in Los Angeles last year, reporting assets of $50 million and $100 million in debt. Now Minor, 49, is attempting a comeback via a technology with its own set of problems: Bitcoin. He\u2019s the founder and executive chairman of Bitreserve, which seeks to use the virtual currency to transfer funds across borders and minimize exchange fees. As he pursues redemption, Minor is also talking about his mistakes and personal turmoil. \u201cI went through six years of depression,\u201d he says, describing himself as acutely depressed. For years, Minor says, he was taking considerable medication for his illness in an effort to avoid self-harm. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe to someone who has not been through what I went through, but my only goal was to get through this part of my life alive,\u201d he says. In part, Minor blames the unpredictable financial crisis for his personal calamity. Doomed institutions\xa0Merrill Lynch and Silverton Bank called in his loans at the worst possible time, he says. Before that came his 2005 divorce, which separated him from his children and, among other things, divided his assets in half. Missing the kids also triggered unresolved issues surrounding his biological father\u2019s disappearance from his life when he was seven months old, he says. As for his personal lifestyle, he says: \u201cI took risks I didn\u2019t otherwise need to take. I didn\u2019t need to take a $23 million loan for art. The great difference between my mistake and the banks\u2019 is that I actually had to pay for mine.\u201d Minor says he fell out of touch with friends and colleagues for six years that \u201care like a fog.\u201d He lived in Los Angeles with his second wife and their four kids, most recently in a rented house in Beverly Hills. He would return to San Francisco when he had custody of his three children from his first marriage. \u201cUltimately I started carrying around a sleeping pill,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there was a chance I might do something, I would knock myself out and go to sleep.\u201d He stopped drinking in 2006; last year, he stopped taking antidepressants and started to feel healthy again. He says his personal goal \u201cis to show my children that no matter what happens, you can always come back. When you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d Bitreserve is Minor\u2019s way to address the problems and opportunities he sees with Bitcoin. He says most people will never be comfortable holding the volatile digital currency, which in the past six months has fallen more than 50 percent from a high of more than $1,000. Bitreserve will allow its customers to import Bitcoins, then transfer and hold them as U.S. dollars, British pounds, euros, renminbi, or yen. Users can send money over the Internet without transaction fees and perhaps eventually pay for goods and services through the site.\xa0 Minor\u2019s company intends to make money by charging foreign exchange fees amounting to a few percentage points per transaction and by investing its reserves. Bitreserve also appears to be a means of addressing to some extent what Minor sees as the injustices involved in his own financial collapse. He says Bitreserve will be completely transparent, publishing a real-time balance sheet of its assets and liabilities and every transaction on its network, stripped of identifying information. \xa0Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers will audit the statements quarterly, he says. Unlike Mt. Gox, the leading Bitcoin exchange that went bust earlier this year, Bitreserve won\u2019t be able to hide solvency issues. Transparency \u201callows people to evaluate risk they are taking on,\u201d says Tim Parsa, a former Peace Corps volunteer and onetime filmmaker who is Bitreserve\u2019s chief executive officer. Minor \u201cis trying to get away from the idea of Bitcoin as a currency and focus on it as a payment system,\u201d says Jerry Brito, a professor of finance at George Mason University. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart idea.\u201d Brito, who got an early briefing on the system but isn\u2019t using or invested in it, points out some obvious problems. For now, BitReserve allows people only to transfer Bitcoin into and out of the system. That will make it inaccessible to the very Bitcoin-phobic people Minor is professing to target. There are also some oddities about the company that might give customers pause. Minor is calling it Bitreserve.org, even though it is a for-profit business. He also won\u2019t disclose how much capital he has raised, or from whom. Securities and Exchange Commission filings suggest that Bitreserve has plans to raise $5 million and that the company is headquartered in the Cayman Islands. Minor says it\u2019s a Cayman company with U.S. subsidiaries in South Carolina and Washington State because of confusion as to how the U.S. government will treat Bitcoin. Ultimately, potential Bitreserve customers will have to decide whether they want to trust Halsey Minor. While he has few friends left in Silicon Valley after years of tussling with partners and co-investors, those who remain say he deserves a second chance. \u201cHalsey suffered way more damage than most of us during the financial crisis, and he learned a lot of lasting lessons from that,\u201d says Rob Reid, who founded the Rhapsody music service with Minor\u2019s backing. \u201cIn any event,\xa0depositing at Bitreserve amounts to betting on Halsey as an entrepreneur\u2014not as an investment adviser. Given that he built a Nasdaq 100 company from scratch and helped so many other companies get off the ground, it\u2019s a bet I\u2019m comfortable with. I\u2019ll be depositing my own Bitcoin with him.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/BradStone', 'name': u'Brad Stone', 'twitterhandle': u'BradStone'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-15/halsey-minor-returns-bearing-bitcoins-via-bitreserve', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 5, 15, 15, 21, 37, 402000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Halsey Minor Returns, Bearing Bitcoins'}, {'articleText': u' You\u2019re an entrepreneur, managing the business from your PC. You\u2019re a doting mother, with hundreds of photos of your children on your laptop. Now, if someone seized all those files, how much would you pay to get them back? There\u2019s nothing theoretical about the scenario. Hundreds of thousands of people have had to wrestle with that question as so-called ransomware infections have surged, encrypting billions of documents. Hackers demand hundreds or thousands of dollars to provide the key that unscrambles files so you can view and use them again. One particularly virulent strain, called CryptoWall, has infected about 625,000 systems and encrypted more than 5.25 billion files since mid-March, according to new research from Dell SecureWorks. One desperate U.S. victim paid the hackers $10,000. Most malware is like a pickpocket, taking your valuables before you\u2019re aware of it. CryptoWall and other ransomware is like a mugger: your money or your files. It\u2019s smart, really, because in most cases, your files are most valuable to you. It\u2019s also easy money for hackers, a lot less work than trying to sell 40 million purloined card numbers on the black market, a la the Target breach. Keith Jarvis, a SecureWorks researcher in Atlanta, found that 1,683 CryptoWall victims forked over a total of $1.1 million to the hackers. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on in the back end for these guys, they just sit back and wait for the money to come in,\u201d says Jarvis. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to paw through the data, they don\u2019t have to figure out how to sell it.\u201d The stickup artists have also gotten a lot better at the scam in recent months. Ransomware started surfacing a few years ago, designed to lock your computer screen and demand money to get access back, says Jarvis. It was a bluff, though; the hackers might claim your files were encrypted, but they weren\u2019t. Victims could break the lock with security software. The criminals relied on ignorance and threats of legal action for illegal downloads of movies or pornography to cow people into paying. A more powerful version emerged last September called CryptoLocker, which, as the name suggests, really did encrypt files. If you didn\u2019t pay, you lost your files forever. CryptoLocker spread to more than 530,000 machines, reaping $3 million for the group behind it, according to Fox-IT, before the infrastructure it relied on got taken down as part of a massive law enforcement effort in late May. TDHServices, a small construction company near Houston that specializes in doors and frames, got hit in October. An office worker set the malware loose by clicking on an e-mail attachment, and within 24 hours up to 40,000 files on the company\u2019s server and its cloud backup files were encrypted, says Julian Ramos, TDH\u2019s vice president and the son of the company\u2019s founder. \u201cWe had 15 years\u2019 worth of work in that server,\u201d he says. The screen displayed on the compromised computer had an ominous-looking timer that counted down from 72 hours, the ransom deadline, Ramos remembers. He quickly figured out he wasn\u2019t going to be able to break it, and his father paid the $300 demanded. The thieves kept their end of the bargain and decrypted the company\u2019s files. If they hadn\u2019t, TDHServices might now be out of business. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the threshold is where we would have said no,\u201d Ramos says. \u201cI think we probably would have paid up to every penny we all had, because every file is important.\u201d CryptoWall is the latest ransomware du jour, and it also does the encryption right. Unless you have backups somewhere unconnected to your computer or server, there\u2019s no way to get your files without paying. Rates vary; SecureWorks saw one victim shell out $10,000, but most paid $500 to $1,000. Although large enterprises may have enough protections in place to foil ransomware on their networks, small businesses and individuals often don\u2019t, Jarvis says. Adding to the headache: The CryptoWall group requires payment in Bitcoin, which most people and businesses don\u2019t use. More traditional ransomware varieties are also on the rise. Kovter, one of the screen-locking types, reached a high of 43,713 infections on a single day in June, according to security company Damballa. For the third quarter so far, the peak count for a single day has already surpassed that, at 59,589. At TDHServices, no one in the office opens anything unless they recognize it, and the cloud file backup has its own backup. Just to be safe, Ramos also copies everything to a separate external hard drive on Fridays, before he leaves. \u201cWe saw a police report that said don\u2019t pay \u2019em,\u201d Ramos says. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018That\u2019s easy for you to say, it\u2019s not your business that\u2019s on the line.\u2019\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/DuneLawrence', 'name': u'Dune Lawrence', 'twitterhandle': u'DuneLawrence'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-29/ransomware-tells-small-business-owners-your-money-or-your-files', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 8, 29, 14, 42, 59, 52000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"'Your Money or Your Files' as Threat of Online Stickups Grows"}, {'articleText': u' Paul Ford writes eloquently in this week\u2019s Bloomberg Businessweek on the rise of Bitcoin, the \u201cmedia-friendly, anarchist crypto-currency\u201d whose value jumped as the European financial crisis landed on the doorstep of Cyprus\u2019s banking system. For the unfamiliar, Bitcoin is a form of virtual cash that\u2019s made secure by complex computations (that\u2019s the crypto part) and isn\u2019t backed by any government (the anarchistic aspect). To Ford, Bitcoin is an \u201cexcellent indicator of anxiety,\u201d often most popular with those who\u2019ve lost trust in the world\u2019s monetary institutions. But the virtual currency may have another thing going for it: practicality. Yes, Bitcoin can be difficult to wrap your head around, and it\u2019s not the best solution for buying a quart of milk. But for fast, no-fee money transfers, it can\u2019t be beat. That\u2019s the point recently made by Expensify, a four-year-old company that creates expense reports for more than 200,000 small- and medium-sized businesses and that Wednesday began offering Bitcoin to lower costs of international transactions. Expensify hopes Bitcoin will help businesses deal with a common problem: banking regulations that make direct payments impractical for companies reimbursing\xa0workers in foreign countries. Tony Vakula, Expensify\u2019s vice president of core engineering, says Expensify customers have typically used PayPal for international transactions, but the processing fees commonly stirred complaints. Enter Bitcoin, which can be transferred instantaneously, at no charge, among accounts all over the world. It\u2019s far too soon to say whether Bitcoin will prove popular with Expensify\u2019s customers\u2014or even how many of Expensify\u2019s customers will know what Bitcoin is. At the moment, Bitcoin might not be accepted widely enough to support a population of workers who want to be paid in virtual currency\u2014even if it saves them a fee. Still, it\u2019s noteworthy that the currency is finding relevance beyond Internet subcultures as a way to better serve Main Street. \u201cWe\u2019re basically trying to help solve a business problem with it,\u201d says Vakula.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/pat_clark', 'name': u'Patrick Clark', 'twitterhandle': u'pat_clark'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-29/expensify-brings-bitcoin-to-main-street', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 3, 29, 13, 1, 30, 95000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Expensify Brings Bitcoin to Main Street'}, {'articleText': u'  As the global business and political elite pour into Davos this week, more and more are arriving with pockets already full of business cards from a similar, but newer, event in Munich. DLD, a 10-year-old forum for entrepreneurs and technology companies, this year focused on data privacy and the future of Bitcoin, with headliners including Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, Huffington Post creator Arianna Huffington, and Tumblr Inc. founder David Karp. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for three hours and have already met with interesting people where there are immediate opportunities,\u201d said Peter Vesterbacka, chief marketing officer of Rovio Entertainment Oy, maker of the Angry Birds games. DLD -- the name stands for Digital-Life-Design -- has attracted about 1,000 attendees for the past several years. Despite rising demand, the organizers say they don\u2019t want to move to a larger venue because they want to retain an intimate atmosphere. The conference \u201cis about bringing together the brightest, most innovative and even the most disruptive in a friendly, open atmosphere,\u201d said DLD co-founder Steffi Czerny. The current location, the HVB Forum in the heart of Munich, has just two stages for sessions, plus a smallish dining room with catered food up for grabs throughout the day where delegates are almost forced to share tables and interact. \u201cI haven\u2019t listened to many sessions because I\u2019ve just been hanging out in here, bumping into people,\u201d six-time DLD veteran Albert Wengner, a partner at private-equity firm Union Square Ventures in New York, said over a cup of morning coffee. Timotheus Hoettges, chief executive officer of Deutsche Telekom AG, said DLD is about \u201canchoring a concrete image of what we do and what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d Ramin Assadollahi, founder of Munich-based ExB Communications Systems GmbH, a 40-worker shop that develops software for Android phones, said he comes to DLD to track down funding and seek advice from fellow startups. While DLD has in the past pulled in marquee names such as Facebook Inc. co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, Google Inc. Chairman Eric Schmidt and Yahoo! Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, it serves as a kind of anti-Davos, a place where the young and exuberant can get pumped up before heading to dinner with the in-laws. While Davos tends toward Champagne and caviar, at DLD it\u2019s Coca-Cola, sandwiches and Red Bull to keep the energy high. On Monday evening, the DLD crowd headed to a conference center near the Oktoberfest fairgrounds for a party where two Playboy bunnies posed for photos (the conference is organized by Hubert Burda Media Holding GmbH, a publishing house that owns the rights to the German edition of Playboy) and passed out magazines. Smoke machines and laser lights punctuated the rhythms of a live band and DJs while revelers ground away on the dance floor. The party \u201cis a great way to relax and just have some fun,\u201d Nicolas Dittberner, a manager at Elance, an online marketplace for freelancers based in Silicon Valley, shouted over the pounding music. That\u2019s not to say that DLD is about to overtake Davos, or that it even wants to. Yesterday a caravan of about 40 Audis shuttled many of the more prominent attendees three hours through the Austrian and Swiss Alps to the World Economic Forum, which was founded in 1971. And the final event of DLD is scheduled for 10 p.m. today in Davos. At what the organizers call the \u201cNightcap,\u201d the digerati from the Munich event rub elbows with the more buttoned-down denizens of Davos. \u201cIt makes a very convenient package to do to the whole digital-lifestyle-design bit first -- sort of the fun part as part of a casual conference -- but then go on because there are a lot of meaningful meetings in Davos,\u201d said Wikipedia co-founder Wales. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice combo.\u201d Huffington, who hosted a session on \u201cmindfulness\u201d with author Paulo Coehlo at this year\u2019s DLD, said for her it would be unthinkable to attend just one of the two events. \u201cThere\u2019s just such an amazing spirit each time I\u2019m here,\u201d Huffington said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s either-or.

He\'s also a geek, and couldn\'t help but get excited late last year when he heard about bitcoin, a new virtual currency. In February, on one of the handful of online exchanges that have appeared over the past year, he bought about $20,000 worth at less than a dollar per bitcoin. "I felt that maybe I would get a 20 or 50 percent return," says Caldwell, 33. By early June, when he sold the last of his stake, a bitcoin was worth around $30. Caldwell says his total return was well over 1,000 percent. "That magnitude was totally unexpected," he says.\n       \n      For those who got in early, it\'s a gold rush. In the last few months this online cash has exploded in usage, notoriety, and value. Like dollars or yen, a bitcoin\'s worth fluctuates with demand, but in its short history it\'s gone mostly up. About $130 million worth of bitcoins are now in existence, and the value of that stash has grown more than 6,000 percent this year. Bitcoin partisans are breathless: "This is the biggest invention since the Internet," says Bruce Wagner, an entrepreneur who hosts a monthly bitcoin meet-up group in Manhattan.\n       \n      The project was started in 2009 by an enigmatic programmer known as Satoshi Nakamoto. He always communicated electronically, never answered personal questions, and disappeared from online forums in December. The conspiracy-minded speculate that Nakamoto was actually a group of people, or a government cryptographer, or a pseudonym for Gavin Andresen, the Amherst (Mass.) programmer who took over the project after Nakamoto vanished. "I spoke to one guy who thought aliens might have come to earth to bring us this technology, it\'s so perfect," says Wagner.\n       \n      Digital transactions normally require a trusted intermediary such as PayPal to credit and debit accounts properly and prevent cheating. With bitcoins, "there is no middleman, says Andresen or," more accurately, there\'s a distributed middleman. Individual transactions are encrypted, logged by a decentralized network running on thousands of home computers, and recorded in a public ledger. The system works similarly to peer-to-peer music-sharing networks in that files are shared among swarms of users, rather than downloaded from a central server.\n       \n      Suppose you\'re in the market for alpaca socks, one of the few consumer items you can buy with bitcoins. Step one: Get some BTC\u2014that\'s the symbol\u2014at a currency exchange site such as Mt.Gox. Then download a desktop app from bitcoin.org, which will store your lucre (some use an online service such as Instawallet.org instead) and connect you to the decentralized bitcoin network. Next, find the alpaca farms bitcoin address, a string of characters also known as a public key. Click the send coins button.\n       \n      The purchase is unconfirmed until a miner certifies it. Miners are power users who crunch numbers on behalf of the network, and some have racks of computers dedicated to the task. They\'re called miners because, just as gold miners increase the supply of gold, they create new bitcoins, at an algorithmically controlled rate. The greater their computing power, the more they generate for themselves. Once a miner\'s computer has processed a transaction, the alpaca farm gets bitcoins and you get socks. It\'s complex but fast: The bitcoin network has handled as many as 87 quadrillion calculations per second, 35 times more than the top supercomputer.\n       \n      Bitcoins have all the advantages of cash\u2014free to use, very hard to trace\u2014as well as its disadvantages. That digital wallet is a file on a hard drive or online, and if it\'s lost or stolen there\'s no recourse. The currency is backed only by the faith and credit of its participants and outside the scope of any banker, politician, or the Federal Reserve. To a certain breed of libertarian nerd who grew up on cyberpunk, it\'s the Digital Rapture.\n       \n      Bitcoin also resonates with those who have something to hide. "Any anarchist cyberscheme like bitcoin will rapidly attract the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse: Mafia, drug dealers, terrorists, and child pornography," says author and futurist Bruce Sterling. The hacker group LulzSec, which has claimed credit for breaking into websites at Sony (SNE) and the U.S. Senate, says a donor recently sent in $7,000 worth of bitcoins. On June 5, Senators Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) urged federal law enforcement to shut down Silk Road, an online catalog for drugs, and spotlighted bitcoin\'s role as the only method of payment for these illegal purchases. Among the legit merchandise you can buy with bitcoin: organic gardening services, a bitcoin merit badge from NerdMeritBadge.com, and a smattering of tech products.\n       \n      Merit badges and gardening are not the stuff revolutions are made of, but bitcoin\'s ascent has created a virtuous cycle: As early adopters see the value of their stakes rise, they have an incentive to entice new users and merchants. The number of people on the bitcoin network at any given moment has climbed from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands since the start of the year, says Andresen. There are dedicated bitcoin currency exchanges, escrow accounts, and smartphone apps. In the planning stages are options exchanges, cash registers, and high-frequency trading programs.\n       \n      In late March, Mark Suppes, a Web developer (who freelances for Bloomberg LP, parent of this magazine), bought a used ATM on EBay (EBAY) for about $400. In a Brooklyn warehouse, he\'s reprogramming it to accept bitcoin transfers from a smartphone and dispense U.S. dollars. Suppes is motivated by self-interest\u2014"I own enough bitcoins that I\'ll be set if this works out," he says\u2014and a desire to stick it to what he considers economic parasites. "If there\'s one industry that takes the most cream off the top and provides the least value, its finance," he says.\n       \n      Bankers needn\'t worry at this point. The most common reason to hold bitcoins is as a speculative investment. "Any given day, it can move 20, 30, 40, even 50 percent," says Adam Cohen, a developer at startup Seatgeek who wrote a critical post about bitcoin on the Q&A site Quora. "That\'s scary. I wouldn\'t want to have a lot of my wealth tied up in it right now." Sterling calls bitcoins "a cousin project to WikiLeaks." For a glimpse of its future, he says, "find the half-dozen zealots who were core activists of WikiLeaks and ask them how their plan for massive planetary liberation has been going."\n       \n      The skeptics are why Andresen evangelizes. After his last haircut, he persuaded his barber to accept payment in bitcoin. "I had to promise I would buy it back from him if it dropped in value," he says. "I insured his downside risk."\n       \nThe bottom line: Bitcoins, a two-year-old virtual currency, have exploded in value since December as tech-minded speculators snap them up.\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': u'Barrett Sheridan', 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-06-16/bitcoins-currency-of-the-geeks', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2011, 6, 16, 21, 0, 0, 24000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoins: Currency of the Geeks'}, {'articleText': u' One of the oddest bits of news to emerge from the economic collapse of Cyprus is a corresponding rise in the value of Bitcoin, the Internet\u2019s favorite, media-friendly, anarchist crypto-currency. In Spain, Google searches for \u201cBitcoin\u201d and downloads of Bitcoin apps soared. The value of a Bitcoin went up to $78. Someone put out a press release promising a Bitcoin ATM in Cyprus. Far away, in Canada, a man said he\u2019d sell his house for BTC5,362. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by a pseudonymous hacker who calls him or herself Satoshi Nakamoto (and who might be several people). It\u2019s a form of virtual cash used to buy goods and services online. Even by Web standards, it\u2019s a strange and supergeeky phenomenon. This is what happens when software and networks meet the concept of currency, when you take peer-to-peer networks and advanced cryptography and ask, \u201cHow can I make a new economy?\u201d        March 21 (Bloomberg) -- Sara Eisen takes a look at Bitcoin, what it is and how it\'s used. She speaks on Bloomberg Television\'s "Market Makers." (Source: Bloomberg)  There are 10,952,975 Bitcoins in circulation. (With a digital currency you can be specific.) Bitcoin isn\u2019t about to replace hard currency\u2014with a market cap of $864\xa0million, all of it is worth less than what Facebook paid for Instagram\u2014but it\u2019s bigger than anyone expected. And many people will tell you that the emergence of a virtual global money supply beyond the reach and control of any government is very real and that it\u2019s time we take it seriously. As long as the Internet remains turned on, Bitcoin will be there\u2014to its adherents, it\u2019s the Platonic currency. A dollar bill has a serial number and travels from buyer to seller. A Bitcoin\u2019s not so much a thing as an understanding, a balance in a decentralized general ledger, or \u201caccount log.\u201d Bitcoins are created as the side effect of a great deal of meaningless computational work. That is, the computer could be working on protein-folding, or processing images, or doing something else with its time, but instead it\u2019s being used to \u201cmine\u201d Bitcoins\u2014searching for mathematical needles in a networked haystack. Once the needle is found, a \u201cblock\u201d of Bitcoins is born. Bitcoins live in a bit of software known as your \u201cwallet.\u201d  How did they get there? Perhaps you minted them by mining, or bought them on an exchange, or received them as part of a barter transaction. Now those Bitcoins are burning a bithole in your bitpocket, and you want to buy something. How do you spend them? Clicking around your wallet app, you set up a payment and put in the Bitcoin address of the recipient\u2014something memorable and fun, like 1Ns17iag9jJgTHD1VXjvLCEnZuQ3rJDE9L. A few minutes later, after the peer-to-peer network has authorized the transaction as legitimate, the recipient\u2019s wallet, wherever it is, will show that you\u2019ve paid up.    How is this different from PayPal? In theory anyone could run his own version of PayPal on a server and use that to transfer funds between parties. But he\u2019d also need to handle world currencies, deal with security, and handle regulations. Similarly, physical banks promise protections above and beyond stuffing cash in a mattress or dropping it off in paper bags. Financial institutions commodify trust\u2014it\u2019s not their money, after all. It\u2019s yours. Yet you trust them more than you trust yourself. Bitcoin shrugs all this off. It\u2019s not pegged to anything, and there are no regulations. It\u2019s a supercomputer-size chore to counterfeit. The key thing to understand is that there\u2019s no bank, no Federal Reserve, in the middle. It\u2019s not unlike an exchange-traded fund (for example, FORX, from Pimco)\u2014a mix of non-U.S. currencies\u2014designed as a hedge against the dollar. Bitcoin is a hedge against the entire global currency system. And no exchange is needed, unless you want to convert your Bitcoin into an actual hard currency. Bitcoin is no more arbitrary than derivatives or credit default swaps. Given that regular folks, if they\u2019re nerdy and interested in Bitcoins, can use the currency for all manner of things, including illegal things, it\u2019s arguably a far less arbitrary instrument. Maybe Bitcoin\u2019s devotees are right, and it\u2019s the currency of the future. Or perhaps it\u2019s a ridiculous joke\u2014a speculative, hilarious enterprise taken to its most insane conclusion. Given that the founder is nowhere to be found, it feels like a hoax, a parody of the global economy. That the technology used to implement it has, so far, shown itself to be impeccable and completely functional, and that it\u2019s actually being exchanged, just makes it a better joke. The truth is, it doesn\u2019t much matter if it\u2019s a joke or not. It works. The Internet is a big fan of the worst-possible-thing. Many people thought Twitter was the worst possible way for people to communicate, little more than discourse abbreviated into tiny little chunks; Facebook was a horrible way to experience human relationships, commodifying them into a list of friends whom one pokes. The Arab Spring changed the story somewhat. (BuzzFeed is another example\u2014let them eat cat pictures.) One recipe for Internet success seems to be this: Start at the bottom, at the most awful, ridiculous, essential idea, and own it. Promote it breathlessly, until you\u2019re acquired or you take over the world. Bitcoin is playing out in a similar way. It asks its users to forget about central banking in the same way Steve Jobs asked iPhone users to forget about the mouse. I have an intense memory from the early 1990s, when I was just out of college. I was seated alone in a diner. Suddenly a loud man behind me pronounced, \u201cInternet time is like regular time but seven times faster.\u201d I turned around to see a well-dressed adult, a serious person. I was mystified. How could he believe something so facile and arbitrary? On and on he went, expounding on the magical number seven. Having been through one or two bubbles, I\u2019ve learned that people can believe exactly what they want to believe. That\u2019s one of the privileges of being a human with money to spend. When you compound utopian wishfulness with the anxiety of being left behind, you\u2019ll have a bubble. Then again, we may be at the forefront of the coming Bitcoin revolution. There\u2019s no way to be sure. I\u2019ll admit to having run the Bitcoin mining software a few years ago for a week until I became convinced it was a poor use of limited computer resources. I had work to do. I expected Bitcoins to remain in the background with all of the other anarchist crypto-chatter that makes up an essential substratum of modern network thinking. But Bitcoins didn\u2019t go away. And I\u2019m increasingly convinced there\u2019s one thing that Bitcoins do that\u2019s genuinely interesting. They decentralize trust. Trust is hard to earn; verifying transactions is a brutal problem, which is why PayPal locks down your account when there\u2019s too much money flowing into it. Creating trust is traditionally the work of federal governments and branding agencies. Trust is also an easy thing to squander. Just close a beloved service, \xe0\xa0la Google Reader. Or allow your banks to fail, causing an entire country to suddenly realize that the value of their deposits, the fundamental integrity of their financial selves, was arbitrary all along.  Along comes Bitcoin, a currency in which every transaction is stored by the entire network and every coin has its own story. There\u2019s nothing to trust but math. Suddenly an idea that sounded terrible\u2014a totally decentralized currency without a central authority, where semi-anonymous parties exchange meaningless tokens\u2014becomes almost comforting, a source of power and authority. That\u2019s where Bitcoin thrives: where people would prefer to throw in their lot with anonymous strangers instead of the world economy. It\u2019s gold-bug thinking reinvented for an age of fluid transparency and instantaneous transactions. And as such it\u2019s an excellent indicator of anxiety. Where you see Bitcoins in action you find a weird and heady mix of speculative angst, a fear of being left behind, and people who appear to have lost faith in institutions, who feel most left behind. These are people who\u2019ll trade in purely arbitrary tokens, willing to forgo the comfort of banking systems for the weight of mathematics and the Internet behind it.  Bitcoin isn\u2019t tied to any commodity\u2014besides trust. As a statement on the global economy, Bitcoin is hilarious. As a currency for the disenfranchised and distrustful, it\u2019s as serious as can be.

Despite his many educational and legislative accomplishments, said biology degree is not one of them, as the\xa0Washington Post\'s\xa0Fact Checker\xa0column pointed out. \xa0 Here\'s what Paul said on Feb.\xa012: Arrington:\xa0\u201cLet\u2019s talk about economics because maybe you can actually explain this to me. I have an econ degree which means I know just enough not to understand any of what our government is [inaudible]\u201d Paul:\xa0\u201cMine\u2019s in biology and English so this is going to be a great conversation.\u201d Later in their conversation, which focussed on Bitcoin, the open source currency system, Paul doubled down on his claim.\xa0 \u201cThis is just me. I have a biology degree, okay? But with Bitcoin my concern always was whether or not something has real value. So I could imagine a kind of coin that was exchangeable. This gets back to the whole idea, does money have to be exchangeable for something to be of value?\u201d As the Post detailed, Paul holds a degree in medicine from Duke University Medical School, where he graduated in 1988. Before that, Paul attended\xa0Baylor University between 1981 and 1984, but never received an undergraduate degree. In a statement to the Post, Paul\'s senior communications director Brian Darling argued that while the senator does not hold a college degree in biology, he did study the subject.\xa0 \u201cIn the jocular bantering with the host, Dr. Rand Paul mentioned \u2018degree,\u2019 but anyone who has read Dr. Paul\u2019s official biography on his Web site can see that he was accepted early into one of the most prestigious medical schools in the country\u2014Duke University School of Medicine,\u201d Darling\xa0said. \u201cDr. Paul finished the requirements for medical school in two and one half years. While in college, Dr. Paul did study biology and English. He has no college degree and has a medical degree.\u201d Of course, whether Paul actually received a degree in biology, or just holds a run-of-the-mill medical degree, is not exactly the most pressing matter when it comes to selecting the Republican presidential nominee. On the other hand, the reason it has generated so much attention can be summed up in two words: Brian Williams.\xa0 The perception that a candidate would pad a r\xe9sum\xe9, if only during an interview (Paul\'s website bio contains no references to a biology degree), has the potential to cause real damage, especially for someone like Paul, who actively embraces the culture of\xa0political trolling.\xa0 Perhaps that\'s why Darling emailed an additional statement to the Post in which he argued his case in a different way.\xa0 \u201cIt is unfair to give Senator Paul 3 Pinocchios\xa0because a\xa0M.D. Degree is the study of biomedical sciences according to the Duke University School of Medicine.\xa0In other words, a M.D. is a biology degree. Merriam-Webster defines biology as \u2018a branch of knowledge that deals with living organisms and vital processes.\u2019 Dr. Paul never said he had an undergraduate degree in biology, and it is accurate for him to say that he has a biology degree. You are making inferences from his statement that are unwarranted. It is common knowledge that the study of medicine is the study of human biology, and a MD has a doctorate degree in one area of study of the science of biology.\u201d Other news outlets have begun picking up on the story, and how could they not given the national obsession with Williams\' memory problems. Salon ran with the headline "Rand Paul caught lying about his college record," and the Associated Press folded the degree issue into a larger piece on Paul\'s political missteps titled,\xa0"FACT CHECK: Rand Paul Backtracks on Vaccines, College."\xa0 Paul has proven himself to be adept at the rough-and-tumble game of politics, but one wonders whether self-inflicted wounds, and the shifting attempts to explain them, will stand in his way from adding to his current r\xe9sum\xe9 even further.\xa0', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-16/why-rand-paul-s-biology-degree-claim-matters', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 16, 19, 38, 4, 127000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Why Rand Paul's Biology Degree Claim Matters"}, {'articleText': u' Bitcoin is back in the news, but this time it seems to be for all the right reasons. After a blockbuster 2013, the digital currency tumbled throughout 2014 on\xa0negative headlines,\xa0such as the February 2014 bankruptcy filing of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange. Since then, the currency has been bouncing back and forth between $200 and $300. That is, until now. Bitcoin has embarked on a seven-week winning streak, the longest since November 2013, according to Bloomberg data. Industry experts and insiders have a range of reasons for the recent surge. Market participants are citing two big reasons for the rally. The first is enhanced interest and acceptance from established financial companies. Much of this is due to Bitcoin\'s blockchain technology, which Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and a number of other firms have taken an interest in\xa0as they seek to apply it to overhauling the\xa0trading of securities, derivatives, and loans. According to Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who covers\xa0the sector, said in an interview that Bitcoin is finally catching on with the financial establishment. It is becoming increasingly clear to banks and financial institutions that\xa0bitcoin and blockchain technology will become an important part of the future\xa0delivery of financial services based on media coverage and investments by other large banks. As investors realize that many of the applications will be built on the bitcoin blockchain, they eventually arrive at the conclusion that if these applications succeed the price of the bitcoin currency will go up. Our 12-month price target for bitcoin is $400 based on expectations for broad adoption of bitcoin applications within the next ten years. Others in the community\xa0are speculating that the economic situation in China\xa0could be fuelling the\xa0rise as market turbulence encourages local investors\xa0to get creative when it comes to\xa0moving their money out of the country. Bitcoin offers one potential avenue around capital controls. This year has brought about an unprecedented exodus\xa0of cash from China following a surprise devaluation of the yuan in August and a two-month stock market rout. Investors pulled $194 billion from the country in September, extending this year\u2019s outflow to $669 billion.\xa0 Adding to the positive sentiment is a recent decision\xa0from a top European Union court, which\xa0ruled that exchanging virtual currencies should be exempt from value-added tax in the same way as traditional cash. Basically, this levels the playing field a bit between Bitcoin and traditional money. Ashraf Laidi, chief executive officer of Intermarket Strategy, argued in\xa0a note this morning that the momentum from the EU ruling could Bitcoin propel the crypto currency to\xa0"store of value"\xa0status: Bitcoin surged in June-July amid surging market expectations of a Greece exit and the revelation that China held less gold in its reserves than had been anticipated. Last week\u2019s court ruling should push exchanges, brokerages and banks to launch bitcoin-related instruments such as ETFS, aimed at trading, hedging and speculation. Bitcoin\u2019s medium of exchange will only grow from here. Its \'store of value\' status may not be a consideration for today, but will become so next year.

Gamblers thought it was fun, and economists marveled at how well the prediction market produced accurate forecasts. Intrade users traded contracts that paid out if a certain event happened in the future. If a $10 "Obama wins Ohio" contract was trading for $6, that meant the market gave him a 60 percent chance of taking the state.\xa0Intrade\'s users guessed right on\xa049\xa0of 50 states. But Intrade\'s biggest success was followed almost\xa0immediately\xa0by a lawsuit from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission,\xa0which forced the company to close its doors in March 2013. Two competing projects\u2014Truthcoin and Augur\u2014are now fighting to be the next Intrade by the time the 2016 election is in full swing. And if they work as promised, they\xa0will be much harder to shut down.\xa0 Jeremy Gardner, Augur\'s director of operations, compares\xa0Intrade to\xa0Napster, the music file-sharing service. Both Intrade and Napster processed transactions through a centralized server, and both were shut down. After Napster, music piracy moved to services based on BitTorrent, a type of decentralized software that exists on machines in millions of people\'s homes. It has bedeviled the entertainment industry ever since. A prediction market built the same way should be similarly immune to legal crackdowns.\xa0\xa0\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is create a platform. We don\u2019t own it, we don\u2019t operate it, we don\u2019t profit from it," says Gardner. Truthcoin and Augur were both born out of the same research paper by Truthcoin\'s founder, Paul Sztorc. An early Intrade enthusiast, Sztorc had followed the site since he was a teenager and was working at Yale\'s department of economics around the time it was shuttered. Months later, he\xa0posted a paper online showing how to use the technology underlying Bitcoin to build a more durable\xa0prediction\xa0market. Sztorc\u2019s system relied on its network of users to decide which markets to create and report on the outcome of events people were betting on.\xa0 At first, Sztorc didn\u2019t want to build the technology himself. He saw what had happened to Intrade. \u201cNo one knows where the legality of this is, and I\u2019ll just write the papers,\u201d Sztorc said of his thinking at the time.\xa0\u201cI can just be famous for it, but I don\u2019t have to be involved.\u201d\xa0 The paper created a bit of a buzz in Bitcoin circles, where a new plan for undermining centralized\xa0authority\xa0is always welcome. Augur were one of the groups that tried to execute the vision.Their efforts began building steam, drawing support from such people as Ron\xa0Bernstein, one of Intrade\u2019s founders. \u201cI\u2019ve suffered over the past three or four years trying to build a future for Intrade, and these guys have figured it out,\u201d\xa0he\xa0said.\xa0 At first, Sztorc was also on board and was helping advise Augur. But by this spring he had soured on the\xa0relationship.\xa0The conflict, according to both sides, was rooted in\xa0a technical dispute. Truthcoin and Augur are trying to solve the same problem that Bitcoin solves: creating trustworthy transactions between people who don\u2019t know one another, without relying on some central referee.\xa0Bitcoin does this by asking users to verify each transaction, which is\xa0then recorded\xa0in a single public record called\xa0the\xa0blockchain. Users who verify the transactions are rewarded with Bitcoin. In the blockchain version of a prediction market, referees are asked to verify the outcome of events. The technology looks at all the referees\' answers and determines that the most popular answer is the correct one.\xa0Those referees who provided the consensus answer are rewarded.\xa0 Sztorc thought building a network like this\xa0could be done using an altered form of the technology that underlies Bitcoin; Augur\xa0wanted to use a new technology called\xa0Ethereum. Each side thought the other\xa0approach\xa0was fundamentally flawed. What followed was a textbook fight between coders. Soon Sztorc was accusing Augur of being\xa0\u201ca way to\xa0scam money\xa0from\xa0gullible Ethereum users,\u201d\xa0and Augur\'s Gardner was saying that Truthcoin was the\xa0\u201cmost\xa0manipulatable\xa0system possible.\u201d\xa0 Each side is\xa0attracting the resources to prove that it\'s\xa0right. Augur recently raised nearly $5 million in a crowdfunding campaign.\xa0Sztorc\u2019s project is being backed by prominent Bitcoin\xa0investor\xa0Roger Ver, mostly\xa0because\xa0he thinks it\'s the option more likely to actually work. Both Augur and Ethereum are untested technologies, said Ver, and \u201ceither one could have serious bugs that have serious problems." The legal prospects for Truthcoin and Augur are also unclear.\xa0Augur has been talking to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\xa0in hopes of getting a no-action letter, which would explicitly say that the company doesn\u2019t need to register as a commodities market. The CFTC has given two such letters\xa0for political prediction markets run by academic institutions for\xa0research\xa0purposes. In 2012, it rejected a plan by\xa0the North American Derivatives Exchange to trade contracts based on political events. A CFTC spokesman declined to comment.\xa0 At the same time, Sztorc and Gardner both say they\xa0don\u2019t\xa0feel like they really need the CFTC\u2019s endorsement. The commission regulates commodities markets; they\u2019re making software. \u201cYou can\u2019t sue a gun manufacturer\xa0because\xa0someone\xa0uses\xa0their gun to kill someone,\u201d\xa0said\xa0Gardner.\xa0 Nate Cardozo, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says this reasoning may be shaky. \u201cIf a judge looks at your system and it looks like a gambling site or unregulated\xa0derivatives, a judge is probably\xa0going to treat it as what it looks like, all your cute arguments aside,\u201d\xa0he said. The fact that Augur and Truthcoin are\xa0explicitly\xa0designed to facilitate betting on\xa0politics is not likely to help their cause.\xa0 A crackdown would be a problem for the people who built the trading platforms, but maybe not the platforms themselves. The only real way to crack down on software designed like this is to stop it before it\'s\xa0built. If either Augur or Truthcoin becomes the BitTorrent of prediction markets, suing the people who made them won\'t do a whole lot.\xa0 Correction: Corrects previous version of this story which misstated the name of\xa0Ron Bernstein.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-18/these-two-projects-are-racing-to-bring-election-gambling-back-for-2016', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 9, 18, 13, 30, 3, 591000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'These Two Projects\xa0Are Racing to Bring Election Gambling Back for\xa02016'}, {'articleText': u' In 2006, the tiny Caribbean state of St. Kitts and Nevis was in deep trouble. Its sugar plantations had closed a year earlier, gang violence had given it the dubious distinction of having one of the world\u2019s highest murder rates, and only two governments on Earth were more indebted. A three-hour flight south of Miami, the country of 48,000 people was more or less unknown. Certainly, the two specks of volcanic rock in the middle of the West Indies weren\u2019t of much interest to the world\u2019s rich. St. Kitts and Nevis had run a citizenship-by-investment program\u2014had sold passports\u2014since 1984, but it didn\u2019t get much attention and was never a moneymaker. Then a Swiss lawyer named Christian Kalin showed up. Thanks to Kalin, St. Kitts has become the world\u2019s most popular place to buy a passport, offering citizenship for $250,000 with no requirement that applicants ever set foot on the island\u2019s sun-kissed shores. Buyers get visa-free travel to 132 countries, limited disclosure of financial information, and no taxes on income or capital gains. The program became so successful that St. Kitts emerged from the global financial crisis far ahead of its neighbors in the Caribbean. \u201cIt\u2019s been a complete transformation,\u201d says Judith Gold, head of an International Monetary Fund mission to the country. Just as Kalin put St. Kitts on the map, Bloomberg Markets will report in its April 2015 issue, the reverse is also true. It made his reputation. Before St. Kitts, Kalin\u2019s firm, Henley & Partners, was an obscure wealth management and immigration consultancy, and Kalin was working out of a small branch office in Zurich. Tall, with a runner\u2019s build, Kalin was known as a researcher, he says, not the hard-nosed dealmaker he\u2019s become. His claim to fame was having edited a 766-page guide to doing business in Switzerland, a tome found in every one of the country\u2019s embassies. Soon, prime ministers from around the world were seeking Kalin\u2019s advice, in the hope he could reproduce the magic of St. Kitts, where he effectively created a resource out of thin air for a nation that had few. Many countries allow wealthy foreigners to buy residency cards through what are called immigrant investor programs, but before the financial crisis, St. Kitts and another Caribbean island called Dominica were the only ones selling citizenship outright. Since then, another five countries have gotten into the game. More are coming. Kalin advised the governments of Cyprus and Grenada, which established citizenship-by-investment plans in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Also in 2013, he designed a program very much like St. Kitts\u2019s for Antigua and Barbuda. In 2014, Kalin crafted a plan for Malta, the smallest member of the European Union. \u201cPretty much every government that has even contemplated this has talked to us,\u201d he says. In St. Lucia, a task force is considering proposals from Henley and other firms. Albania, Croatia, Jamaica, Montenegro, and Slovenia are looking at programs, too. \u201cThe bottom line\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a phrase Kalin uses often\u2014\u201cis that more states are open to making citizenship rights available through investment,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it makes a lot of sense. Why not give citizenship to people who contribute a lot to the country?\u201d Since revamping the St. Kitts program in November 2006, Kalin has built Henley into the biggest firm in an industry turning citizenship into a commodity. Investors spent an estimated $2 billion buying new passports last year alone, and Kalin predicts demand will grow along with the ranks of the wealthy in emerging countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of mobility and also security,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re from a country that\u2019s politically unstable, where you\u2019re not sure what the future holds, you want to have an alternative.\u201d Henley is privately held and Kalin won\u2019t discuss its revenue, but he says by the end of 2014, the firm had helped dozens of governments raise $4 billion in direct investment through citizenship or residency programs. It has also advised thousands of multimillionaires on where and how to buy a passport of convenience, collecting fees and commissions from all sides. Last year, at 42, Kalin became Henley\u2019s chairman. The business Kalin pioneered has its share of critics, who say it gives the wealthy more room to avoid taxes and provides safe harbor to people who made their money illegally. \u201cWe\u2019ve created over the past 50 years an entire shadow financial system that helps people hide money,\u201d says Raymond Baker, president of the Washington-based advocacy group Global Financial Integrity. \u201cThis is a new wrinkle in that.\u201d In June, Bloomberg News reported that Paul Bilzerian, a former Wall Street raider who served two prison terms for fraud, was claiming to be licensed to process citizenship applications for St. Kitts, where he now lives. Bilzerian helped an entrepreneur named Roger Ver\u2014a provocateur widely known as Bitcoin Jesus\u2014to purchase citizenship on the island. The two men then launched a website called Passports for Bitcoin to help people in places such as China use virtual currency to skirt local laws limiting money transfers. Learning of this, the St. Kitts citizenship unit made a hasty announcement that it wouldn\u2019t be accepting bitcoins as payment. Bilzerian declined to comment for this story. \u201cLike everywhere, in any industry, you have a spectrum of highly professional people all the way down to crooks and idiots,\u201d Kalin says. Still, the passport business isn\u2019t quite like any other. It presses moral buttons that most industries don\u2019t. Is it right to turn citizenship into something that can be bought and sold? That\u2019s still an open question for most people, and Kalin admits as much. \u201cIt\u2019s sensitive,\u201d he says. Beyond those sensitivities, there\u2019s also concern that criminals, or even terrorists, are buying second passports. The U.S. Treasury Department issued a warning in May 2014 that St. Kitts had granted passports to Iranian nationals seeking to avoid trade sanctions on the country for its nuclear program. In November, Canada announced it would no longer allow St. Kitts citizens to enter without a visa, due to concerns about \u201cidentity management practices within its Citizenship by Investment program.\u201d St. Kitts responded the next month with a passport recall. Those issued from January 2012 to July 2014 would have to be returned and replaced with ones indicating the holder\u2019s place of birth and any other names by which he or she had been known\u2014information that wasn\u2019t on the originals. Montreal-based Arton Capital, Henley\u2019s biggest competitor, estimates as many as 16,000 passports may be returned. Nicholas Shaxson, author of Treasure Islands, a 2010 book about tax havens, says the industry feeds into a culture of corruption in poor countries that make a business of ignoring their own laws. \u201cThese smaller jurisdictions haven\u2019t got anything to sell besides \u2018we\u2019ll let you do anything you want,\u2019\u201d he says. Developed countries run into trouble, too. Miguel Macedo, Portugal\u2019s interior minister, stepped down in November, and the head of the country\u2019s immigration services was arrested amid an investigation into influence peddling and embezzlement in its new residency-by- investment program. Macedo has denied any wrongdoing. \u201cAll of the programs have a certain tendency for corruption, unfortunately,\u201d Kalin says. \u201cBut you have to understand that we, and I, have not paid a single cent to any government official, ever.\u201d *** Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, starts his sales pitch with a geography lesson for all would-be citizens who might have trouble finding the country on a map. (It\u2019s about 60 miles [100 kilometers] east of St. Kitts.) Then, bending over the podium, he reads out a list of the country\u2019s selling points, including its \u201c365 beaches, its pristine waters, beautiful climate.\u201d The prime minister sounds less like a statesman than a tour guide, or perhaps the property developer he once was. He\u2019s selling Antiguan citizenship, which can be had for a $200,000 donation or a $400,000 investment in real estate, plus about $60,000 in fees, a deal similar to the one St. Kitts offers. In the weeks before, Browne had delivered the same pitch at roadshows in Toronto and London. This time, in late October, he\u2019s in Singapore at the five-star Fullerton Hotel, where Henley & Partners is hosting its eighth annual Global Residence and Citizenship Conference. The prime minister of Malta, the premier of Nevis, the commerce minister of Cyprus, and a Portuguese ambassador are here, too. They\u2019ve all come at Kalin\u2019s invitation. Each will have about 15 minutes to make his pitch. For Joseph Muscat of Malta, it\u2019s the fourth appearance at a Henley event in 12 months. Malta\u2019s contract with Henley requires high-ranking government officials to speak at the firm\u2019s events \u201cwhenever requested.\u201d The audience is 300 or so lawyers and accountants, middlemen in the citizenship-by-investment industry who probably have little interest in tourist amenities. For their clients\u2014mostly wealthy Chinese, Russians, and Middle Easterners looking for second passports\u2014the less time spent in places like Antigua the better. Indeed, one of the first things Browne did after being elected last June was to lower Antigua\u2019s residency requirement for citizenship buyers to five days over five years from 35 days over the same period. Browne also threw out a plan to publish passport recipients\u2019 names. No other program except Malta\u2019s does that. \u201cIt was an issue of competition,\u201d he explains the day before his speech. Antigua settled on five days of residency as a compromise, he says, \u201cso there will be some familiarity with the destination. We don\u2019t want it to appear as just a vulgar sale of passports.\u201d That\u2019s what the industry is most afraid of, says Nuri Katz, CEO of Apex Capital Partners, an immigration consulting firm based in Montreal. It\u2019s the reason leaders like Browne talk about beaches few want to visit and people in the business insist on the term citizenship by investment rather than passports for sale. \u201cThere\u2019s a stigma against it, so everyone is trying to keep it under the radar,\u201d Katz says. There are things about Antigua\u2019s situation that Browne leaves out of his standard speech. The economy has shrunk by a quarter since the financial crisis. Tourism has taken a hit, and the country\u2019s biggest employer, Stanford International Bank, collapsed after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged its owners with operating a massive Ponzi scheme. \u201cWe need the money,\u201d Browne says. Yiorgos Lakkotrypis, the commerce minister of Cyprus, makes a few remarks about beaches and then cuts to the chase, taking about 30 seconds to speed through the procedure of buying citizenship in the third-smallest country in the European Union, with no residency required. \u201cThe process?\u201d he says. \u201cVery simple.\u201d Applicants fill out a three-page form, invest \u20ac2.5 million ($2.8 million) in a villa, and pay \u20ac7,000 in fees. Then, as long as they\u2019re able to produce a Certificate of Clean Criminal Record, \u201cwithin 90 days, they can get their European passport.\u201d \u201cWithin 90 days,\u201d he repeats. \u201cLately, we even achieve 70 days. It\u2019s very easy process and has very high approval rate.\u201d Kalin says the essential attraction of a second passport has to do with travel: People of means want to be able to move around without endless visa hassles. Taxes are another motivation. Citizenship in places such as St. Kitts or Antigua, where the rate on capital gains is zero, can help a tax lawyer make the case you don\u2019t owe money in other jurisdictions. Thomas Liepman, director of the Christophe Harbour resort in St. Kitts, is at the Singapore conference selling time-share condominiums that come with citizenship for a minimum investment of $400,000. Henley promotes Liepman\u2019s resort, along with several others, and collects referral fees. Condo-with-passport packages have become so popular that the island is dotted with villas that are rarely occupied. \u201cThis is a fantastic property to have a home, to have an address when the taxman comes asking why I claim that I\u2019m a resident of St. Kitts and Nevis,\u201d Liepman tells the audience. There are a few passport shoppers mingling among the crowd of brokers during intermissions. Auyong Jeen is one of them. A short man from Indonesia in his late 60s, with his shirt untucked and a stack of brochures under one arm, he says he has commercial interests all over the place, including cigarette and cup ramen factories in Cambodia. \u201cTravel difficult,\u201d he says, struggling for words in English. Indonesians can visit only 56 countries without a visa, and prized destinations like the U.S. and the EU countries aren\u2019t among them. Another potential buyer is Gul Chotrani. A heavyset Singaporean with his sleeves rolled up, he says his job is managing the family fortune. He\u2019s come to the conference as a guest of his representative at Bank of Singapore. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed,\u201d Chotrani says, \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as home loyalty anymore. You have to protect your assets. It\u2019s the simplest economic logic.\u201d *** After Henley struck the deal in St. Kitts, business came more easily. So did controversy. Kalin made enemies by driving hard bargains in country after country. In Antigua, the government backed out of its agreement with him just months after the ink dried on a November 2012 contract that would have given Henley the exclusive right to market its citizenship program. Then\u2013Attorney General Justin Simon says Henley took advantage of Antigua\u2019s desperation. \u201cI\u2019m just a very good negotiator,\u201d Kalin says. \u201cThe former prime minister and Justin Simon can say they were cornered, or they can say what they want. But the process was very fair and very transparent. They reneged.\u201d When Kalin started the St. Kitts deal, the world\u2019s oldest citizenship-by-investment program had already been around for decades, but it was slow-moving and bureaucratic. \u201cIt was a mess,\u201d Kalin says. Earlier that year, the U.S. State Department had warned the program\u2019s inadequate regulation was adding to the islands\u2019 already high risk of corruption and money laundering. Kalin\u2019s idea was to put the program directly under the oversight of Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, a physician who\u2019d been in power since 1995. It was a move that had unintended consequences. The deal gave Henley exclusive rights to market St. Kitts as a citizenship destination and a 10 percent commission on every $250,000 investment into a vehicle Kalin set up: the Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation, a fund meant to generate jobs for people who\u2019d lost work in the cane fields. The government, which had owned the sugar plantations and processing plants, shuttered the industry in 2005, saying it was no longer competitive. Henley\u2019s deal was a five-year, renewable monopoly. From the start, the contract made members of Douglas\u2019s own cabinet uncomfortable. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe that anybody should get exclusivity,\u201d says Sam Condor, the former deputy prime minister. \u201cAll these people who are now saying Henley got a sweetheart deal?\u201d Kalin says. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit. We all started from zero. Totally from zero. No one knew how successful this would be.\u201d \u2018The process? Very simple,\u2019 says the commerce minister of Cyprus. \u2018Within 90 days, they can get their European passport.\u2019 Shortly after the agreement was concluded, Henley hired a man named Wendell Lawrence, a consultant who was at the same time a paid adviser to the prime minister. Lawrence had been the top bureaucrat at the finance ministry until mid-2005 and was also related to Douglas through marriage, a typical connection on an island where everyone knows everyone. Lawrence says his consulting work for Douglas never involved the citizenship program. \u201cThere were firewalls to prevent conflict of interest,\u201d he says. Kalin says that although Lawrence was advertised on Henley\u2019s website as a partner, he didn\u2019t have an ownership stake in the firm. The tangle of relationships stretched in other directions, too. Douglas appointed the mother of his two children, a former diplomat named Kate Alex Woodley, to head a consulate in Dubai that opened in 2012 to market the citizenship program. Meanwhile, the business got an unexpected boost. In May 2009, the EU and six Caribbean countries, including St. Kitts, signed an agreement permitting mutual visa- free travel. All of a sudden, a St. Kitts passport was a lot more valuable. Then another piece fell into place. Canada started to close its investor immigration window. Since the 1990s, the country had been offering residency to wealthy people in exchange for an interest-free loan worth about $650,000. When the program was shuttered outright in early 2014, there were 75,000 unprocessed applications, an enormous opportunity for every other country trying to lure investors. The St. Kitts citizenship-by-investment unit doesn\u2019t say who buys passports or how much money has been generated. The country has no freedom of information legislation, and an integrity-in-public-life act, promised when Douglas took power, hasn\u2019t been made law. \u201cDr. Douglas handled all of the passports. He signed them all,\u201d says Dwyer Astaphan, a former minister of national security who resigned in 2008 and became an outspoken critic of Douglas. \u201cNobody in St. Kitts has the slightest clue how many passports have been issued, including his cabinet members. I was one.\u201d Douglas didn\u2019t respond to multiple interview requests and declined to answer questions in writing. The prime minister was defeated in a Feb. 16 election by Timothy Harris, a former political ally. At the time of this writing, Harris had yet to comment publicly on his plans for the citizenship program. \xa0 *** In the summer of 2013, Kalin took his product to Malta, an island of 420,000 people near Sicily. The stakes were now much higher. Maltese citizenship confers the right to live and work anywhere in the European Union and to travel visa-free to the U.S. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the entire story,\u201d says Demetrios Papademetriou, an expert on investor immigration programs and founder of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. In January of last year, Malta started selling citizenship for \u20ac650,000. (Over the next few months, it added additional investment requirements.) During its first year, the program raised more than \u20ac500 million\u2014an amount equal to 16 percent of the government\u2019s 2014 budget. Henley earns a 4 percent commission on all the funds paid to Malta. The firm also gets \u20ac70,000 from each of its clients, and additional fees if their spouses or children apply. Kalin says he designed the program with higher barriers to entry than elsewhere. Applicants are run against law-enforcement databases and checked by a due diligence firm. Even then, a candidate who comes up clean might be rejected simply because something doesn\u2019t feel right, Kalin says, offering the hypothetical example of a Pakistani national with a pharmaceutical business in the Central African Republic. Despite these apparent safeguards, then\u2013EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding blasted the program in January 2014. \u201cCitizenship must not be up for sale,\u201d she said. The truth is, though, the EU can do little about the program other than make speeches. There\u2019s no legal basis for stopping a member country from exercising its sovereignty. \u201cThe reason the EU commission really slammed down on this,\u201d says Papademetriou, \u201cwas because it amounted to selling an EU passport and they didn\u2019t trust Malta to do the due diligence.\u201d Jason Azzopardi, a Maltese lawmaker from the opposition Nationalist Party, calls the program the \u201cprostitution of our citizenship.\u201d He says the prime minister deceived voters by waiting until after being elected in June 2013 to mention the idea of selling passports. Kalin brushes it all aside. \u201cThis is the key point,\u201d he says. \u201cThe opposition realizes that this program is going to keep them out of power for a long time. It\u2019s going to bring in a lot of money, and whoever is in office is going to benefit.\u201d Malta\u2019s Individual Investor Programme was eventually modified to include a residency requirement that is vague even according to the program\u2019s CEO, Jonathan Cardona. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say physical residency,\u201d Cardona says. \u201cWe expect an individual to be in Malta for a number of days; we don\u2019t go into the specific number. If you\u2019re asking me, are these people going to move here entirely, I would say, \u2018Listen, let\u2019s not fool ourselves.\u2019\u201d \u201cForget residency,\u201d says Apex Capital\u2019s Katz. \u201cThere\u2019s not even an educational requirement. You don\u2019t have to have graduated high school. The only criteria are you have dough and you\u2019re not a criminal.\u201d Prime Minister Muscat presents things differently. He describes Malta\u2019s citizenship program as an exclusive membership club open only to the best and brightest of the wealthy. \u201cIf you are after the cheapest route to citizenship,\u201d he tells the audience at Henley\u2019s Singapore conference, \u201cMalta is not for you. If you\u2019re after a program that allows in all and sundry, then, sorry again, we\u2019re not for you. But if you want to join the highest-end talent program in the world, we welcome you.\u201d As the prime minister speaks, a PowerPoint glitch plays an unfortunate trick on him. He\u2019d come onstage after a slide show introducing Henley\u2019s salespeople, the last of whom was blond-haired Christopher Willis, the firm\u2019s rep in St. Kitts. Willis\u2019s giant head shot, next to a map of the Caribbean, is frozen on-screen. It looms over the prime minister\u2019s shoulder the entire time he\u2019s pitching Malta and its better class of citizenship program. However Muscat tries to sell it, nobody watching will be able to forget where it all started. Additional reporting by Pavel Alpeyev, Jim Powell, Peter Langan, and Terje Langeland.

By making its case against Silk Road and its alleged proprietor,\xa0prosecutors will be\xa0offering\xa0a rare glimpse\xa0into how the justice system\xa0deals with\xa0the darkest corners of the Internet.\xa0 Silk Road was designed to be anonymous. Users had to use Tor, a tool\xa0that\xa0obscures the identity of Web users. All\xa0transactions\xa0were carried out in Bitcoin, a cybercurrency favored by those trying to cover\xa0their\xa0tracks. During its heyday, from early 2011 until 2013, sellers\xa0used the site to sell\xa0hundreds of kilograms of narcotics\xa0and other\xa0illicit goods worth hundreds of millions of dollars,\xa0according to federal prosecutors. At the\xa0center\xa0of the operation and taking a cut from every transaction, prosecutors argue, was Ross Ulbricht, the man charged with criminal conspiracy,\xa0drug trafficking, computer\xa0hacking,\xa0and money laundering.\xa0 The party ended in October 2013 after federal agents apprehended the 29-year-old Ulbricht and identified him as the "Dread Pirate Roberts," the nom de Internet used by the person operating Silk Road. At the time of his arrest, Ulbricht was logged into Silk Road from\xa0his laptop and sitting in\xa0the science fiction section of a library in San Francisco.\xa0Prosecutors argue that\xa0Ulbricht\'s involvement went beyond\xa0drug running and\xa0computer hacking to arranging a number of assassinations of people who\xa0threatened his business. One of those murders-for-hire was staged by a\xa0federal agent, and prosecutors\xa0don\u2019t think the other killings\xa0ever took place. While Ulbricht has been indicted for paying $80,000 for a hit in Maryland, he isn\u2019t facing any charges for violent crimes.\xa0 Ulbricht\'s imprisonment for the last 15 months has hardly ended illicit\xa0online commerce. People have found their drugs through such marketplaces as Evolution, Agora, and Silk Road 2.0. Sites like these are also subject to raids by law enforcement\u2014hundreds of  domains were shut down in a single operation in November\u2014with new ones constantly taking their place. This weekend, a new market called Silk Road Reloaded set up shop, using an alternative to Tor as a way to\xa0guarantee\xa0users\u2019 anonymity.\xa0The\xa0industry will be\xa0watching\xa0the\xa0Silk Road case closely. Ulbricht has drawn more support than your average alleged online drug\xa0dealer. His lawyer, Joshua Dratel,\xa0has represented a number of high-profile terrorism suspects, and Roger Ver, a libertarian entrepreneur, has donated $165,000 to his defense. Libertarian activists and the Electronic Frontier Foundation\xa0have expressed concern\xa0about the way the\xa0government has handled the case. Lyn Ulbricht, Ross\u2019s mother,\xa0wants to turn the trial of her son into a referendum on government surveillance.\xa0\u201cThe\xa0defendant and the allegations in this case are secondary,\u201d she told Reason.tv in November. "I know they\u2019re controversial, much of it cannot be defended in terms of, you know, people\u2019s morality or whatever. What\u2019s really important here, and dangerous here, is how the\xa0government\xa0is operating.\u201d\xa0\xa0 There\u2019s a widespread\xa0feeling\xa0that the Federal Bureau of\xa0Investigation\xa0is obscuring how it conducted its investigation. In a court filing, the agency\xa0said it noticed\xa0a\xa0weakness\xa0in the Silk Road\u2019s website that was\xa0inadvertently\xa0leaking the IP address of its server. Security analyst\xa0Nik Cubrilovic attempted to\xa0replicate\xa0the problem and couldn\u2019t do so. Cubrilovic thinks the FBI hacked the site to get that information and is\xa0giving an intentionally vague\xa0explanation to avoid admitting it.\xa0\u201cThe FBI have good reason to not mention any bugs or forcing the server to do anything, and to pretend that they simply picked up the IP addresses from the wire, since such actions\xa0would\xa0raise concerns about how lawful\xa0their\xa0actions\xa0in uncovering the IP addresses were,\u201d\xa0he wrote in a blog post.\xa0 Dratel already tried to argue that the FBI\u2019s methods against his client violate the constitutional\xa0ban on illegal search and seizure, but Judge Katherine Forrest didn\u2019t agree, so Ulbricht\u2019s defense won\'t be able to raise such questions during trial. Still, information about the FBI\u2019s investigation could come out in the courtroom and change the equation. If Ulbricht\xa0is\xa0found\xa0guilty,\xa0the\xa0use of this evidence could\xa0be the\xa0subject of an\xa0appeal, says Electronic Frontier Foundation\'s Hanni Fakhoury. Some observers worry that allowing the evidence to stand\xa0could have wide implications for what limits law enforcement will face when it comes to hacking.\xa0 Dratel also\xa0fought to bar prosecutors from bringing up certain evidence in court. While Judge Forrest decided against the defense\xa0in most instances, she did block prosecutors from\xa0citing the availability on Silk Road of such bomb-making books as Homemade C-4: A Recipe for Survival. Prosecutors will be allowed\xa0to say they found a\xa0copy of The Construction & Operation of Clandestine Drug Laboratories\xa0on Ulbricht\u2019s computer. Others have focused on the idea that Ulbricht could be found guilty of drug trafficking by\xa0running\xa0a website that other people were using to sell and buy drugs. Generally, websites haven\u2019t been held accountable for the\xa0actions of their users. Fakhoury says that Silk Road isn\u2019t a great test case for this issue, given that it was explicitly encouraging drug sales. But he notes that other cases, such as\xa0one in which FedEx has been indicted for allegedly helping foster illicit pharmaceutical sales, are closer to the blurred lines and could set a dangerous precedent.\xa0\u201cWhat will be interesting is to see how the government treats more borderline sites,\u201d Fakhoury\xa0says. The purest libertarian argument, put forward by Ver, is that online drug bazaars in and of themselves aren\u2019t such a bad idea.\xa0"Many people are making the argument that the platform should not be held responsible for what the users do,\u201d\xa0he said in an e-mail. "I agree with this reasoning, but for me the stronger motivating factor is that I think each individual owns their own body and has the absolute right to put whatever they want into it.\u201d\xa0', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-13/the-nondrug-users-guide-to-the-silk-road-trial', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 13, 11, 51, 4, 913000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"The Non-Drug User's Guide to the Silk Road Trial"}, {'articleText': u'  From an Internet caf\xe9 in San Francisco, a 29-year-old free-market evangelist who called himself \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d allegedly used untraceable web services, an international network of servers and anonymous digital currency to run a global online exchange of cocaine and heroin. For two years, cybercrime experts from the FBI pored over the secretive online drug bazaar, known as Silk Road -- an operation that prosecutors say had become, by the time they shut it down this week, the venue for as much as $1 billion worth of illegal transactions. Seeking the mastermind behind it, investigators began picking up clues: an anonymous posting to a website devoted to hallucinogenic mushrooms, recurring references to libertarian economics and early hints left on public sites including Google and LinkedIn. A big break came in July, when a routine inspection of inbound mail from Canada turned up a parcel containing several counterfeit IDs -- each with a different name and all featuring the photograph of the same man. According to a 33-page criminal complaint unsealed Oct. 2 in Manhattan federal court, the man in the ID photos was Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road\u2019s alleged mastermind. FBI agents arrested Ulbricht on Tuesday at the Glen Park library in San Francisco, where he had gone to log onto a computer, according to a person briefed on the matter. Ulbricht made an initial appearance Oct. 2 in federal court in San Francisco, where he listened to charges against him of narcotics trafficking, money laundering and computer-hacking conspiracy. He faces separate charges of attempted murder in Maryland, from an indictment unsealed there Oct 2. The criminal complaint against Ulbricht depicts the dark side of Internet commerce. In it, special agent Christopher Tarbell of the FBI\u2019s New York office described Silk Road as \u201cthe most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today\u201d -- a virtual bazaar where buyers could find everything from heroin and hacking software to contact information for hit men in more than 10 different countries. The genius of Silk Road\u2019s design and the reason it eluded the FBI\u2019s grasp for so long, according to the complaint, was its impenetrability. The site was accessible only on a so-called Tor network, which is designed to conceal the true Internet addresses of computers using it. Its exclusive reliance on Bitcoin, an anonymous digital currency, added another layer of protection for its buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, the site\u2019s master, operating as Dread Pirate Roberts, or DPR, became something of a phenomenon. As the site\u2019s founder and curator, DPR resolved disputes between parties and dictated the terms on which buyers and sellers could transact. Word of the site spread thanks in part to a profile on Gawker website in June 2011. That same month, two U.S. Senators, Chuck Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder and Drug Enforcement Agency chief Michele Leonhart, urging them to investigate Silk Road and shut down Bitcoin. Starting in November 2011, Tarbell\u2019s undercover team made more than 100 purchases of drugs from Silk Road vendors, accepting shipments of ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, LSD and other drugs posted from 10 different countries, including the U.S., according to the complaint. An agent on Tarbell\u2019s team also combed through Internet postings and discovered that the earliest mention of Silk Road had appeared on shroomery.org, an informational website for consumers of \u201cmagic mushrooms,\u201d in January 2011. The posting, from someone with the username altoid, alerted the site\u2019s visitors to Silk Road and asked if anyone had tried it. Two days later, someone using the same username posted a similar message on \u201cbitcointalk.org,\u201d a discussion forum for the virtual currency. \u201cThe two postings created by \u2018altoid\u2019 on Shroomery and Bitcoin Talk appear to be attempts to generate interest in the site,\u201d Tarbell wrote. \u201cThe fact that \u2018altoid\u2019 posted similar messages about the site on two very different discussion forums, two days apart, indicates that \u2018altoid\u2019 was\u2026seeking to publicize the site among the forum users -- which, based on my training and experience, is a common online marketing tactic for new websites.\u201d In October 2011, altoid surfaced again on the Bitcoin forum, seeking an \u201cIT pro\u201d to help build a Bitcoin startup company and directing potential job candidates to the Gmail account of someone named Ross Ulbricht. From a Google profile associated with the account, the FBI learned that Ulbricht had an interest in the Austrian school of economics and the Ludwig von Mises Institute -- an Auburn, Alabama-based group that functions as a center of Libertarian political and social theory, according to its website. Agents made a connection between Ulbricht and Silk Road: In justifying the site\u2019s existence, its webmaster made regular references to Austrian economic theory and the teachings of Mises. The New York FBI agents weren\u2019t the only lawmen gunning for Silk Road. In April 2012, a federal agent in Maryland began communicating with Dread Pirate Roberts in an undercover capacity, posing as a drug dealer. In January, the undercover agent completed the sale of cocaine to a Silk Road employee and was paid the equivalent of $27,000 in Bitcoin currency. According to the Maryland indictment, DPR soon learned that the employee who received the cocaine had been arrested. The Silk Road founder expressed outrage, claiming the employee had stolen money from him. Then, by e-mail, DPR asked the undercover agent to \u201cbeat up\u201d the employee to recover the stolen funds, and later asked the agent to murder the employee, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, the undercover agent led DPR to believe that the employee had been executed. DPR\u2019s response, via e-mail, was \u201cI\u2019m pissed I had to kill him\u2026but what\u2019s done is done... I just wish more people had some integrity.\u201d Meanwhile, on July 10 of this year, customs officials intercepted the package from Canada as part of what the complaint characterized as a routine inspection. The package, addressed to an apartment on 15th Street in San Francisco, contained nine counterfeit IDs, each in a different name, but all featuring a photo of the same person. On July 23, 2013, with the cooperation of a foreign country not identified in the complaint, the FBI succeeded in getting a scan of the Silk Road web server. Tarbell\u2019s team in New York tracked the Silk Road webmaster\u2019s online logins to an Internet caf\xe9 on Laguna Street in San Francisco, near an apartment where Ulbricht had moved. On July 26, agents from Homeland Security Investigations arrived at the 15th Street address. There, according to the complaint, they encountered Ulbricht, whose photo matched those on all nine fake IDs. Confronted with a fake California driver\u2019s license bearing his photo and birthdate but a different name, Ulbricht avoided answering questions about the purchase of false IDs, according to the complaint. Instead, he volunteered that \u201chypothetically\u201d anyone could go onto a website named Silk Road and purchase any drugs or counterfeit IDs they wanted. The Homeland Security agents didn\u2019t make an arrest. Following the confrontation, Tarbell and his team learned that in the weeks leading up to the discovery of the counterfeit identity papers, Dread Pirate Roberts had sent a series of private e-mails suggesting that he \u201cneeded a fake ID,\u201d according to the complaint. In August, Forbes.com posted an interview with Dread Pirate Roberts that it said was conducted via encrypted messages sent through the site over the course of months. \u201cThe highest levels of government are hunting me,\u201d the cyber entrepreneur said, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t take any chances.\u201d Tuesday afternoon, Ulbricht surfaced at San Francisco\u2019s Glen Park library, a small branch facility. There, according to the person familiar with the matter, he was arrested by the FBI. In federal court in San Francisco Oct. 2, Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero read the charges against him: The drug conspiracy charge carries a potential life sentence and $10 million fine, while the computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering charges carry 10 year and 20 year sentences, respectively, and $250,000 fines, Spero said. Asked if he had any questions, Ulbricht referred not to the magnitude of the charges, but to a detail of the administration of justice. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what a special assessment is,\u201d Ulbricht said. Spero explained that each charge carries a $100 assessment fee. Ulbricht said he couldn\u2019t afford an attorney in San Francisco and was appointed a federal public defender. Ulbricht didn\u2019t enter a plea and was remanded back to the U.S. marshals after the five-minute hearing. Within 24 hours of Ulbricht\u2019s court appearance, information about him was pulled down from the Internet, including a 2012 video in that shows Ulbricht and a friend discussing his move that year to San Francisco. In the video, viewed Oct. 2 on YouTube, Ulbricht and a longtime friend, Rene Pinnell, talked about why they moved to San Francisco. The two kid each other about their adolescent behavior in middle school and share intimate details about their relationships with girlfriends. Ulbricht also expressed concern that the United Nations was trying \u201cto create global rules and global governance\u201d of the Internet. He also said he might want to start a family.

The lawyers at the top U.S. derivatives regulator are using\na summary process that doesn\u2019t require a vote by the agency\u2019s\nmembers who are confirmed by the Senate, O\u2019Malia said in\ntestimony at a House Agriculture Committee hearing yesterday.  The agency\u2019s enforcement process \u201cis a clear abrogation of\nthe commission\u2019s powers and a violation of commission rules\nrelating to investigations,\u201d O\u2019Malia said in prepared remarks.  The CFTC\u2019s enforcement division has begun using new Dodd-Frank Act authorities to oversee swaps and futures markets,\nwhile bringing a series of recent enforcement cases to ensure\ncustomer funds are adequately protected.  At the Securities and Exchange Commission, attorneys\npreviously required approval to open formal investigations and\nissue subpoenas. When Mary Schapiro took over the agency\u2019s helm\nin 2009, she delegated subpoena authority to the enforcement\ndivision, saying the approval process unnecessarily slowed\ninvestigations.  Bart Chilton, one of three Democratic members of the CFTC,\nsaid the enforcement division\u2019s policy is long-standing.\nRepresentative Frank D. Lucas, the Oklahoma Republican who leads\nthe agriculture panel, said he was concerned by the CFTC\u2019s\nenforcement process. \u201cThe requirement to vote on key actions\nshould not be disregarded,\u201d Lucas said at the hearing.  The U.S. Congress should rein in banks\u2019 ability to own and\ntrade raw materials or risk another financial collapse, Joshua\nRosner of Graham Fisher & Co. said at a Senate subcommittee\nhearing yesterday.  The Federal Reserve said last week that it\u2019s reviewing a\ndecade-old ruling that lets banks deal in physical assets like\nmetal and oil, potentially putting commodity units of JPMorgan\nChase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in\njeopardy. A Senate Banking Committee subcommittee yesterday\nconsidered whether laws and regulations that have allowed banks\nto own, store and transport raw materials are hurting\ncompetition and endangering the financial system.  The panel is led by U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio\nDemocrat, who is among lawmakers and regulators who say banks\ncan drive up prices when they control both the physical products\nand the financing. Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat,\nsaid the arrangement may allow banks to \u201cput a thumb on the\nscale\u201d to influence supply and demand, and bet accordingly.  Banks and regulators probably will be called to testify at\na second hearing on their role in the commodities industry and\nthe Federal Reserve will need to be \u201cmore forthcoming,\u201d said\nBrown. A new hearing might occur in September, and he wants\nbanks, the Fed and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to\ntestify, Brown said.  Banks may get an unfair advantage because they can fund\nthemselves from the Fed and insured deposits, according to some\nof yesterday\u2019s witnesses, and Brown said he\u2019s concerned that\nlenders may be put at risk when volatile commodity markets move\nagainst them or disaster strikes one of their operations.

Europe\u2019s biggest banks, which more than doubled their\nhighest-quality capital to $1 trillion since 2007 to meet\ntougher rules, may have further to go as regulators scrutinize\nhow lenders judge the riskiness of their assets.  Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Plc and Societe Generale SA are\namong European banks that issued stock, sold units or hoarded\nearnings to bring capital, as a proportion of assets weighted by\nrisk, into line with new global rules. Now some regulators are\nquestioning the weightings, typically set by the banks\u2019 own\nmodels, and embracing a broader measure of equity to total\nassets known as the leverage ratio that ignores risk.  The focus on leverage is the latest effort by financial\nwatchdogs to prevent a repeat of the taxpayer-funded bank\nrescues of 2008. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,\nwhich sets global banking standards, is taking a closer look at\nrisk weightings after finding wide variations in a study of 32\nlenders, Stefan Ingves, the group\u2019s chairman, said this month.  Regulators say the leverage ratio provides a safeguard\nagainst the potential for gaming risk-based rules, which allow\nbanks to assign weightings depending on how they judge the\nsafety of assets on their balance sheets. Government bonds or\nloans to borrowers with good credit require little or no\ncapital, while riskier assets such as subprime debt command a\nhigher allocation.  Under current Basel leverage proposals, banks would have to\nhold equity equal to 3 percent of total assets by 2018. While\nthe EU has said the rule needs more study, the U.K. and\nSwitzerland are following a similar path as the U.S., where\nregulators this month proposed ordering eight of the largest\nlenders to hold capital equivalent to 5 percent of assets at\ntheir parent companies and 6 percent at their banking units.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Britain\u2019s biggest\ngovernment-owned lender, was fined 5.6 million pounds ($8.6\nmillion) for incorrectly reporting wholesale trades for six\nyears.  The bank failed to properly report about 37 percent of the\ntotal number of trades, which included over-the-counter\nderivatives transactions, from 2007 through 2013, the Financial\nConduct Authority said in a statement on its website today. RBS\nbroke reporting rules on 44.8 million deals, and completely\nfailed to report another 804,000, the regulator said.  Global regulators have sought to bolster oversight of the\nswaps market after largely unregulated trades helped fuel the\n2008 credit crisis and led to the rescue of American\nInternational Group Inc., a U.S.-based insurer that booked large\namounts of swaps trades in Europe.  The rule breach was the result of a problem with the bank\u2019s\nsystems and controls, which \u201cwere compounded by the takeover of\nABN Amro Bank NV in October 2007,\u201d the FCA said.  The Edinburgh-based lender earned a 30 percent discount on\nits fine for cooperating with the regulator at an early stage in\nthe investigation.  \u201cWe regret the failings that were uncovered and have\nsubsequently made significant investments to our systems and\ncontrols in this area,\u201d Sarah Small, an RBS spokeswoman, said\nin an e-mailed statement.  Australia\u2019s securities regulator will attend analyst\nmeetings at about 20 companies next month as part of a clampdown\non selective briefings, after questions were raised about broker\ncoverage of Newcrest Mining Ltd.  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission will\nalso listen in on some one-on-one calls with analysts,\nCommissioner Cathie Armour said in an interview in Sydney\nyesterday. She declined to name the companies, saying they were\npicked to represent a spread of industries and locations and\nweren\u2019t necessarily suspected of any wrongdoing.  Newcrest shares fell 12 percent in the two days before the\ncompany announced a possible A$6 billion ($5.6 billion)\nwritedown June 7, raising concerns of selective briefing that\nhave been denied by the Melbourne-based gold producer. Australia\nrequires companies to disclose all market-sensitive information\nto the Australian Stock Exchange, and the Commission announced\nit would be running spot checks of analyst briefings July 7.  Companies suspected of selective briefing won\u2019t necessarily\nbe targeted for spot checks as ASIC would have investigated them\nalready, and some of the businesses were picked as examples of\nbest disclosure practice, Armour said.  Newcrest named former Australian Securities Exchange\nChairman Maurice Newman to head an internal inquiry into the\ncompany\u2019s disclosure and investor-relations policies, the\nproducer said on a June 25 conference call.  \u201cWe do not think we have done anything wrong,\u201d Chairman\nDon Mercer told reporters on the call. \u201cIf we have, we want to\nknow about it and I can assure you we will hold people\naccountable from top to bottom.\u201d  Newcrest Chief Executive Officer Greg Robinson said\ninvestor relations staff had held meetings before the company\u2019s\nannouncement and insisted that they acted in accordance with\nregulations.  Steve Cohen doesn\u2019t recall reading an e-mail on Dell Inc.\nthat was cited by the Securities and Exchange Commission as\nevidence that that the founder of SAC Capital Advisors LP failed\nto supervise his employees, according to a report given to the\nfirm\u2019s employees July 22.  While Cohen sold his stake in Dell after being forwarded\nthe e-mail, evidence suggests he did so because a portfolio\nmanager started selling the stock, SAC said in a 45-page paper\nthat refutes many of the facts outlined in the SEC\u2019s\nadministrative order filed last week against the 57-year-old\nbillionaire. There\u2019s no evidence Cohen ever read the\ncommunication, according to the paper.  The refutation, posted on SAC\u2019s internal website,\nillustrates Cohen\u2019s efforts to keep his employees calm while\nfighting the SEC\u2019s allegations -- the government\u2019s first against\nhim personally -- and its efforts to close down his $15 billion\nhedge fund. Cohen was accused of ignoring red flags in trades\nconducted by two portfolio managers, Mathew Martoma and Michael\nSteinberg, who have both been charged with securities fraud. The\nreport stated that at that time, Cohen only opened about 11\npercent of his messages. SAC argues that even if Cohen had read\nthe e-mail, the SAC report also says there were no \u201cred\nflags.\u201d  Martoma, 39, was arrested in November for alleged insider\ntrading in Elan Corp. and Wyeth. Steinberg was arrested in March\nfor trading in Dell and Nvidia Corp. Martoma and Steinberg, 41,\nhave pleaded not guilty.  The SEC said in last week\u2019s order that Cohen received a tip\nabout Dell that was forwarded to him by Steinberg, and that he\ntraded immediately afterward.  For more, click here.  Separately, the SEC\u2019s chief administrative law judge will\nhold a hearing next month into whether Cohen should be barred\nfrom managing other people\u2019s money.  Brenda P. Murray, who has been an administrative judge at\nthe SEC\u2019s Washington headquarters for 25 years, is scheduled to\npreside over the hearing on Aug. 26 at 9:30 a.m., according to\nan order filed in the administrative court today.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC, said last week\nthat the SEC\u2019s action has \u201cno merit\u201d and that Cohen will fight\nthe claims.  Murray has been an administrative law judge since 1975,\nfirst with the Interstate Commerce Commission and then with the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. She has been at the SEC\nsince 1988, according to the SEC news release announcing her\nappointment.  For more, click here.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued a Texas\nman over claims he operated a Ponzi scheme involving Bitcoin,\nthe virtual currency that has recently attracted investors\nincluding Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.  Trendon T. Shavers raised at least 700,000 Bitcoin starting\nno later than September 2011 through his firm Bitcoin Savings &\nTrust and improperly used currency from new investors to cover\ninvestor withdrawals, the SEC said in a complaint filed\nyesterday in federal court in Texas.  Shavers falsely promised investors as much as 7 percent\ninterest weekly on purported trades, including selling the\nonline currency to individuals who wished to buy it \u201coff the\nradar,\u201d quickly or in large quantities, the SEC said. Shavers\nalso misappropriated investors\u2019 funds for his personal use,\naccording to the complaint.  The SEC said the 700,000 Bitcoin that Shavers raised\namounted to more than $4.5 million, based on the average price\nof Bitcoin in 2011 and 2012 when the investments were offered\nand sold. Today, the value of 700,000 Bitcoin exceeds $60\nmillion, the SEC said.  Bitcoin is a virtual currency created four years ago that\ncan be used to buy and sell a broad array of items, both legal\nand illegal. The Winkelvoss brothers offered 1 million shares in\na trust that would track the price of Bitcoins, according to a\nfiling with the SEC.  No attorney was listed by the SEC. A phone call to a number\nlisted to Shavers wasn\u2019t immediately returned.  John Raffle, 45, a former ArthroCare Corp. senior\nexecutive, pleaded guilty for his role in a $400 million scheme\nto defraud investors in the maker of surgical products.  Raffle, who was a senior vice president of Strategic\nBusiness Units at Austin, Texas-based ArthroCare, pleaded guilty\nin June to one count of conspiracy to commit securities, mail\nand wire fraud and two counts of making false statements. His\nplea was unsealed yesterday, the U.S. Justice Department said.  He \u201cadmitted that he and other co-conspirators falsely\ninflated ArthroCare\u2019s sales and revenue through end-of-quarter\ntransactions involving ArthroCare\u2019s distributors,\u201d the\ndepartment said in a statement. Raffle faces a maximum of five\nyears in prison for each count, the government said.  Three other company officers were indicted last week on\ncharges they falsely inflated revenue. A fourth former\nexecutive, David Applegate, pleaded guilty in May to two counts\nof fraud.  The case is U.S. v. Raffle, 12-cr-00314, U.S. District\nCourt, Western District of Texas (Austin).  Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice\npresident facing civil fraud claims over a mortgage bond debacle\nthat made his client $1 billion, may say when he takes the\nwitness stand today that he\u2019s a scapegoat who was only trying to\ndo his best for the firm.  Tourre, now a 34-year-old graduate student, is scheduled to\ntestify before a jury in Manhattan federal court about his role\nin structuring and selling a 2007 mortgage-backed investment\nthat lost a group of investors about $1 billion when the\nmortgage market crashed. It will be his first chance to make\ngood on a promise, made before Congress in April 2010, to fight\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s allegations that\nhe \u201ccategorically\u201d denied.  Tourre\u2019s testimony comes near the end of two weeks of\nevidence against him by the SEC, whose lawyers will try to use\nTourre\u2019s own words to show he misled investors about the role of\nPaulson & Co., the hedge fund run by John Paulson, in helping\nselect the assets behind the investment, which it then bet\nagainst.  His best defense may be to emphasize his relative lack of\nstature at Goldman Sachs at the time of the Abacus deal, said\nJacob Frankel, a former SEC lawyer not involved the case.  His lawyer has said that Tourre\u2019s e-mails to his girlfriend\nin 2007 showed he was uncertain about what he was doing and\nprovided \u201can easy mark, a scapegoat\u201d for the SEC.  Tourre has kept a low profile since enduring the questions\nof a U.S. Senate subcommittee in April 2010 alongside other\nGoldman Sachs executives. He has spent part of the time since\nthen volunteering in Rwanda and working on a doctorate in\neconomics at the University of Chicago.   The case is SEC v.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring\ncompanies to disclose whether any \u201cconflict minerals\u201d are used\nin their products was upheld by a federal court in Washington.  U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins wrote that the\ndisclosure reporting scheme doesn\u2019t transgress the First\nAmendment and dismissed a challenge to the reporting requirement\nbrought by three business groups.  The rule is part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act overhauling\nsecurities markets and applies to certain minerals, including\ngold, tin, tungsten and tantalum, mined in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and neighboring countries. It\u2019s intended\nto help ensure that use of the minerals doesn\u2019t benefit armed\ngroups responsible for extreme violence in the region.  The National Association of Manufacturers, the Business\nRoundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce claimed the required\npublications on their own websites was compelled speech\nviolating the First Amendment. In writing the rule, the agency\nwas arbitrary and capricious, they said.  Wilkins\u2019s ruling follows a July 2 district court decision\nthrowing out another SEC rule, also required by Dodd-Frank, that\nmandated disclosure of payments by about 1,100 public oil,\nnatural gas and mining companies to foreign governments.  The measure applies to companies with SEC-reporting\nobligations for whom the minerals are \u201cnecessary to the\nfunctionality or production\u201d of an item they manufacture, the\nagency said in an Aug. 22 statement announcing the rule\u2019s\nadoption.  It applies to Apple Inc., Boeing Co. and thousands of other\nU.S.-listed manufacturers whose products use the metals.  The conflict minerals case is National Association of\nManufacturers v. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,\n12-1422, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit (Washington).  The payments case is American Petroleum Institute v.

Ex-SEC Enforcement Chief Khuzami Joins Kirkland & Ellis Law Firm  Robert Khuzami, the former head of enforcement at the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, is joining Kirkland & Ellis\nLLP.  Mark Filip, a partner in charge of Kirkland\u2019s government\nenforcement defense and internal investigations, said Khuzami\nwill help immediately in securities enforcement defense,\nadvising boards and companies and counseling financial\ninstitutions on securities regulations. He will complement the\nfirm\u2019s general white-collar, internal investigations, and\nprivate class-action securities practices, Filip said July 22 in\nan interview.  Khuzami, 56, will be joined by Kenneth Lench, who served as\none of his lieutenants at the SEC and headed a unit that\nscrutinizes financial instruments such as mortgage-backed\nsecurities and collateralized-debt obligations, Filip said.  Khuzami, a former federal prosecutor and top lawyer at\nDeutsche Bank AG, took over the SEC\u2019s enforcement division in\n2009 under Mary Schapiro. He carried out the biggest shakeup in\nthe enforcement unit\u2019s history, eliminating management layers,\nexpanding investigators\u2019 powers and creating five specialized\nunits to police Wall Street.  He held the position for about four years before stepping\ndown and was replaced in February by his deputy, George\nCanellos.  Under Khuzami, the SEC filed more than 150 cases related to\nthe financial meltdown, including 65 actions against senior\ncorporate officers, the agency said in January.  For more, click here.

Mythili Raman, 44, a career prosecutor and acting head of the criminal division for the past year, said she\u2019s leaving the department March 21. She makes way for Leslie Caldwell, 56, former head of the department\u2019s Enron Task Force, who was nominated by President Barack Obama for the post. Her exit probably won\u2019t slow prosecutions because other supervisors can handle the work, said Paul McNulty, a former deputy attorney general in George W. Bush\u2019s administration. \u201cYou hate to lose someone with her experience and capability because it really is extraordinary but things do go on without that person,\u201d McNulty, now a partner at Baker & McKenzie LLP in Washington, said in an interview. Raman spent 17 years with the department and was chief of staff to predecessor Lanny Breuer. She began a criminal probe into possible manipulation of currency exchange markets by the world\u2019s largest banks. \u201cBeing part of launching and overseeing this enormous investigation has been a unique professional experience and I think a really important point of financial enforcement for the department,\u201d Raman said in an interview. Raman said that the department is taking a lead role in the that investigation, which centers on possible manipulation of the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. She has trumpeted the use of cooperation agreements with banks including UBS AG and Barclays Plc over rate-rigging to speed up the currency probe. She said she won additional resources from Attorney General Eric Holder, such as money for staffing and forensic tools, to bolster the investigation. Raman oversaw the case against digital currency service Liberty Reserve SA, which officials said is the largest international money-laundering prosecution by the Justice Department. She also supervised an investigation into the credit-card breach at Target Corp. During Raman\u2019s tenure, the department won three of the 10 largest penalties for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including Total SA\u2019s $398 million resolution last year and Alcoa Inc.\u2019s $384 million deal in January. She also announced a $325 million settlement with Rabobank Groep and criminal charges against six individuals for roles in manipulating the London interbank offered rate. \u201cShe\u2019s quiet, she\u2019s effective and fair,\u201d William Baer, who heads the department\u2019s antitrust division, said in an interview. \u201cThose are great qualities in a public servant.\u201d Raman received attention in November when she and other law-enforcement officials helped bolster Bitcoin\u2019s value by testifying in the Senate that virtual currencies aren\u2019t illegal. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve taken good care of the division,\u201d she said. Raman said she\u2019s considering opportunities in the private sector and academia. She said she chose a departure date that would allow her to spend spring break with her 9-year-old twins. Veteran prosecutors have left the department in recent months. They include Charles Duross, now head of the anti-corruption practice at Morrison & Foerster LLP; Glenn Leon of Hewlett-Packard Co.; Joey Lipton, who\u2019s at JPMorgan Chase & Co.; and Stephen Spiegelhalter of International Business Machines Corp. Caldwell, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP in New York, was vetted by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month.

Inspired by the virtual currency\u2019s fivefold gain against the dollar in November, David Yermack of the Stern School of Business at New York University probed its historical trading behavior to see if it behaves like a traditional sovereign currency. His conclusion, contained in a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research this month, is that it \u201cdoes not behave like a currency at all\u201d and has hallmarks similar to some Internet stocks that collapsed in the 1990s. Introduced in 2008, Bitcoins have spread rapidly with about 12 million in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts. Their price soared above $1,000 earlier this year, compared with about $12 a year ago, according to Mt. Gox, an online exchange dealing in Bitcoins. Unregulated by central banks or governments, their rise this year prompted authorities to begin debating how to view them. To test the case for Bitcoin as a currency, Yermack compared it against the three major characteristics of money: that it serves as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and store of value. On this test, Bitcoin increasingly serves as a medium of exchange because more companies accept it, Yermack said. Where it fails is as a unit of account and store of value, he said. That\u2019s because its value is volatile and its exchange rate with the dollar \u201chas virtually zero correlation\u201d with how the dollar trades against other currencies. That makes \u201cits risk nearly impossible to hedge for businesses and customers and renders it more or less useless as a tool for risk management,\u201d Yermack said. Bitcoin also lacks other characteristics associated with modern currencies, in that it cannot be deposited in a bank, there is no equivalent to deposit insurance for holdings of it, and no lenders use it as a unit account for standard transactions such as auto loans and mortgages, Yermack said. \u201cBitcoin appears to suffer by being disconnected from the banking and payment systems of the U.S. and other countries,\u201d he said. The virtual currency is also hard to trade against, given no financial derivatives are based on it. \u201cSince currency investors have no easy way to bet against Bitcoin\u2019s appreciation, skeptics can only watch as optimists trade the currency among themselves at ever-rising prices,\u201d Yermack said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-23/bitcoin-more-speculative-than-real-currency-study-finds', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 23, 14, 10, 43, 725000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin More Speculative Than Real Currency, Study Finds'}, {'articleText': u' As a journalist, Ryan Selkis had his big moment last week when he got his hands on a document purporting to show that Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, had lost about $400 million worth of the digital currency, leaving its customers with little chance of recovering their lost funds. Because he is an entrepreneur, Selkis\u2019s focus has been on a product that would presumably have been very helpful in just this situation: insurance for Bitcoin accounts.  He is the founder of Inscrypto, which is still in a private testing period, and he declined an interview request because he didn\u2019t want his reporting on Mt. Gox\u2019s troubles to seem self-interested. Inscrypto\u2019s website describes the company as \u201cBitcoin\u2019s privately funded, decentralized version of the FDIC. We help you reduce or completely eliminate the risks of owning Bitcoin.\u201d  That\u2019s a tall order. The risks of the cybercurrency are legion, as this week has shown. Theft was a well-known problem even even before Mt. Gox acknowledged 744,000 of its customers\u2019 Bitcoins seemed to have been stolen as it filed for bankruptcy Friday. Because Bitcoin is more like digital cash than a bank account, it can be accidentally deleted or thrown away by those forgetting they\u2019ve stored some on an old laptop. Then there are the inherent financial risks, such as Bitcoin\u2019s extreme price volatility and the uncertain regulatory environment that could limit Bitcoin\u2019s use in the future.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation metaphor is somewhat fitting, given how much Mt. Gox seems to have been run like a wobbly bank from the original Wild West. Then again, the idea of the government insuring deposits of an anarchistic cybercurrency is about as unattractive to Bitcoin holders as it would be to the federal government. A workable Bitcoin insurance will have to emerge from the free market, and if it did, it would be vindication for the Randian mindset that inspires many Bitcoin enthusiasts. There\u2019s probably not a better time to test the idea.  \u201cA guarantee would be a complete market differentiator,\u201d says Angela Angelovska-Wilson, a partner at the law firm Reed Smith. \u201cMy hope would be that the Bitcoin industry would come up with something that is workable.\u201d The company furthest along this path is called Elliptic. Based in London, the startup offers cold storage\u2014a technique of storing Bitcoins on servers that aren\u2019t connected to the Internet and thus can\u2019t be hacked. Elliptic isn\u2019t selling insurance directly; instead, it says it has negotiated a policy with a large international insurance company and passes the cost along to its customers. When the company was launched earlier this year, it said it was insured through a Lloyds of London underwriter. But Lloyds says that was not true, and Elliptic has removed the mention of Lloyds from its website. Elliptic declined to name its insurer.  Tom Robinson, Elliptic\u2019s co-founder, says its customers are rich folks and financial institutions who deal in Bitcoins but don\u2019t want to worry about handling them. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t hold pounds or dollars, so why would they hold Bitcoin?\u201d he says. Peace of mind doesn\u2019t come cheap. Elliptic will guarantee that it won\u2019t lose your Bitcoin at 2 percent of its value per year, although larger accounts can negotiate cheaper rates. One twist: You can\u2019t actually insure Bitcoins, only a dollar amount. If you insure 100 Bitcoins at the going rate of $556 today, and they go missing next year when Bitcoin is worth (maybe) $1,000, you\u2019re getting only 55.6 Bitcoins back.  Catherine Mann, a professor of global finance at Brandeis International Business School, is skeptical about the prospects of Bitcoin insurance. Bitcoin itself hasn\u2019t been around long enough for startups to build serious reputations, which presents a challenge for an insurance model based on trust. And there\u2019s some reluctance among traditional finance companies to be associated with it, if Lloyd\u2019s exasperated response to a question about its alleged involvement with Elliptic is any guide.  Besides, people dealing in Bitcoin aren\u2019t exactly risk adverse, and insurance would mean that people who hold Bitcoin would see their costs go up. Now that a few companies are building insured Bitcoin products, it will be interesting to see whether people come to use them in any numbers. \u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d says Mann. \u201cInsurance is expensive.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-03/will-bitcoins-libertarians-pay-for-private-deposit-insurance', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 4, 21, 10, 42, 50000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Will Bitcoin's Libertarians Pay for Private Deposit Insurance?"}, {'articleText': u' A roller-coaster ride in financial markets, deal frenzy among Chinese Web operators spurred on by Alibaba\xa0and Tencent, the rise of Asian unicorns and a baking-hot semiconductor M&A spree: 2015 was a frenetic year for the region\u2019s technology sector. Fasten your seat-belts, there\u2019s more excitement to come in 2016. Here are a selection of predictions for the region from Bloomberg\u2019s Asia Technology team: Samsung\xa0will keep pushing the envelope on displays (a la the curved-screen Galaxy S6 Edge). Slick videos show that a plastic tablet-sized display can fold into a phone before getting tucked back into a shirt pocket. With the South Korean giant desperate to reverse a slide in earnings, 2016 may be the year this long-gestating technology gets unfurled. U.S. investors will tire of opaque Chinese stocks, so tech companies instead choose to list at home. The government\u2019s just re-opened a spigot choked off during the summer\u2019s market crash, jolting awake dozens of companies stalled on the IPO runway. Newly minted unicorns realize they can get a better deal from cashed-up, hungry Chinese than picky foreigners. Meaning \u201cBrazil 2016,\u201d the search term embodies China\u2019s growing love of international sports and its boom in online and streamed content -- both the licensed and unlicensed variety. Hosting the summer Olympics, Brazil videos and blogs will dominate a billion Chinese phones come August, six years before the country hosts the 2022 winter games. Carrying on a theme from 2015, expect China to keep snapping up semiconductor technology across the globe. Companies like Tsinghua Unigroup\xa0and China Resources Holdings Co. are already making a splash in the sector and, with President Xi Jinping keen to create national champions, there are more deals on the way. Samsung, Sony\xa0and HTC join Facebook\u2019s Oculus in the virtual reality space. Gaming will be the initial focus but it could find other uses going forward.\xa0 India\u2019s railway monopoly is also its largest online commerce player, with 20 million registered users buying 300,000 tickets per day and $2.5 billion in annual sales. It finally upgrades its clunky app and adds a marketplace to hawk more than just railway seats, heeding Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s call to go online, giving Flipkart Online Services Pvt Ltd and Amazon\xa0a run for their money. Japan, India, China and Russia all currently plan missions to the moon. Next year one of them will finalize plans for the first manned lunar trip since American Eugene Cernan stepped back onto Apollo 17 in 1972. Unmanned missions are scheduled, but landing a robot just ain\u2019t the same as a human planting a foot and uttering something profound. The Alibaba chairman\u2019s policy for dealing with the government is to fall in love but not marry. We\u2019ll see. As his company ventures ever farther beyond e-commerce into finance and media, it will run smack into thorny issues like politics. How the Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post handles anniversary coverage of the Tiananmen Square massacre will show whether Ma\u2019s having a fling with the government ... or putting a ring on it. Southeast Asia has minted a few startups in the billion-dollar club but Indonesia with a population of more than 250 million is glaringly absent. That should change in 2016 when interest surges in its bustling startup scene and flourishing economy. The smart money\u2019s on e-commerce with Tokopedia, backed by Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank, as the favorite. In 2014 it was a retired Californian engineer, in 2015 a Sydney businessman. In 2016 some other previously unknown personage will get identified as the mysterious creator of the cryptocurrency, known only by his nom de plume Satoshi Nakamoto.

They\u2019re both suspicious that governments are going to meddle around with normal money so much that it becomes useless\u2014it\u2019s just that one group thinks math is the antidote and the other believes in hoarding metal bars. This week has seen the emergence of two separate plans to have the best of both worlds. Ripple, a digital payments network that allows people to transact in a range of virtual and traditional currencies, said it had developed a way for people to transact in a digital form of gold. The announcement on Tuesday came on the heels of a company called Anthem Vault saying it had created its own virtual currency backed by gold, known (inevitably) as Independence Coin. Anthem Hayek Blanchard, who runs Anthem Vault, believes the time has come to convince believers in the gold standard that Bitcoin is more than a Ponzi scheme. Finally the two armies can join forces! \u201cWe don\u2019t need to fight. We can coalesce,\u201d he told Bloomberg News on Monday. Ripple, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t actually created a new currency. Instead, it has reached a deal with GBI, a precious metals provider, to allow people to buy gold that will sit in GBI\u2019s vaults for an annual fee of 0.5 percent of the value of the holdings. That stash can be used as the basis for transactions on Ripple, so that one side of the transaction spends gold and the other side receives Bitcoins or another form of payment. The caveat is that both parties in the transaction have to be willing and able to use Ripple\u2019s payments protocol. If anyone gets spooked, he can simply call GBI and it will provide him with the actual gold that has been backing his digital transactions. These ideas couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Bitcoin has been losing its luster as the basis of a weird social movement and speculative tool as the financial grown-ups get hold of it and the conversation turns to transaction prices and capital controls. Bringing the gold bugs into the party creates at least some potential for fun. \u201cYou could live your whole life in gold and make payments in Bitcoins, or dollars, or whatever,\u201d says Phil Rapoport, Ripple\u2019s director of trading and markets. It\u2019s all the convenience of Bitcoin (to the extent there is any convenience in using Bitcoin) without the Bitcoin risk.

The place is well outside the Miami party scene and its paparazzi, and is either purposefully retro\u2014deco chairs, white tablecloths, a waitress who must be 80 wearing bright coral lipstick\u2014or hasn\u2019t been updated in 50 years. It\u2019s empty save for one of the biggest pop stars in the world and a group of his associates, all wearing suits, and clustered at two tables. Pitbull taps his water glass, and the waitress hurries over to fill it. His lawyer, Leslie Zigel, hands him an agenda, which offers topics like \u201cEndorsement Deal Matters,\u201d \u201cInvestments,\u201d and, in capital letters, \u201cDISRUPTION.\u201d Zigel and Pitbull started working together in 2010, after Pitbull closed his first major sponsorship deal, with Dr Pepper, which Zigel was representing at the time. \u201cHe told me he appreciated my approach to dealmaking and asked if I would consider joining his team,\u201d says Zigel. \u201cI\u2019m a jazz bass player, and he liked that I thought like a musician, not a typical lawyer.\u201d Zigel looks like Stanley Tucci and speaks to Pitbull encouragingly, like a cheerful high school gym teacher. \n  After discussing a few of Pitbull\u2019s investments\u2014a restaurant chain called Miami Subs Grill that\u2019s undergoing storefront renovations and a water filtration system called EcoloBlue that Pitbull believes will be a \u201cgame changer\u201d\u2014the rapper moves down to \u201cMeetings\u201d and says, \u201cLet\u2019s do Bitcoin.\u201d Zigel slides over a stack of articles about Bitcoin and mentions a possible sitdown with Merlin Kauffman, who runs a $7.5 million Bitcoin investment fund focused on the hardware that runs the currency. Pitbull flips through the pages quickly, not displaying much interest. In public, Pitbull is rarely seen without an enormous pair of aviator-style sunglasses, but he\u2019s left them off for this meeting. His exposed eyes are ocean-colored, surrounded by little-girl lashes. Freckles dot his nose. There\u2019s a Twitter joke that compares a picture of Pitbull to Lord Voldemort, and while uncharitable, there\u2019s something to it, with that crowded, leonine smile and menacing cannonball-like head. \xa0\u201cI still want to know, what exactly is Bitcoin?\u201d Pitbull says. \u201cHow real is it? Is it going to be adopted and be disruptive?\u201d \xa0\u201cThe people who are going to adopt it are young,\u201d Zigel replies. \u201cIf it\u2019s something they decide they want to do, it\u2019s going to be a force to be reckoned with.\u201d\xa0\u201cWhat makes this real money?\u201d\xa0Zigel, looking unsure, glances quickly at the articles Pitbull has shoved back toward him. \u201cIt\u2019s very speculative right now,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s holding it together.\u201d\xa0Pitbull is dubious. \u201cNo gold, no nothing?\u201d\xa0\u201cNo banks behind it, no.\u201d\xa0\u201cAre they having problems with the streets?\u201d\xa0Zigel\u2019s eyebrows rise. Pitbull may be referring to the financial markets, or he may be referring to streets of a grittier variety. Pitbull, 33, spent much of his life navigating them, as he\u2019s quick to mention. He\u2019s a first-generation American whose parents came to Miami from Cuba, his mother in the 1960s as part of Operation Pedro Pan\u2014Miami\u2019s effort to get children out of the communist country\u2014and his father in 1980. Armando Sr. was a low-level criminal and drug dealer; he met Pitbull\u2019s mother while she was what Pitbull calls a \u201cburlesque dancer.\u201d By the time Pitbull was a teenager and trying to make it as a musician, he\u2019d dropped out of school and was dealing drugs. In 2001 he hooked up with successful rapper Lil Jon and producer Luther Campbell, the frontman for 2 Live Crew, and in 2004 released his first album, M.I.A.M.I. It featured the single Culo, which peaked at No.\u200932 on the Billboard Hot 100. Culo, which translates, roughly, to \u201cass,\u201d is what\u2019s referred to as reggaeton\u2014an upbeat sound that combines hip-hop, Jamaican dancehall, and more traditional Latino music such as salsa. In it, Pitbull raps in English and Spanish, and his style is hypnotizingly monotone, making it an ideal counterpart for a great hook. In the decade since, Pitbull has become ubiquitous and is moving into the territory of empire builder, along the lines of 50 Cent or Jay Z. His publicist, Tom Muzquiz, a peppy man with spiky hair who\u2019s lingering at the next table, promised to figure out the perfect day for us to spend together to help me understand his boss\u2019s reach and ambition. And it didn\u2019t involve a yacht or a crazy night out in South Beach or anything to do with his outsize lifestyle. Exciting for Pitbull, now, is thinking about things other than partying, studio time, and ladies. (He has six children with an undisclosed number of women.) This hotel restaurant isn\u2019t just where Pitbull asked to meet on this day, it\u2019s where he conducts business; he doesn\u2019t have a normal office, so he holds meetings here, sometimes jumping from one table to the other. The location is perfect for Pitbull, as it\u2019s private enough but doesn\u2019t deny him the pleasure of a Greek chorus of Yes Men. He asks that I keep it a secret. If it gets out, Muzquiz says, \u201cit could create problems.\u201d Along with Zigel and Muzquiz, the group consists of Pitbull\u2019s manager, Mike Calderon, and a few large, intimidating men whose purpose seems to be laughing when Pitbull tells a joke. At one point someone\u2019s phone goes off. The ringtone is Timber, Pitbull\u2019s most recent No.\u20091 hit, which features Kesha singing, \u201cIt\u2019s going down, I\u2019m yelling Timber!\u201d Pitbull rolls his eyes. \xa0\xa0Even if you don\u2019t know who Pitbull is, you do. You\u2019ve danced to a Pitbull song at a wedding or seen him in a commercial. He\u2019s sold more than 5 million albums worldwide in an era when people hardly buy albums, and his YouTube videos have exceeded 5 billion views. He\u2019s had nine top 10 singles internationally, including No.\u20091 hits such as 2011\u2019s Give Me Everything, featuring the R&B artist Ne-Yo. He\u2019s sold out numerous world tours and is teaming up in the fall with Enrique Iglesias. He\u2019s an endorsement machine, chalking up deals with Dodge, Bud Light, and Kodak. Like many hip-hop stars, he owns a vodka brand. His is called Voli\u2014it\u2019s low-calorie. \n  His songs are contagious, the kind of poppy club tunes that DJs play to get everyone on the floor. On his own, he\u2019s OK, but Pitbull\u2019s real success comes from collaborations with other artists\u2014song co-headliners include Usher, Chris Brown, T-Pain, Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, Christina Aguilera, and Pharrell Williams, among others. They sing the hooks, Mr. Worldwide raps through the bridge, and suddenly everyone\u2019s hands are in the air. He is expert at gathering up talent, and then packaging and producing the final product. Pitbull\u2019s got this thing of yelling \u201cDale!\u201d during his songs, which means, \u201cGo ahead!\u201d or \u201cDo it!\u201d or \u201cGive it!\u201d It\u2019s become a rallying cry for his fans, a kind of F-U to music snobs who might discount the rapper\u2019s slightly pedestrian rhymes. People want to have fun. Pitbull knows how to deliver it. Accordingly, Pitbull is rich. Estimates of his wealth range from $10 million to $20 million, most of that coming from endorsement deals with huge American companies. Corporations have decided that he\u2019s the answer to landing Latino customers. In 2012 the Latino population in the U.S. was 53 million, a 50 percent increase from 2000, according to the Pew Research Center. Latinos now account for 17 percent of the U.S. population and collectively spend more than $1.3 trillion each year, according to Nielsen. In the past month, brands such as Hyundai, ESPN, and Corona have unveiled national ads entirely or partly in Spanish. Colombian actress Sofia Vergara is now one of America\u2019s best-paid endorsers, with high-profile deals with Kmart, Diet Pepsi, and CoverGirl. Singer Shakira, also from Colombia, appears in ads for Dannon, Pepsi, and T-Mobile, and just signed a deal with Oral-B and Crest. Actresses Eva Longoria and Jessica Alba star in far more commercials than their middling careers suggest they should. Companies are scrambling to win this demographic, and Pitbull is eager to help them. \nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/hHUbLv4ThOo\n Being Mr. Worldwide does take a toll, though. In his restaurant office, he\u2019s constantly downing water. When the glass is empty, his eyes get manic. He\u2019s jittery, jangly, as if he\u2019s always about to jump up and run away. He looks 10 years older than he should, and his Miami Vice-inspired clothes don\u2019t help. For performances and public appearances, Pitbull wears black or white suits, sometimes with a tie, always with those aviators. Today he\u2019s in a blue pinstripe jacket and blue vest, the buttons straining a bit against his stomach. He gets up, returns, is ready to discuss the next thing, younow.com, a video startup, somewhere between Twitter and YouTube, that allows users to comment on videos as they watch them. His many partnerships and deals are brought to him, he says, by everyone\u2014his team, his investors, himself. \u201cSome people have amazing ideas, but nobody knows about them,\u201d he says. \u201cI partner with companies and say, \u2018You get here, then we\u2019ll step on the gas.\u2019\u2009\u201d He says he takes a rigorous approach to evaluating these possibilities. He does market-testing with children. \u201cI get these companies to go to the schools and say to the kids, \u2018What do you think about this? Do you think it\u2019s cool?\u2019 Then they\u2019ll start using it, and say, \u2018Did you think about this?\u2019\u2009\u201d He says he wants to be a billion-dollar brand in the next three years. That\u2019s a long shot\u2014neither Jessica Simpson nor the Kardashians are worth that much, though they both claim to be. Pitbull and Zigel discuss his YouNow appearance on May 28, when he announced his partnership with entertainment and TV production company Endemol. This is what Pitbull excels at: using one of his businesses to promote another. Zigel says the test went well and user engagement was high. Pitbull has 16.9 million followers on Twitter and more than a million on Instagram, believes in his own promotional power, and has had, as much as anyone in the pop-culture landscape, success in convincing others of it, too. In 2013, Chrysler signed Pitbull to help launch its latest entry in the compact-car segment, the Dodge Dart. Pitbull did two commercials for the car, one in English, one in Spanish, featuring him driving and offering the monumental swagger that has become his trademark. (In an ad for Bud Light, he makes an art form of merely walking through a crowd, capped off by what might be described as an epic lowering of a pair of sunglasses, followed by an historic grin.) \n  Juan Torres, head of multicultural advertising for Chrysler Group, says Pitbull draws two different kinds of consumers: millennials and Hispanics. \u201cHispanics are not only brand-loyal consumers but are loyal to this particular car segment. So in that case, the strategic alignment with Pitbull made sense,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when you start to peel back the layers, you see that 43 percent of millennials are multicultural, and so you have this incredible artist who resonates with all these different demographics.\u201d Torres says that since the commercials aired, the Dart has steadily gained market share, with 20 percent of its buyers consisting of multicultural consumers. Zigel and Pitbull move on to a proposed book, which they hope will create a bidding war among publishing houses. The title will likely be From a Negative to a Positive. \u201cIt\u2019s based on my motto,\u201d explains Pitbull. \u201cSince my mother started playing Tony Robbins when I was in the fifth grade, I\u2019ve applied that to my life and career. It\u2019s not only a business strategy, it\u2019s for everything.\u201d \u201cThe book is just the first piece,\u201d offers Zigel. They\u2019re thinking of a self-help lifestyle brand, with Pitbull in the Robbins role. He and Zigel discuss the possibility of investing in Vevo, the video hosting service that\u2019s co-owned by Universal Music Group, Google, Sony Music, and Abu Dhabi Media. Zigel has made Pitbull a flowchart of online streaming revenue, showing how artists and labels make money off video views. Pitbull studies it, squinting. Finally, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t understand this. I see a lot of f-\u200d-\u200d-ing arrows, and only two f-\u200d-\u200d-ing arrows to the artist. Something\u2019s wrong.\u201d \nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/hRQg4HfNIz4\n Next up: a premium sake called Rock Sake, which aims to make the Japanese rice wine cool\u2014like, bottle-service cool. Pitbull\u2019s interested, but he wants to get Playboy Enterprises, with whom he has a strategic partnership, involved. Playboy\u2019s waffling. \u201cScott isn\u2019t necessarily on board,\u201d says Zigel, referring to Playboy Chief Executive Officer Scott Flanders. Flanders, who ran Macmillan Publishers and Columbia House before joining Playboy in 2009, anointed Pitbull the company\u2019s artist-in-residence last year. \u201cFirst we did our own brand tracking, and he had the lowest negative scores of any superstar that was in our constellation of consideration,\u201d says Flanders, whose mission is to turn Playboy into a lifestyle brand that appeals to millennials. \u201cWe were quite surprised\u2014anyone with a rapper background will have passionate fans but also detractors.\u201d Playboy brought in PR and research firm Edelman to do an independent study on the star\u2019s appeal. \u201cThey found that the overlap of attributes that people associated with Pitbull and Playboy was significant, and we got a forceful recommendation to proceed with striking a relationship.\u201d The seven-figure deal grants Pitbull fees as a brand ambassador as well as a \u201csubstantial\u201d percentage of revenue from any licensed products. So far, Flanders is thrilled with the collaboration. \u201cThe interest from licensees has been staggering,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had no idea how hot he is in countries like India, where we\u2019re now doing deals. I talked to him about that, and he said, \u2018Oh yeah, I\u2019m hot there, and South America, too.\u2019 So we went to Mexico.\u201d Zigel\u2019s time is up. He stands, shakes hands all around, and goes back to the table of associates, where he does a kind of tag-team maneuver with Calderon, who\u2019s next in line. \n \u201cI partner with companies and say, \u2018You get here, then we\u2019ll step on the gas.\u2019 \u201d  Calderon is small and smiley, with a Latin accent and a suit that looks about two sizes too big for his skinny neck. As Pitbull\u2019s manager, he handles logistics and general tasks as well as other business ventures. Everyone who surrounds Pitbull ends up in charge of one company or another. Calderon and Pitbull go over security for Pitbull\u2019s performance at the World Cup in Brazil. There would be a helicopter and Navy Seals protecting him. Pitbull is pleased with this, which Calderon acknowledges with a small grin. Calderon also runs a site called shoppitbull.com, and he has numbers to report. \u201cThe first day broke $13 grand, which is great,\u201d says Calderon. \u201cBecause there wasn\u2019t any advertisement for it, only on Twitter and Instagram.\u201d \u201cWow!\u201d says Pitbull, before downing another glass of water. \u201cYou really need to keep an eye on that bad boy. That\u2019s your call to action! Now we come back and say, \u2018Look, our people, we know how to move \u2019em, and this is the kind of things we can do.\u2019 Congrats on that.\u201d With Pitbull\u2019s shiny tie and fuzzy, rapper-turned-entrepreneur-speak\u2014everything\u2019s a \u201ccall to action,\u201d a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d or has to do with \u201cmonetizing\u201d something or other\u2014it\u2019s easy to underestimate him. But Pitbull\u2019s longtime music manager, Charles Chavez, says the smartest thing about Pitbull is that he knows what he doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s gotten opportunities because of his music and has surrounded himself with advisers. And he keeps making more money. \u201cHe\u2019s just more intelligent than the average artist,\u201d says Chavez. \u201cHe\u2019s always watching Bloomberg TV! It\u2019s an ego-driven business, and most artists, it\u2019s all about them. He understands he can\u2019t do everything himself, and he soaks everything in.\u201d Calderon is done; next arrives Fernando Zulueta, a barrel-chested, deep-voiced businessman who works with Pitbull on his Miami charter school project. Zulueta has gray hair, a deep tan, and a large glass of red wine. Pitbull will be running his own New Year\u2019s Eve special on Fox, and Zulueta suggests hiring the Black Eyed Peas for the night. They move on to a startup, a kind of Spanish-language YouTube, which Zulueta promises will be like Pitbull\u2019s own TV station. Pitbull considers this and waves at the waitress for more water. The look on his face suggests he\u2019s about to say something profound, and he delivers. \u201cCulture is generation. Generation is power.\u201d \xa0\u201cExplain that to me\u2014because you use generators to make power, right?\u201d Zulueta laughs with a loud bark.\xa0Pitbull continues, straight-faced. \u201cWhen you become a generation\u2014say, the MTV generation\u2014that\u2019s where you create your power.\u201d \xa0Zulueta purses his lips, trying to understand. \xa0\u201cThe content fed the culture, the culture fed the generation. Everyone says content is king. But culture is everything. Content creates a culture\u2014the Kardashians created a culture.\u201d \xa0\u201cI got it,\u201d says Zulueta, though it seems like he might not. \xa0Pitbull has already moved on. In a few hours, he\u2019s due to get an honorary degree from Miami\u2019s Doral College and has to deliver an inspirational speech. Zulueta hands over a draft. It\u2019s about 20 pages, and the type is huge. Even so, Pitbull is displeased. \u201cThis is too long,\u201d he says, flipping through. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me. I need this to be the real me.\u201d Zulueta assures him he can do whatever he wants to the speech, and at that Pitbull goes upstairs\u2014to a room? an office?\u2014to edit the speech with Muzquiz. Over the next two hours, one by one, Pitbull\u2019s associates leave, until it\u2019s just me and the ancient waitress. When Muzquiz finally comes down, he\u2019s apologetic but explains the speech needed work. We head to the college. Instead of an Escalade or limo, there\u2019s just a regular midsize sedan. Pitbull, sunglasses finally on, gets in, and a cloud of cologne fills the small car. He hammers away on his BlackBerry. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and the president who use these now,\u201d he jokes. He\u2019s rereading his speech on the phone and seems a little nervous. It\u2019s silent except for when he gives his driver directions in Spanish and tells one of his guys that he\u2019s ready for his iced coffee. As we near the school in central Miami, Pitbull starts spraying himself with more cologne. First his Pitbull fragrance, then a bit of Tom Ford, then some Pitbull again. He explains, \u201cI mix it, and then depending on how the women react, I either mix the same ones again or try a different combination.\u201d On arrival at Doral, Pitbull is whisked away to don his graduation robes. His appearance is supposed to be a surprise, though some members of the local Miami press have found out. They always do\u2014he\u2019s their most famous son right now, and the city loves him. Reporters line up at the back door, waiting. \nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/C-dvTjK_07c\n Doral is both a charter high school and a tiny college, and there are probably 300 attendees in the auditorium, parents and grandparents fanning themselves with programs. Intros are made, and a very sweet high schooler gives a speech about how \u201cthis isn\u2019t the end, it\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d Then Zulueta gets up to introduce the mystery guest and recipient of Doral\u2019s first honorary degree. He speaks of this person\u2019s generosity and business acumen, and when he talks about his status as an international pop star, the crowd begins to buzz. Younger siblings elbow each other, and grandmothers sit up straighter. Pitbull comes out in his robe, waving and beaming, and everyone screams and whistles and whoops. He prances around the stage, enjoying it, his robe flowing behind him as he paces. The crowd finally quiets, and his speech begins. \u201cI did what they said I couldn\u2019t. I became what they said I wouldn\u2019t, and because of very special people in my life who believed in me, that\u2019s why I\u2019m on this stage tonight.\u201d Applause. \u201cSo with that said, I want to say thank you to my mother.\u201d More applause, mostly from the women. \u201cShe\u2019s someone who had to raise a man, a woman who made a man. But she\u2019s someone who taught me the No.\u20091 lesson in life, which is: how to survive.\u201d On paper, it\u2019s inspirational gibberish. But Pitbull\u2019s delivery\u2014the neat pauses between each clause, his staccato cadence\u2014transcends the clich\xe9d subject matter. The crowd is in it with him, rising and falling as he slows down and speeds up: He\u2019s turned it into a radio-worthy rap. The 20-minute oration culminates in a rousing call to let loose: \u201cI know you\u2019re going to get off the chain, off the glass, off the flip, off the rip, off the everything, y\u2019all going to turn it up.\u201d There\u2019s a term in electronic dance music called dropping the bass\u2014it\u2019s that moment when, after a brief letup, the beat returns full force, and everyone goes insane. The audience is waiting for him to finish, waiting for the bass to drop. And then it comes. \u201cY\u2019all go to all the parties you want to go to, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be plenty of them.

The band, composed of six Asian-American musicians, filed\nan application to register the name as a U.S. trademark in 2010.\nAfter a trademark examiner refused the application on the ground\nthat the term was disparaging to Asian people, the band\nabandoned that application.

Gox Co., once the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, won approval of its U.S. bankruptcy filing, giving a boost to a Japanese investigation into the disappearance of 650,000 units of the digital currency. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stacey G. Jernigan said today in Dallas she has \u201cample legal authority\u201d to accept the U.S. filing and recognize Mt. Gox\u2019s Japanese bankruptcy as the foreign main proceeding. The ruling empowers the company\u2019s Japanese trustee to examine witnesses, gather and review evidence, and oversee assets in the U.S., such as servers. \u201cThis is really going to be all about the customers,\u201d who make up almost all of the creditors, and trying to get them a recovery, Jernigan said at a hearing. Mt. Gox in February sought court protection in Japan after losing 850,000 bitcoins, then valued at about $473 million. Customers lost about 750,000 and Mt. Gox lost about 100,000 of its own. The company later found 200,000 in an old-format digital wallet. The exchange sought U.S. protection March 9 under Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code. Chapter 15 allows a bankruptcy court to protect the U.S. assets of foreign companies that are restructuring or liquidating abroad, help organize creditors, and enforce rulings from the foreign proceedings.

The online discounter moved a step closer when its strategy of using bitcoin-based technology won permission last week from the top U.S. securities regulator. The idea, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is to issue company stock using blockchain, the underlying software that governs how bitcoins work. Essentially, the blockchain is a public ledger that records all transactions for whatever instrument it supports, be it a virtual cryptocurrency or company stock. While Salt Lake City-based Overstock is an online retailer, Chief Executive Officer Patrick Byrne has embraced bitcoin with gusto, accepting payments on the Web store and speaking frequently on the topic. There\u2019s no guarantee the plan will work. Blockchain-based shares won\u2019t be traded on a public market, so there are questions over whether there will be enough supply and demand to form a market. Still, if Overstock\u2019s plan works, it could set a blueprint for how businesses sell shares in initial public offerings or secondary offerings. Using blockchain to distribute shares may also pose a challenge to the banks and securities firms that earn fees for handling stock offerings. "If any company wants to raise money by issuing a crypto-security, they could just copy the language in our S-3 and do their own filing," Byrne said. "We now have not just the language, but the actual technology." Byrne said he is still evaluating how Overstock might use the SEC approval for blockchain-based shares. He didn\u2019t detail any plans by the company, because the act of doing so would mean that he\u2019s disclosing an offering. Overstock can now issue as much as $500 million in stock and other securities through a digital trading system, according to the filing. In June, Overstock issued corporate bonds through blockchain, which didn\u2019t require SEC approval. The SEC decision comes as Wall Street banks, exchanges and startups ponder ways in which blockchain software and digital ledgers can reduce the time it takes to process financial transactions. Banks are looking at blockchain\u2019s potential to revamp the process of tracking ownership and transfer. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. announced earlier this year that it\u2019s testing blockchain technology for trading among privately held companies. By using such technology, stock trades could be settled almost instantly, instead of the usual three days. "This is the first glimpse of the future of equity trading," said Campbell Harvey, professor of finance at Duke University, who teaches a class on bitcoin and blockchain.

The presence of Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew as chair, flanked by his British and French counterparts, lends urgency to a resolution co-authored by the U.S. and Russia to tackle the revenue stream of a terrorist group that has extended its territorial reach beyond Syria and Iraq with recent deadly attacks on Beirut and Paris. A UN report estimated that Islamic State was earning as much as $1.7 million a day from crude sales. This latest push builds on an existing package of measures threatening economic sanctions against countries, financial institutions and individuals\xa0that help terrorists profit from trading oil, antiquities or hostages. The resolution to be adopted Thursday will revamp the existing Al-Qaeda sanctions committee to elevate Islamic State as a priority. Russia, the U.S. and its Western allies are conducting air strikes on Syria, where Islamic State has taken root, and are inching toward closer military collaboration in the wake of the Paris massacre in November. Closing in on how the self-proclaimed caliphate is able to exploit money transfer systems is now also coming under renewed scrutiny. \u201cThere is merit to the concern and the critique that financial regulators and institutions don\u2019t have an excellent handle on all the ways that Islamic State affiliated people are using the international financial system,\u201d\xa0said Elizabeth Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security who served as a senior adviser to the U.S. as undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence 2009-2013. \u201cThis effort brings another level of focus at the formal and informal value transfer systems at risk.\u201d If adopted, the resolution will require countries to \u201cmove vigorously and decisively to cut the flows of funds and other financial assets and economic resources to individuals and entities\u201d on the sanctions list. \u201cWhat we\u2019ll be doing is elevating ISIL, putting it on that same level, and turning those tools and that same experience that we\u2019ve built up internationally against ISIL,\u201d Adam Szubin, acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said on Wednesday, referring to the Islamic State by an acronym of one of its names.\xa0\u201cWe\u2019re going to be calling on countries to expand and intensify information sharing, both across governments, within governments and with the private sector.\u201d French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said he will with his European and American partners finds ways to establish global standards and rules for better regulating anonymous money transfer systems, such as the pre-paid cards, money remittances and bitcoin. \u201cTechnological advances are great but not at the expense of security,\u201d Sapin told reporters earlier on Thursday in New York. While Islamic State is able to generate significant amount of revenue through extortion and smuggling of oil and artifacts within the territory it controls, it is \u201cnot entirely self-reliant,\u201d Treasury\u2019s Szubin said. It is important to secure borders with Islamic State-controlled territory, and the Obama administration has done \u201ca lot of bilateral jawboning\u201d to make sure that countries actually adhere to their commitments to defeat the Islamist group, Szubin said. However, the new UN resolution would not penalize governments who don\u2019t. According to France\u2019s Sapin, the Financial Action Task Force will instead produce a list to name and shame those not doing their part. \u201cISIL are able to access banks outside their areas of control in Syria and Iraq, primarily through Turkey,\u201d Matthew Levitt, director of counter terrorism program at the Washington Institute for Near East. \u201cThe Security Council needs a combination of carrot and stick to get countries like Turkey to be tougher.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin has been the most vocal demanding consequences for\xa0Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

KnCMiner is expanding its own data center where thousands of its machines mine bitcoin and similar software by solving complex algorithms. The shift in focus comes after industry sales of hardware \u201chave stopped,\u201d according to KnC co-founder Sam Cole. After bitcoin\u2019s price collapsed from a high of more than $1,000 to lows of around $300 earlier this month, customers once eager to mine the digital currency have started to ask for their money back, Cole said. Yet the pullback by individuals who had hoped to grow rich in their garages belies the potential for companies that have built up the scale to stick the course, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still going to be $2 billion, at today\u2019s price, mined in the next few years,\u201d Cole said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of cash that\u2019s up for grabs and we\u2019re going to do our best to take a decent chunk of it.\u201d After raising $14 million in venture capital, KnC is looking at more locations in Iceland and Sweden as it aims to control as much as 20 percent of the bitcoin mining market, compared with the 5 percent it mines itself today. KnC is now trying to secure a second cash injection, targeting $50 million to build more data centers and develop new mining equipment. Cole says the biggest miners will end up profiting most as scale becomes increasingly important. KnC generates bitcoin at a cost Cole says is \u201csignificantly below $400\u201d per unit. The company does its mining in a helicopter hangar in Boden, a Swedish town near the Arctic circle, where it\u2019s in the process of tripling capacity. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t have these customers buy our hardware it becomes a different business model. It becomes much easier, much more open, much more honest,\u201d Cole said, referring to the whole industry. One bitcoin currently trades at about $388, representing a 47 percent decline year-to-date. There are 21 million possible bitcoin units that can be mined, with about 13.4 million already in circulation, according to blockchain.info. Since its inception in 2008, bitcoin has been linked to a series of corruption scandals spanning money laundering to payment to view child pornography sites. Yet proponents of the software are attracted by an absence of banking fees and the prospect of a decentralized alternative to fiat currencies. And despite regulatory challenges and other glitches, bitcoin has managed to attract sufficient venture capital to continue growing. The virtual currency is generated by miners who are rewarded in bitcoin for processing transactions by making complex calculations.

Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe appeared on Bloomberg Television with a message: Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn is wrong and PayPal is stronger as part of the online marketplace. Yesterday, just seven months later, Donahoe announced he has decided to split off PayPal as a separate company from EBay -- exactly what Icahn had proposed. What happened? Donahoe said he didn\u2019t exactly change his mind and wasn\u2019t pressured by his board to do it. Instead he was playing two games at once -- keeping Icahn at bay while assuring shareholders he was always open to the idea of a breakup. Working with Icahn publicly to split the company at the start of the year would have distracted employees, and it would have been done in a rushed way, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to a decision that was the same as Carl\u2019s,\u201d Donahoe said in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. \u201cWe made it on our own time, in our own way.\u201d The battle with Icahn wasn\u2019t cheap. It contributed to a nearly $100 million increase in EBay\u2019s administrative expenses during the first half of the year, corporate filings show. Icahn, 78, started the campaign in January, saying he\u2019d been buying shares and was nominating two directors to EBay\u2019s board. He called a separation of PayPal from the company a \u201cno-brainer\u201d in an interview on Bloomberg TV. Donahoe, 54, quickly dismissed the idea, arguing that a unified entity helps fund PayPal\u2019s expansion into areas such as mobile. The fight escalated in February when Icahn accused EBay directors Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook of conflicts of interest, charges that EBay founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar rejected as false and misleading. The dispute was settled in April when EBay agreed to add an independent director to its board while Icahn dropped his campaign to add two board members and force a PayPal spinoff. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to create a noisy media cycle in the first quarter,\u201d Donahoe said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose a very public, distracting approach. I had to deal with it at the time and dealt with it in a way to try to get it behind us.\u201d By June, though, Donahoe was seriously considering a split, he said. The company had started studying the idea in late 2013, as part of an annual review it has conducted since 2008. The rise in popularity of bitcoin, peer-to-peer payments, and the March release of new standards for payment systems that would expand their use in mobile devices had helped convince him that a separation might be the best course. Donahoe acknowledged speaking with Daniel Loeb\u2019s Third Point LLC and other large investors, including Icahn, about the decision to split. Icahn Associates Corp. owns about 2.5 percent of EBay as of June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Third Point, a hedge fund that also mounts activist campaigns, owns less than 5 percent of EBay, Donahoe said. \u201cWhen we came to the end of it, it was clear Carl was going to be an ongoing shareholder,\u201d Donahoe said. \u201cI don\u2019t like playing it out in the media but I respected his view and factored it in.\u201d Icahn, the 31st richest man in the world with a net worth of more than $23 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, would never \u201chave settled for only one seat unless he was pretty confident that EBay management was going to at least seriously explore splitting up the companies,\u201d said Ken Squire, who runs the 13D Activist Fund, which tracks target companies, and activist website 13D Monitor. \u201cWhile Icahn deserves credit for this, so does the board and management. They listened to their stockholders.\u201d In a statement yesterday, Icahn said he was \u201chappy that EBay\u2019s board and management have acted responsibly concerning the separation -- perhaps a little later than they should have, but earlier than we expected.\u201d Amid rising competition from new payments technology developed by rivals, EBay probably got a follow-up shove from Loeb when his Third Point amassed a stake, said William Meade, president of Billionaires Portfolio, which tracks activist campaigns. \u201cI find it hard to believe that they would do a 180 flip flop without someone -- whether it was Dan Loeb -- or they thought \u2018if we don\u2019t take PayPal and spin it off now we\u2019re going to lose half its value once Google and Apple get their payments technology together\u2019,\u201d Meade said. As an independent company, PayPal can pursue business with any company that\u2019s doing commerce around the world, even if they compete with EBay -- including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Donahoe said. Meanwhile, EBay can use its cash on acquisitions that will boost its own growth, something that up until now wouldn\u2019t have been justified because the money would have a higher return being invested in PayPal, he said. Donahoe plans to sit on one or both boards and may be the chairman of one of them, he said. He chose not to be CEO of either PayPal or EBay\u2019s marketplaces business because Devin Wenig, currently president of EBay Marketplaces, and Dan Schulman, who is joining PayPal from American Express Co., would do a better job running the separate businesses than he would, he said. EBay worked with Jim Citrin at executive search firm Spencer Stuart Inc. to find Schulman, Donahoe said. \u201cCarl was creating quite a bit of distraction in the media,\u201d Donahoe said. \u201cThe way you quiet things down is to put a counterargument out there.

The department cited as an example a blog post linked to Islamic State that proposed using bitcoin to fund global jihadist efforts. Almost 14 years after the Sept. 11 attacks, the government has made it harder for terrorists to use the U.S. and international banking system.

That\u2019s the main message from former U.S. intelligence officials, who in a report today outlined scenarios for how $445 billion a year in trade theft due to computer hackers will worsen. They warned that financial companies, retailers and energy companies are at risk from thieves who are becoming more sophisticated at pilfering data from their servers. The outlook \u201cis increased losses and slower growth,\u201d with no \u201ccredible scenario in which cybercrime losses diminish,\u201d according to the report published by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Some of the damage will be hard to trace, such as economic downturns caused by foreign competitors selling products based on stolen designs and financial markets undermined by hackers. \u201cCybercrime is here to stay,\u201d said Stewart Baker, a lead author of the study who was general counsel for the National Security Agency in the 1990s and later an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThe real question is do we know what cybercrime is costing us?\u201d he asked in a telephone interview. The damage done already includes 40 million people in the U.S. having their personal information stolen within the last year and an unnamed oil company losing hundreds of millions of dollars in business opportunities when hackers obtained its oilfield exploration data, according to the report. Network security company McAfee Inc. sponsored the report for CSIS, a nonprofit Washington-based policy research organization. Online crime could result in the loss of 200,000 U.S. jobs and 150,000 European jobs, with the total cost rising to as much as $575 billion, according to the report. \u201cCybercrime is a tax on innovation and slows the pace of global innovation by reducing the rate of return to innovators and investors,\u201d the authors of the report said. The study is intended to provide a comprehensive estimate of the cost of global hacker attacks as governments and companies fight digital incursions that could have catastrophic consequences. U.S. prosecutors in an indictment last month accused five Chinese military hackers of stealing information from American companies that would be useful to competitors in China. The biggest driver in the cost is stolen intellectual property, said Tom Gann, vice president of government relations for McAfee, a unit of Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker Intel Corp. Trade secrets are stolen online by foreign governments, criminal organizations and company competitors who hire their own hackers, Gann said in a phone interview. The attacks are enabled by the growth of a sophisticated underground economy where hackers and exploitation tools can be bought using digital currencies like bitcoin. Companies sometimes don\u2019t know their plans have been stolen. \u201cThe man whose bicycle is stolen knows exactly what he has lost the next morning,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe factory owner whose bicycle plans are stolen doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s lost anything until his competitor\u2019s bicycle reaches the market.\u201d Hackers could break into company networks or the computers of their lawyers and accountants to steal information about pending corporate acquisitions and business strategies, the report finds. \u201cIt is increasingly likely that the hackers will realize they can also make money in trading ahead of the plan for a merger,\u201d said Baker, who is now a partner at the law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP. U.S. Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the House intelligence committee, said he too is worried about financial-market manipulation. \u201cWe have seen nation states on our trading networks and we haven\u2019t fully answered the question what were they going to do,\u201d Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said. \u201cClearly, they weren\u2019t going to steal it and run. But were they going to use that to manipulate the markets?\u201d The report puts cybercrime in the context of other malicious activity, such as piracy at sea and transnational crime. It found that cybercrime costs about 0.8 percent of global gross domestic product, compared to .02 percent for maritime piracy and 1.2 percent for transnational crime. To some degree, companies and governments accept cybercrime as a cost of doing business in the digital world, Baker said. That may not change until the costs rise above 2 percent of GDP, he said. Trying to pinpoint the cost of hacking attacks hasn\u2019t been easy and previous estimates have varied. Keith Alexander, the former director of the NSA, said in 2012 that U.S. companies were losing $250 billion a year through intellectual property theft. He said cyber espionage constitutes the \u201cgreatest transfer of wealth in history,\u201d McAfee estimated in 2009 that companies lose more than $1 trillion through data theft and cybercrime. The company turned to CSIS to come up with a more accurate projection. Estimates should be viewed with skepticism especially because the value of intellectual property can be exaggerated, said Jim Harper, a senior fellow with the Washington-based nonprofit Cato Institute. \u201cThis kind of report probably obscures more than it informs,\u201d Harper said in a phone interview. Not all crimes are equal. Baker said careful economic analysis and rigor were used by CSIS to develop the cost estimate, which may be understated because many hacking attacks aren\u2019t reported.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-09/cybercrime-remains-growth-industry-with-445-billion-lost', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 9, 13, 57, 49, 149000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Cybercrime Remains Growth Industry With $445 Billion Lost'}, {'articleText': u'  Senator Rand Paul, a free-market disciple who prides himself on bucking the Washington establishment, is preparing for a 2016 presidential run by courting the Republican Party\u2019s ultimate insiders: Wall Street bankers and other deep-pocketed donors.

Bush\u2019s secretary of Commerce, Bob Mosbacher. \u201cWhen you\u2019re building a company, you meet a lot of these investment and big-banker types,\u201d Morris said in an interview in Washington. \u201cI\u2019ve typically tried to introduce Rand to people who aren\u2019t otherwise familiar with Rand World, whether that\u2019s the \u2018establishment,\u2019 so to speak, or financial types.\u201d Morris\u2019s effort could transform Paul from a junior senator who relied on small-dollar Internet \u201cmoney bombs\u201d and his father\u2019s libertarian base to a presidential contender friendly with wealthy donors who can turn to their own networks to help him raise money. Their partnership also is the latest indication of Paul\u2019s decision to cut a path different from his Senate race and his Republican rivals on his way to the 2016 primary. In addition to diversifying his financial base, he has appeared before the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, historically black Howard University in Washington, and at the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, which is headed by David Axelrod, President Barack Obama\u2019s former political adviser. Recent Morris phone calls have led Paul, 51, to a Guinness-filled happy hour in Silicon Valley with Internet startup founder Garrett Johnson and 40 other techies, and to a quiet lunch at the Fifth Avenue office of New York billionaire-in-waiting and investor Herb Allen III. Both were impressed enough to write campaign checks. Morris\u2019s largest Paul event yet was a January fundraising dinner timed to coincide with a Rubicon investors\u2019 conference in Atlanta. About 50 friends and associates of the company dined at the $1.3 million Buckhead neighborhood home of its chairman, Lane Moore, who\u2019d met Paul through Morris in November. The junior senator from Kentucky talked about how his party must become more inclusive if Republicans want to win the presidency. He left with a $150,000 haul in campaign cash. \u201cHe\u2019s a go-getter who really differentiates himself. A lot of people offer to help, but then they wait for you to tell them exactly what to do. Nate just went out and started doing it,\u201d Paul said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s just connected us to some great people.\u201d As a boy, Morris was witness to the union politics of his grandfather, who ran the United Auto Workers shop of Louisville. His relatives, like a majority of Kentucky residents, are registered Democrats, who voted for Ronald Reagan and then the Bushes. He gravitated to what he saw as the core Republican philosophy of empowering people to make their own decisions and chart their own course. By the time Morris met President Bill Clinton during an American Legion Boys Nation conference before his senior year of high school, he admired the Democrat\u2019s political skills -- while finding his policies wanting. As a political science student at George Washington University in Washington, Morris mixed classwork with jobs on Capitol Hill. By graduation day, he\u2019d worked for then-Kentucky Representative Anne Northup, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, who is McConnell\u2019s wife, and the newly formed Department of Homeland Security. He used an internship to help elect Ernie Fletcher, Kentucky\u2019s only Republican governor in the past four decades. In his final semester at George Washington, Morris talked his way into a graduate-level course taught by Jack Oliver, the George W. Bush finance chairman who had become a legend among Morris and his political junkie college buddies. \u201cFundraising was the glamorous side of politics,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Jack had this real glitz. We all looked up to him.\u201d In a class of about 20 students, Morris stood out to Oliver. \u201cYou can tell some of these young guys are into it,\u201d Oliver said in an interview. Oliver told Morris he should try his hand at raising money for Bush\u2019s 2004 presidential re-election. Morris took the unpaid assignment seriously, camping out for seven months in his mother\u2019s attic, which he converted to a fundraising studio. He sometimes made calls from sun-up to sundown, pulling in more than $50,000 in increments of just $2,000 a check because of campaign-finance limits. He was a Bush \u201cMaverick,\u201d the term for a check bundler under age 40. Although his friends laughed at him for working so hard without pay, Morris said his time as a Bush Maverick shaped him. \u201cMore than anything, that has been helpful as an entrepreneur,\u201d he said. \u201cI can make a pitch.\u201d In 2007, while doing graduate studies at Princeton University, Morris decided to try his hand at business. A high school pal, Marc Spiegel, had an idea: trash. Spiegel\u2019s family had been in the garbage-hauling trade for more than a century. Although there are more than 7,000 operators, most of them mom-and-pop shops, the industry is dominated by two publicly traded giants, Waste Management Inc., based in Houston, and Republic Services Inc., based in Phoenix. The resulting enterprise, Rubicon, doesn\u2019t collect trash. Rather, it uses data to analyze how a client can optimize waste disposal, with an eye toward recycling. Rubicon matches those companies with smaller disposal businesses and then manages the contracts. The company, which is seeking its second round of capital investment and is closely held, can tap a network of about 4,000 waste haulers and has contracts with hundreds of clients including several Fortune 500 businesses, Morris said. He declined to name any. Morris said he thinks of Rubicon as the Uber of garbage, referring to the mobile-phone application-based taxi service, because it is disrupting a market. About a year after founding Rubicon, Morris called his fundraising mentor, Oliver, in search of corporate cash. Oliver made an investment and put him in touch with Matt Blunt, a Republican at the time wrapping up his term as Missouri governor. Blunt took the idea to Bush\u2019s former attorney general, John Ashcroft. The three now are members of Rubicon\u2019s advisory board, something that Morris said has given the company \u201ctremendous credibility\u201d with other investors. As Morris was building his business, he was eager to meet his state\u2019s newest senator. Daniel Bayens, a field director for Paul and childhood friend of Morris, made the introduction to the Kentucky lawmaker in July 2012. The entrepreneur and the senator chatted in Paul\u2019s Capitol Hill office. Morris explained his business and \u201cRand got it immediately. It\u2019s the same kind of out-of-the-box thinking he loves.\u201d Paul asked Morris and his wife to accompany him on a weeklong trip to Israel in January 2013, a journey that forged a friendship. After that, Morris started introducing Paul to friends, family and business acquaintances, including Allen in New York and Johnson in San Francisco. Johnson, 30, worked for then-Indiana Senator Richard Lugar and other Republicans before decamping to California to start SendHub. It\u2019s a software company trying to replace legacy landlines for business needs. \u201cYour average senator doesn\u2019t necessarily follow tech policy, but he clearly does,\u201d Johnson said, adding that Paul was a hit at the happy hour. Johnson had to turn people away to keep it small enough for conversation. Paul seemed most impressive on National Security Agency privacy issues and on Bitcoin, a digital currency not backed by any central bank. Techies cheered when Paul said he was looking into how his campaign could begin accepting the virtual currency as donations. These are young business people \u201cwho have had success but also have seen some of the trouble with regulations and tax law,\u201d said Doug Stafford, a top Paul strategist. \u201cThey haven\u2019t necessarily been political donors before. They\u2019re not 20- 30-year Republicans, so they want to be convinced by the issue and the person, not the party.\u201d Morris has already begun changing the makeup of Paul\u2019s donor base, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks political giving: He\u2019s the top Senate recipient of waste-management industry contributions.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-28/rand-paul-backer-trades-trash-contacts-for-political-cash', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 5, 28, 4, 0, 15, 1000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Rand Paul Backer Trades Trash Contacts for Political Cash'}, {'articleText': u'  Ross Ulbricht, the alleged mastermind of the $1.2 billion online \u201cblack-market bazaar\u201d known as Silk Road, attempted to arrange the murders of at least six people including a worker he believed had stolen $350,000 in bitcoins from him, the U.S. said. While the murder-for-hire plots aren\u2019t part of the government\u2019s indictment of Ulbricht, federal prosecutors in New York are seeking to use them as evidence against him at his trial set to begin Jan. 5. The alleged schemes support the government\u2019s argument that Ulbricht conspired to protect the criminal enterprise, prosecutors said yesterday in a court filing. The evidence collected by U.S. investigators includes electronic communications retrieved from Ulbricht\u2019s laptop computer, according to the filing. The topics include the suspected theft of the digital currency used on Silk Road. \u201cUlbricht solicited these murders for hire as part of his role as owner and operator of Silk Road, to retaliate against a former staff member who he believed had stolen bitcoins from the site and who he feared would provide information about the site,\u201d said assistant U.S. attorneys Serrin Turner and Timothy Howard. In messages discussing the possible murder of the employee in January and February 2013, Ulbricht said he sought \u201cmuscle\u201d to \u201cget to him quickly.\u201d Prosecutors said that Ulbricht asked in an online chat, \u201cAt what point do we terminate him?\u201d and spoke of the murder scheme in several conversations. A witness who is cooperating with the government has agreed to testify about the murder scheme, the U.S. said. Ulbricht is charged with a murder-for-hire scheme in a separate case in  federal court in Baltimore. Joshua Dratel, a lawyer for Ulbricht, declined to immediately comment on the government\u2019s request. Ulbricht also solicited the murder of a Silk Road vendor called \u201cFriendly Chemist\u201d who threatened to blackmail him by disclosing the identities of some of Silk Road\u2019s vendors and customers. That person asked Ulbricht to pay $500,000 or he would publish the information, prosecutors said. \u201cIn my eyes, Friendly Chemist is a liability and I wouldn\u2019t mind if he was executed,\u201d prosecutors said Ulbricht wrote in one e-mail.

Anthony Murgio\u2019s lawyer and prosecutors \u201chave had discussion regarding a possible disposition of the case,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Eun Young Choi told U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas in a Sept. 9 request to adjourn the case until Oct. 9.

Murgio has been linked to a group in Russia and Israel being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for theft of customer data from JPMorgan, according to a Sept. 9 FBI memo. Murgio and a college fraternity brother were linked to a hack last year of JPMorgan, according to an October FBI memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. The cyberattack compromised personal data of 83 million bank customers over three months. The charges against Murgio and Lebedev filed by the U.S. don\u2019t involve that incident. In addition to violating federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including failing to meet reporting requirements set by the U.S. Treasury Department, Murgio and Lebedev were accused of exchanging at least $1.8 million on behalf of tens of thousands of customers from October 2013 to January 2015. Both face prison sentences as long as 20 years if convicted for money laundering. Murgio is free on $100,000 bail. The case is U.S. v.

Facebook. AirBnB. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the $4.2 billion venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, has backed them all -- along with dozens of others. His latest project? Upending finance. Bloomberg Markets magazine interviewed Andreessen at the firm\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, California. \u201cWe have a chance to rebuild the system. Financial transactions are just numbers; it\u2019s just information. You shouldn\u2019t need 100,000 people and prime Manhattan real estate and giant data centers full of mainframe computers from the 1970s to give you the ability to do an online payment. \u2018\u2018You would not today, starting from scratch, invent any of these financial businesses in the same way. To me, it\u2019s all about unbundling the banks. There are regulatory arbitrage opportunities every step of the way. If the regulators are going to regulate banks, then you\u2019ll have nonbank entities that spring up to do the things that banks can\u2019t do. Bank regulation tends to backfire, and of late that means consumer lending is getting unbundled.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go backward. When people start doing things a better way, it kind of doesn\u2019t matter what the old way was. You can find people who will say that this is all just an arbitrage on the current trouble in the financial system, and I\u2019m sure the big traditional banks will fight back and try to get things outlawed. \u2018\u2018But think about the scenario of a loan officer talking to a prospective client. To software people, that looks like voodoo. The idea that you can sit across the table from somebody and get a read on their character is just nonsense. \u2018\u2018Lots of industries are changing in a similar way. There\u2019s been a qualitative approach, and now, there\u2019s a quantitative approach. Everybody who grew up in the qualitative approach hates the quantitative approach and considers it a giant threat.\u201d \u201cThere is a growing idea in Silicon Valley that there are sources of data on consumer behavior we can use to predict creditworthiness. These will be completely different than the traditional approach to credit ratings, which are tremendously imprecise and \u2018laggy.\u2019 PayPal can do a real-time credit score in milliseconds, based on your EBay purchase history -- and it turns out that\u2019s a better source of information than the stuff used to generate your FICO score. \u2018\u2018The hypothesis is that there are many other similar sources of consumer data: credit card bills, social-network behavior, potentially even search history. Lots of people, both in the big Internet companies and at startups, are trying to get at these large pools of data and figure out new ways to do scoring. What they all have in common is that they are all being done outside of banks. \u2018\u2018The minute any of these new credit vehicles can show any level of repeatability and reliability, the hedge funds come in and provide the funding. Hedge funds are very comfortable with analytic models. If you have sufficient stability, you can get leverage.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The startups chasing disruptive technology aren\u2019t working within the existing system. This is the cryptocurrency phenomenon. If it works, we can re-implement the entire financial system as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized system. We can reinvent the entire thing. \u2018\u2018Bitcoin is clearly in this category. With bitcoin, there are advantages to decentralizing the financial system in order to do commerce. For instance, you can make payments in all but four countries. So, on day one, you can use it all over the world. Forget about all the different currencies and banking systems; it\u2019s a truly universal way to transfer value. \u2018\u2018That also means we have the chance to radically lower fees. Most consumer transactions are weighted with a 3 percent fee; remittances run up to 10 percent, which I think is a moral crime. There\u2019s a big opportunity to take those fees out.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Bitcoin is like technology that\u2019s arrived from Mars, and so regulators don\u2019t know what to do with it. That\u2019s a good thing. What a lot of financial technology entrepreneurs will tell you is that if you\u2019re going to innovate in financial services, you want to do something so new and so different that the existing regulatory system doesn\u2019t know how to react to you. That is your window of opportunity. \u2018\u2018The problem with building a new product or service in the existing financial industry is that tens of thousands of pages of legislation and thousands of lobbyists are going to come down on you very quickly. \u2018\u2018We needed a new technology to have the wedge to be able to enter the market, to be able to justify all the work to rebuild the system. With bitcoin, we now think we have that wedge. \u2018\u2018Bitcoin is a classic venture capital endeavor: It will either work or it won\u2019t. And if it doesn\u2019t work, we will lose all our money. But if it does work, it will work in a spectacular way. Our investments will pay off 1,000 to 1 or 10,000 to 1 or some other crazy extreme, because these markets are so big.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018There are serious conversations going on at every single large financial institution. They\u2019re all trying to figure it out. The technology folks who work for the banks are very smart, and the trading floors have split between \u2018This is for real\u2019 and \u2018This is a joke.\u2019 Yet people are leaving those institutions to start bitcoin companies. We\u2019re seeing hundreds of bitcoin entrepreneurs. Some of them are brand new to financial services. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re in for, but they\u2019re excited.\u201d \u201cBitcoin had a chicken-and-egg problem. Speculation was the way to get the thing established. The speculators are doing us all a favor by valuing it at $500 or $600 or $800 because otherwise it would be valued at zero. Now, you can actually do things with it. With scale and time, the volatility will vanish. The designer of the system, I think, would say that the system is working perfectly. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re used to living in a world where you trust people and institutions, then it probably does seem weird and bizarre that you would trust something where you don\u2019t know who created it. But if you\u2019re in a world where you trust numbers and math and code, it doesn\u2019t matter. There is no appeal to authority. You evaluate it on the basis of the math. It\u2019s just math; it\u2019s completely open. None of us thinks we need to know who created it. \u2018\u2018As for security concerns, bitcoin is designed to work properly in an untrusted, networked environment. Take Target. As a consumer, there is nothing you could do about Target. Target blew it; their systems stunk. \u2018\u2018In a bitcoin world, things like the Target hack are not possible. The way a digital currency works is that it lines up the incentives to protect yourself with the consequences of failing to protect yourself. Bitcoin is a digital-bearer instrument: If you have the numbers on the coins, you own the coins. You can make payments without having to give any information about yourself, and everyone can double-check their transactions. If someone hacked into Target, they would be able to steal all of Target\u2019s money -- but they wouldn\u2019t be able to steal your money. \u2018\u2018For five years, many of the world\u2019s best mathematicians and computer scientists have been studying bitcoin and trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with it. They  haven\u2019t found anything yet. Every critique people have of bitcoin, so far, can either be answered with \u2018the designer anticipated it and has a solution built into the system\u2019 or \u2018there\u2019s a service that can be built on top to address the problem.\u2019 That\u2019s the magic of why everyone out here is so excited about it.\u201d Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Markets, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-07/andreessen-on-finance-we-can-reinvent-the-entire-thing-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 10, 7, 4, 0, 1, 20000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Andreessen on Finance: \u2018We Can Reinvent the Entire Thing\u2019'}, {'articleText': u'  The judge overseeing the conspiracy and trafficking trial of Ross Ulbricht, the man charged with running the Silk Road online drug bazaar, criticized several of his lawyer\u2019s tactical moves while blocking last-minute testimony from two defense witnesses. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest ruled Sunday that Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Dratel, failed to give the government details of the witnesses\u2019 testimony in time to let them take the stand in the trial, which started Jan. 13 and may conclude with closing statements Tuesday. \u201cWhy did the defense choose to proceed as it has?\u201d Forrest asked, before granting the government\u2019s request to block the expert witnesses from testifying. \u201cThis court cannot know.\u201d Prosecutors rested their case against Ulbricht Monday. After Forrest denied his request to throw the case out rather than submit it to the jury, Ulbricht told the judge he didn\u2019t plan to testify in his own defense. Forrest rejected Dratel\u2019s claim that her rulings requiring him to question government witnesses within the topic, or \u201cscope,\u201d of their testimony forced him to add a computer expert as an 11th-hour witness. The judge ruled that allowing the witnesses, an expert in computer-based currencies and another in cybersecurity, would be \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d to prosecutors and could delay the trial enough to risk losing two of the 12 jurors in the case. \u201cIf defense counsel truly planned his trial strategy around his ability to bend the rules and examine witnesses outside the scope\u201d of their testimony, \u201cthen he should have had a \u2018Plan B\u2019 that included complying with the rules,\u201d Forrest said in the opinion. The ruling questions other decisions by Dratel before and during the trial. Dratel declined to comment on the judge\u2019s opinion. Last week Forrest denied Dratel\u2019s request for additional time to prepare to question a prosecution witness. The witness, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, was called in response to Dratel\u2019s claim, in his opening statement, that Ulbricht made most of the bitcoins found on his Samsung 700Z laptop computer through trading in the virtual currency, not from drug-sale commissions. \u201cIt was reasonable to expect that defendant had performed the very comparison that the government then scrambled to perform,\u201d Forrest said. The former agent, Ilhwan Yum, and a colleague spent two weeks after Dratel\u2019s opening statement tracing bitcoin transfers recorded on Ulbricht\u2019s computer and on Silk Road servers, comparing them to data on Blockchain, a website where bitcoin transactions are recorded. Yum testified that he traced 700,000, or about $13 million of the 790,000 bitcoins found on the laptop, to Silk Road. In his opening, Dratel conceded for the first time that Ulbricht started Silk Road in 2011. He told jurors his client passed the site to others within a few months because of the stress of running it. Later in the trial, Dratel claimed Ulbricht was set up as a \u201cfall guy\u201d by Mark Karpeles, the former head of the bankrupt Mt. Gox Co. bitcoin exchange. Dratel claimed Karpeles was the true mastermind behind Silk Road. Karpeles, who lives in Japan, has denied involvement with Silk Road. He hasn\u2019t been charged. Forrest ruled in October that Ulbricht had failed to assert any personal interest in computer evidence that he sought to block on constitutional grounds. While the move allowed Ulbricht to distance himself from Silk Road, Forrest said it was impossible to consider his claim that his rights were violated and that the evidence should be kept out of the trial. The decision was \u201cparticularly interesting\u201d in light of Dratel\u2019s admission that his client did create Silk Road, Forrest said in Sunday\u2019s ruling. In the trial Monday, jurors were told by prosecutors that \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d who ran the Silk Road online drug bazaar for more than two years, asked a member of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang to kill a man who was blackmailing the site, if it wasn\u2019t \u201ctoo much trouble.\u201d The jury also heard evidence of secret online chats the government said were found on the Ulbricht\u2019s laptop. In a series of web chats, from 2013, Dread Pirate Roberts, or DPR, is polite and businesslike as he discusses murders, drug trafficking and a $500,000 blackmail plot against him by a site user called \u201cFriendlyChemist.\u201d Prosecutors claimed Ulbricht tried to arrange six killings, including the murder of a former Silk Road employee. No murders were actually carried out, according to prosecutors. Ulbricht, who isn\u2019t charged with murder-for-hire in New York, faces one such charge in Baltimore.

An undercover agent e-mailed the site and was told he \u201ccould not lose money in the investment,\u201d according to the complaint filed Monday in state court in Manhattan. \u201cAll you had to do, they said, was send them one bitcoin, and they\u2019d send you\xa0three\xa0bitcoins in return, within 48 hours,\u201d according to a copy of Vance\u2019s speech. \u201cWhen our undercover investigator transferred a bitcoin to the operator\u2019s bit-address, they kept it, and he never heard from them again.\u201d The price of bitcoin has fallen almost 77 percent from its peak of $1,137 in November 2013 to about $267. A federal case in Texas involving a $4.5 million Ponzi scheme was described by U.S. prosecutors in November as the first of its kind tied to bitcoins. Trendon Shavers, founder of Bitcoin Savings & Trust, raised at least 764,000 bitcoins by promising investors a return of as much as 3,641 percent, prosecutors have said. Instead, he used bitcoins from new investors to cover payments owed to earlier clients and paid for his own Las Vegas gambling and spa treatments, they said. Vance has been an instrumental part of law enforcement investigations into money laundering at large banks including BNP Paribas SA and Standard Chartered Plc. A year ago, Vance also testified at hearings convened in New York to discuss the regulation of bitcoins and other virtual currencies after the indictment of former Bitcoin Foundation Inc. Vice Chairman Charlie Shrem for money-laundering linked to Silk Road, a bitcoin-driven website allegedly used for buying drugs and other illicit goods. Shrem pleaded guilty and was sentenced in December to two years in prison. Digital currencies have been linked to money laundering in the case of Liberty Reserve SA, described by the U.S. as a \u201cblack-market bank\u201d that masked more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds. A manager pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy and operating an illegal money-remitting business, and seven people were charged by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in May 2013.

The government asked the court not to impose a mandatory two-year prison term for Hector Xavier Monsegur who, under the alias \u201cSabu,\u201d worked secretly as an informant and helped agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation prevent at least 300 separate computer hacks, according to a prosecutor\u2019s memo to the Manhattan federal judge who will sentence him. Monsegur, a former member of the Anonymous, Internet Feds and LulzSec hacker groups, began cooperating with U.S. investigators immediately after his June 2011 arrest,  Assistant U.S. Attorney James Pastore said. He then worked \u201caround the clock\u201d to inform on his colleagues, and even helped gather evidence in cyber-attacks on a foreign government, the prosecutor said. While federal sentencing guidelines, which are advisory, call for a prison term of 21 to 26 years, U.S. probation officials recommend a term of probation, Pastore said. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska is scheduled to sentence Monsegur on May 27. Evidence Monsegur developed with federal investigators while working secretly for the U.S. led to the prosecution of at least five hackers, including Jeremy Hammond, who was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for an attack on the intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting Inc., or Stratfor, and for interfering with eight other computer systems, Pastore said. The prosecutor said that before Monsegur\u2019s cooperation, he was the only member of a crew of hackers behind a series of cyber-attacks who had been identified by authorities. \u201cHad Monsegur delayed his decision to cooperate, his efforts would have been far less fruitful,\u201d Pastore said. \u201cIn fact, LulzSec had developed an action plan to destroy evidence and disband if the group determined that any of its members had been arrested.\u201d Monsegur endured risks and hardships because of his cooperation, and he and his family had to be relocated by the FBI when his identity as a government informant was made public, Pastore said. Monsegur was also threatened and menaced by some who incorrectly speculated that he assisted in the investigation and prosecution of Silk Road, the billion-dollar online website where customers used Bitcoins to buy and sell drugs, the prosecutor said.

And no hyperbole is needed to make the case that this race to make money -- scratch that, this race to make more money than the next guy and gal -- acts as a God to so many of us. The alpha and omega, if you will. It\u2019s the religion of our id that so often wins the holy war against the religion of our superego. So naturally when an event of biblical proportions happens, as was the case last week in the U.S. stock market, there are many explanations offered from drastically different angles as the preachers, prophets and pharisees take to the microphone and blogophone. If you watched the event unfold from the exchange-traded fund sect, you saw a computer breakdown that hit ETF values like a plague of locusts. If your eyes are on high-frequency trading or "price insensitive" strategies such as momentum chasing, volatility targeting and risk parity portfolios, you see the work of the black box. If you view the world through "Made in China" glasses, you see China; if you trade options, you saw the VIX choke.

We thought we found the fat finger that tipped over the Jenga stack in the original "flash crash" of 2010, only to find out years later that an alleged dirty finger was poking at it as well. This is not to subscribe to the nihilist view that no one ever really knows what\u2019s moving the stock market, but only to admit that sometimes we have no clue. Maybe it was one of the things described above. Maybe it was all of them. Maybe it was none of them. Sadly, for the polytheist, the best we can offer you on the Monday morning after such an event is a jumbled collection of mixed metaphors and half-baked analogies to help explain all those pixel losses, and pixel gains for the lucky few. And not to digress too much, but let\u2019s talk about those pixels for a moment. Not that there\u2019s a single thing to suggest that hackers had anything to do with last week\u2019s volatility, but would it shock anyone if they managed to cause even more damage? How surprised would we really deserve to be if we woke up one morning to find that our bank, brokerage, and bitcoin accounts had been zeroed out? In a sense, it seems like all our pixel riches exist simply because the balance between benevolence and malfeasance has not yet reached a tipping point in the hacking community. The burglars and state-sponsored spies of the cyber underground are prowling through every digital desk drawer, filing cabinet, briefcase and trash can in our shops, banks, markets and bordellos. We try to keep them out, just like we try to police the myriad players in our electronic markets, but so often they make our security teams look like a bunch of mall cops guarding Fort Knox. And best of luck with your gold and physical commodities, all ye preppers for the financial apocalypse. Let\u2019s hope you can get to the vaults and warehouses before the looters, once they\u2019ve cleaned out the supermarkets and gas stations. As for last week in the financial markets, should we be cracking down on the speediest and most aggressive drivers on the road? Indeed we probably should. But good luck catching them. Remember Joe Walsh? His Maserati does one-eighty-five. He lost his license, now he don\u2019t drive. He can\u2019t complain, but sometimes he still does. Life\u2019s been good to him so far. Our market\u2019s mall cops will surely now mount their Segways to chase after the rock stars in the Maseratis, while others will just be looking for clues at the scene of the crime. Lucky we\u2019re sane after all we\u2019ve been through. Anyway, there aren\u2019t that many days left in this summer of 2015.

Parents are dispensing allowances in bitcoins so their kids learn to be digital citizens. Marijuana smokers are buying buds from bitcoin-enabled vending machines. Consumers in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia are starting to use bitcoin to hedge against currency volatility. By far the most popular virtual currency, bitcoin was created in 2008 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, a programmer or a group of programmers. Most currencies are managed by central banks. Bitcoin has no central administrator; a network of volunteer computers validate transactions, which require encrypted electronic signatures. While advocates see digital currencies as the money of the future, bitcoin will have to overcome a number of hurdles, including concerns about security and price volatility, before becoming widely accepted. The first bitcoin users were mostly investors seeking to profit from the currency\u2019s wild swings, libertarians drawn to the freedom from government control and tech geeks who deem paper money and credit cards antiquated. Many bitcoin account holders continue to see the currency as an investment, although it has slid 44 percent this year, hitting a low of $361 in April, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which represents an average of prices across major online exchanges. Investor Andrew Fletcher, a 51-year-old office manager in Portland, Oregon, deposits $25 a month into his bitcoin wallet. Even so, he concedes, \u201cI\u2019m not putting all my savings into bitcoin, OK.\u201d In recent months, bitcoin has attracted a more mainstream demographic, says Lui Smyth, a researcher at University College London\u2019s anthropology department, who surveyed users last year and again this spring. In 2013, more than 42 percent of the 1,000-plus people who took the online survey professed to be libertarians and anarcho-capitalists, who favor the state\u2019s elimination. This year, some 22 percent of about 400 respondents described themselves that way. \u201cYou got a wider spread of age, a wider spread of gender,\u201d Smyth said in a telephone interview. \u201cPolitics has gotten less important in getting people to join.\u201d Another sign bitcoin is becoming mainstream: Last month the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. agency typically focused on mortgages, credit cards and student loans, warned about risks associated with virtual currencies, such as scams and hacking. Three factors are attracting consumers to bitcoin. The currency is less volatile. New apps and digital wallets make using it easier. And mainstream companies -- more than 75,000, according to payment services Coinbase and BitPay -- accept the virtual currency. Consumers can use bitcoin to pay Dish Network Corp. for TV service, Expedia Inc. for a hotel room and Dell Inc. for a PC. So-called Bitcoin Boulevards, where retailers accept the currency, have opened in the \u201cWorld Canal\u201d area of the Hague and Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where participating businesses include Mitchell\u2019s Fine Chocolates and Shawn Paul Salon. The blog TheBitcoinWife.com publishes articles about the bitcoin lifestyle. A book series called \u201cBitcoin for Kids\u201d explains the underlying concepts to children. Ten-year-old Jaden Shelton, who lives in Fairfax, Virginia, wrote \u201cThe Scary Blueberry,\u201d about a kid afraid to try new foods, and sells the book at a 33 percent discount to those paying with bitcoin; about 40 bitcoin users have bought copies so far, he said. Shelton\u2019s father, Zach, a 41-year-old project manager, has been giving his kids allowance in bitcoin for about six months. \u201cIf I was a father in 1995, I\u2019d want my children to learn programming and to navigate on the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cFast forward about 20 years, and we have this technology, where bitcoin as a currency is just one application.

In April, she and her husband bought patio furniture on Overstock.com Inc., in July a Dell gaming computer for the kids. \u201cI have a Ph.D. in English lit,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither of us has a technical background.

About 90 percent of Overstock.com\u2019s American bitcoin customers are male, who spend on average $240 per order  -- 35 percent more than than a typical customer, Chief Executive Officer Patrick Byrne said in an interview. \u201cUsually men buy electronics,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cThese men are buying more household goods,\u201d such as mattresses, vacuum cleaners and sheets. On the first day it started to take the digital currency, Overstock.com\u2019s bitcoin sales peaked at $120,000; they\u2019ve since averaged between $12,500 and $15,000 a day, he said. At Expedia, which began accepting bitcoins for hotel stays in June, travelers \u201care booking nicer hotels and booking maybe a few extra nights,\u201d said Michael Gulmann, the travel site\u2019s vice president of global product. Many merchants are luring bitcoiners with discounts. In one promotion, Dell knocked $150 off Alienware computer systems. Electronics Web merchant Newegg Inc. offered users $75 off purchases of $300 or more and $150 off orders of over $500. Marijuana dispensaries can\u2019t legally accept credit cards. So American Green Inc., a Tempe, Arizona-based manufacturer of sustainable machinery and electronics, began leasing bitcoin vending machines to dispensaries in June. The company has two machines in the field, 12 more soon to be deployed and 15 more likely to be leased soon, said American Green President Stephen Shearin. The target customer: millennials who disdain cash. \u201cMillennials medicating with cannabis may be a matching demographic for bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cThe utilization of bitcoin will grow faster with people between 21 and 40.\u201d Bitcoin is catching on outside the U.S., too. If anything, using the currency to buy goods and services is even more popular in Europe, said Tony Gallippi, CEO of BitPay, which is based in Atlanta. \u201cThe adoption of the Euro is a really good parallel to the adoption of bitcoin, it\u2019s fresh in their mind,\u201d he said. \u201cAdding a new currency for them is a very easy task.\u201d Peter Surda, an economist who lives in Vienna, uses bitcoin two or three times a week to buy everything from food to electronics to plane tickets. \u201cSpending bitcoin did indeed become easier because more merchants accept it,\u201d Surda said in an e-mail. \u201cAlso various integration services do the purchases on your behalf even if the merchants have no idea what bitcoin is.\u201d CoinDesk\u2019s new Bitcoin Market Potential Index ranks Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, India and Nigeria as the five countries most likely to see mass adoption, mainly owing to wild local currency fluctuations and the millions of people without bank accounts. Venture capitalist Tim Draper invested in Palo Alto, California-based bitcoin startup Vaurum, which is targeting emerging markets like India. Liberty Games, a U.K.- based company that sells arcade machines and pool tables that accept bitcoins, is seeing increased sales into South America, said Stuart Kerr, the company\u2019s technical director. \u201cBitcoin makes a lot more sense in emerging economies like Brazil and Argentina and Russia,\u201d said Nicolas Cary, CEO of Blockchain.info, a payment service. \u201cThe number of new sign-ups we see in Latin America is increasing. You are moving beyond the people  placing bets to people seeing value.\u201d The pace of global adoption will depend on regulation, bitcoin\u2019s price moves and addressing security concerns. Price volatility is a major worry because the price can be influenced by a relative small group of owners. While programmers build services such as insurance into the system, bitcoin may be less secure than more established forms of payment. Once a bitcoin changes hands, there are few means to get it back. Meanwhile, hackers are on the prowl. Earlier this year, Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox lost 650,000 bitcoins to cyber criminals. This summer, a hacker stole 1,270 bitcoins from Androklis Polymenis, a software developer in Greece. Polymenis posted a 500-bitcoin bounty to track down the perpetrator and says the hacker returned 462 bitcoins in exchange for having the bounty lifted. \u201cThe problem with bitcoin is security and user friendliness,\u201d said Polymenis. \u201cHow can you expect mass adoption when I get hacked so easy?\u201d That\u2019s not deterring Greg Abbott, 35, who sells fried pies from a food truck in Portland. Sure, only four or five customers a month use bitcoin. That\u2019s not the point, he says. \u201cThe disruptive nature is what I like so much about it,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThis is a real opportunity to look at how money systems are formed. It\u2019s a real-world experiment of how these things work in the beginning of currencies.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-25/bitcoin-economy-widens-as-parents-pay-digital-allowance', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 25, 4, 0, 1, 9000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Economy Widens as Parents Pay Digital Allowance'}, {'articleText': u'  Yesterday was the climax of \u201c13F season,\u201d when big hedge funds and other investment firms must lay their cards on the table and show everyone what stocks they bought and sold in the last quarter. (Or at least show off the decorations with which they dressed their windows.) That means we got to see what Seth Klarman meant when his Baupost Group proceeded to \u201csift through the carnage\u201d created by the bear market in oil. Not everyone was sifting through the carnage, however. In fact one of the biggest increases in positions required no sifting at all: the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. Hedge funds bought more than 15 million shares of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust worth about $3.4 billion last quarter, according to data from 13-F filings compiled by Bloomberg. The ETF known as the \u201cSPY\u201d was the third-biggest aggregate increase in position by market value. (If you\u2019re curious, the biggest increases were Allergan Inc. and JD.com Inc.) The increase vaulted the SPY to the 10th largest position among hedge funds, according to 915 13-F filings. Take, for example, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, considered one of the most successful hedge-fund managers. As founder of the Robin Hood Foundation, he\u2019s guaranteed a good seat at the charity\u2019s investor conference where the boldest of bold-faced names on Wall Street gather to pitch investment ideas. So what did his firm load up on in the fourth quarter? Why the SPY, of course. Tudor Investment Corp. added 639,000 shares of the ETF, its biggest purchase in the period. And with a market value of about $133 million, it\u2019s the firm\u2019s biggest equity position -- three times the size of No. 2. What the heck is going on here? Weren\u2019t correlations supposed to break down and dispersions in returns supposed to increase, so didn\u2019t our broker tell us that it was time to get off the fence and start picking stocks again? That seemed to be the set-up in the hedge-fund world earlier last year, if the popularity of the SPY can be seen as a proxy. Funds in aggregate dumped the ETF in the first nine months of the year, making it the most unloaded position in the first and second quarters. By the end of September, it had fallen to the 24th biggest position in the collective hedge-fund portfolio, the lowest in Bloomberg data going back to 2008. Of course, these 13-F filings only give you a snapshot in time of how the windows are dressed at the end of each quarter. They don\u2019t tell you about all those other positions that put the hedge in hedge funds: the shorts, the futures, the options, the credit products, the Bitcoin and baseball cards or whatever.

That lost penny in sales, it\u2019s believed, is more than made up for by the fact that a $19.99 item sounds a lot cheaper than a $20 item. What about stocks then? The U.S. market has been steadily marching higher with hardly a second thought, like a hard drive churning out Bitcoins quietly in the background. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index closed last week at 1,949, just 50 points away from that 1,999 number. Its last 50 point move higher took about two weeks. Will going from 1,999 to 2,000 be just as easy as every other point it\u2019s added? It seemed like a good time to consult some Wall Streeters who\u2019ve been around long enough to have watched other round numbers come and go ... and come again. \u201cBig, round numbers matter,\u201d Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, said in an e-mail.  \u201cI am turning 50 this year and it will probably take until I turn 60 to get over that.\u201d He\u2019s not the only strategist who thought of his own mortality when contemplating the next milestone in equities. \u201cThe day I turned 60, I felt 10 years older than I did the day before,\u201d said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. Round numbers \u201care real only to the degree we believe in them but, in the case of the stock market, they can give us temporary hiccups.\u201d The S&P 500\u2019s troubled history with the 1,000 level is worth noting. The index flattened out as it approached quadruple digits for the first time in 1997. It rose above 950 in July 1997, but didn\u2019t top 1,000 until February 1998. It then dipped below 1,000 in September and October of 2001 before recovering above, only to fall below in June 2002 until recovering decisively above 1,000 in September 2003. Then came the financial crisis and another trip below 1,000 less than a month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\u2019s bankruptcy in September 2008. It tried to poke its head above 1,000 a few times in the following month before crashing all the way to 676.53 in March 2009. It reclaimed the milestone that August and made up its mind to stay above it about a month later, 12 years after its first taste of 1,000. Of course, those instances were marked by bear markets caused by the Internet-stock bubble and the housing bubble that triggered the near collapse of Wall Street. It took the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1968 to 1982 before it got comfortable with the 1,000 level, a prolonged period of \u201cmeh\u201d that included the famous 1979 \u201cDeath of Equities\u201d Businessweek cover. The Dow claimed 2,000 at the beginning of 1987 before the crash in October brought it back below. It didn\u2019t hold consistently above that level until the following September. The lack of euphoria now is \u201chow you know we aren\u2019t in a bubble,\u201d said Colas. \u201cThe missing piece of this bull market is the shoe-shine boy and the cab driver, to borrow from the 1920s and 1990s analogies for the last retail investor in the door,\u201d Colas said. \u201cWe make new highs and no one really seems to care.

Ulbricht set up Silk Road as an \u201ceconomic experiment,\u201d a \u201cfreewheeling, free-market site\u201d that he left when it became too stressful for him after a few months, the lawyer, Joshua Dratel, told jurors today in his opening statement. It\u2019s the first time Ulbricht has explicitly conceded his connection to Silk Road, which was shut down by federal authorities in 2013. \u201cRoss was not a drug dealer, Ross was not a kingpin, Ross was not involved in a conspiracy to do anything like that,\u201d Dratel told the jury of six men and six women.

In the film, \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d is a name used by pirates who pass the identity to their chosen successors before retiring on their plunder.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Howard told jurors that the case will take them into \u201ca dark and secret part of the Internet\u201d where users bought heroin, cocaine, LSD and crystal methamphetamine with the ease of shopping on Amazon.com or EBay. Ulbricht controlled every aspect of the site, which he ran from 2011 until his arrest in October 2013, Howard said. Ulbricht gave advice to drug dealers on how to package their products and required users to pay in digital currency to hide transactions from law enforcement, the prosecutor said. The Silk Road site used the TOR network, which hides the identity of users by routing traffic through multiple servers. Howard told jurors they will see chat logs between Ulbricht and his 10 Silk Road employees, to-do lists, a roster of the computers he used to run the site and a personal journal, kept on Ulbricht\u2019s computer, containing \u201cdevastating confessions by the defendant\u201d about his operation of the online marketplace. Jurors will also hear evidence that Ulbricht tried to arrange the murders of six people to protect the business.

He is charged separately in Baltimore with a single attempt to arrange a killing. \u201cHe was willing to stop at nothing to protect his criminal empire,\u201d Howard told jurors.

Tuesday\u2019s settlement is the first civil enforcement action against a virtual currency exchanger, FinCEN said in a statement. It enforces rules that FinCEN laid out in 2013 that required all virtual currency exchangers to register with the agency. Ripple sold its XRP, the second-largest virtual currency, even though it hadn\u2019t registered with FinCEN, the Justice Department said in a statement. Ripple failed to maintain appropriate anti-money laundering controls under federal banking laws, the department said.

While looking for lounge chairs on the celebrity-studded island, the Winklevoss twins ran into David Azar, a private investor from New York who recognized them and offered them his seat, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its November issue. Azar started talking about Bitcoin, the digital currency that has gained prominence this year for its wild price swings and for piquing the interest of regulators from New York to Germany. \u201cHe asked us if we\u2019d given much thought to virtual currency, and, at the time, we really hadn\u2019t,\u201d says Cameron Winklevoss, who along with his brother in 2004 sued Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg, claiming he stole their idea for the social-networking site. \u201cI got really fascinated by the implications for the financial world,\u201d Cameron says. Within weeks of their Ibiza sojourn, the brothers -- flush with cash from the $65 million they won after settling the Facebook case in 2008 -- started buying Bitcoins. They aren\u2019t the only ones to catch the Bitcoin bug. In the past six months, at least half a dozen venture capital firms that made fortunes from early contrarian bets on tech companies such as Twitter Inc., Tumblr Inc., Skype Inc. and Spotify Ltd. have put their money on Bitcoin. After dismissing Bitcoin as a joke for years, many Silicon Valley investors now see digital currencies as the next revolution to hit the Web after social media. In May, Founders Fund, set up by PayPal Inc. founders including Peter Thiel, led a $2 million investment in Atlanta-based BitPay Inc., which allows merchants to accept Bitcoin payments and is processing transactions totaling about $7 million a month. Also in May, after two years of wait and see, New York-based Union Square Ventures, an early investor in Twitter, put $2.5 million in Coinbase. Coinbase was processing $20 million worth of Bitcoins a month as of September, up from $1 million in February. Then Google Ventures jumped into digital currency with undisclosed investments in OpenCoin Inc., which started Ripple, a payment system using Bitcoin and other currencies. Like the Bitcoin investors who came after them, the Winklevii, as they are known, started small. They invested $1 million in BitInstant, a New York-based Bitcoin payment processor in which Azar was investing. Rowers who competed in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, the brothers say they began snapping up Bitcoins when the price was in the low single digits. It was a wise investment; one Bitcoin was worth $140.45 as of Oct 1. The Winklevosses, 32, say they own about 1 percent of the $1.6 billion worth of Bitcoins in circulation, making their holdings worth about $16 million. They say they see Bitcoin as a way around a sclerotic global payment system that is Balkanized into rival currencies and competing financial institutions. \u201cWe feel that digital currency, and Bitcoin for now, is a huge place for innovation,\u201d Cameron says. Bitcoin originated at the height of the financial crisis in November 2008, when a programmer or group of programmers known only as \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d released an academic paper outlining the design for a new peer-to-peer electronic cash system that removes the need to deal with third parties such as banks. A few months later, in a blog post, Nakamoto described the idea for issuing encrypted digital coins that were not tied to any central bank. Users store Bitcoins in digital wallets, with transactions recorded on the Blockchain, a public ledger that can be accessed via the Internet. The system Nakamoto designed caps the number of Bitcoins at 21 million. The open-source Bitcoin protocol has been tested by some of the world\u2019s top computer security experts, who have tried to hack it and failed. While anyone can see transactions made from a Bitcoin address -- a string of about 34 numbers and letters -- the owner remains hidden. The same goes for Nakamoto, whose identity remains a mystery. No central authority issues Bitcoins, which is part of their appeal to libertarians, who form a significant cohort of the virtual currency\u2019s supporters. Nakamoto argued that attempts to create digital money beginning in the 1990s failed because, even though these currencies were not issued by a government authority, they were centrally controlled by a company. One such attempt was E-Gold Ltd., a digital currency based on the precious metal. In 2007, the U.S. Justice Department indicted E-Gold. The following year, the company\u2019s founder, Douglas Jackson, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to engage in money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Skeptics say Bitcoin could fail, too. Some compare its appeal to the mania for Dutch tulip bulbs in the 1600s, when speculators drove up prices only to see the market collapse as investors rushed to sell. Others have branded Bitcoin fool\u2019s gold, saying a digital code can\u2019t be valued as a traditional commodity can. \u201cBitcoin will be the Esperanto of the monetary world,\u201d says James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University in Washington. \u201cMost people will see it as a fad like hula hoops, and they\u2019ll look back on it a decade from now and say, \u2018That was a clever idea. I even bought a cup of coffee with it once.\u2019\u201d Fad or not, Bitcoins are being adopted by a few merchants striving for cyber cred. You can use your Bitcoins to buy beer at Pembury Tavern in East London, cocktails at EVR bar in New York and dessert at Cups and Cakes Bakery in San Francisco. Bitcoin exchanges and payment processors akin to PayPal have mushroomed, luring users to trust often-unregulated third parties to hold and handle their digital currency. Regulators are cracking down on this Bitcoin free-for-all. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Ross Ulbricht, aka \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d the alleged founder of Silk Road, a Web site that the FBI says was a platform for illegal drug sales. Silk Road generated about $1.2 billion of sales using Bitcoins and $80 million in commissions, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in Manhattan Federal Court yesterday. Ulbricht was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering. The FBI seized 26,000 Bitcoins worth about $3.6 million. Earlier this year, in March, the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued guidelines requiring Bitcoin exchanges and processors operating in the U.S. to register with FinCEN as money services businesses. The regulations -- a costly headache for Bitcoin startups -- require companies to follow the same \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d rules that banks do and report suspicious transactions. In May and June, the Department of Homeland Security seized $5 million from two U.S. accounts connected to one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, for failing to register as a money-transmitting business. In June, Mt. Gox registered with FinCEN. In keeping with anti-money-laundering rules, it is now requiring users to verify their identities when they deposit or withdraw cash. In August, the regulatory onslaught intensified. Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, jumped in with subpoenas to 22 digital-currency companies and investors, requesting information on their Bitcoin operations as part of a fact-finding mission. The DFS is considering issuing new guidelines specific to virtual currencies. \u201cIf virtual currencies remain a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country\u2019s national security but also the very existence of the virtual-currency industry as a legitimate business enterprise,\u201d Lawsky said in a statement in August. On Tuesday, Lawsky said in an interview on Bloomberg TV that his goal is to make sure Bitcoin companies follow know-your-customer rules, not to \u201csquelch out\u201d Bitcoin. If regulation hurts the digital-currency industry dominated by anonymous transactions, he said, \u201cSo be it.\u201d In Germany, Bitcoin won a victory of sorts. Germany\u2019s Finance Ministry said in August that Bitcoin would be recognized as \u201cprivate money\u201d and would be subject to sales and capital gains taxes. Frank Schaeffler, a member of the German parliament\u2019s finance committee, lauded Bitcoins as a first step toward the late Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek\u2019s vision of a world with denationalized, competing private currencies. In the U.S., the regulatory chill has caused Bitcoin businesses to go into hibernation. In July, BitInstant said in a statement that it was suspending operations to sort out \u201cgrowing pains\u201d before relaunching -- casting a doubt on the Winklevosses\u2019 investment. \u201cThe BitInstant team is working hard to get its site up and running, and we hope that happens soon,\u201d the brothers said in an e-mail on Sept. 19. Tradehill Inc., a San Francisco-based Bitcoin exchange, announced in late August that it was temporarily suspending trading because of regulatory issues. It had registered as a money transmitter earlier in the month with FinCEN. However, its bank, the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union, said in a statement that it could no longer serve some Bitcoin customers until there is greater regulatory clarity. \u201cFor Bitcoin to succeed, the banks need to be on board,\u201d says Shakil Khan, head of special projects at music-streaming service Spotify, an early investor in BitPay and backer of CoinDesk, a Bitcoin news site. \u201cLiving in hope that the regulatory challenges will disappear is not a strategy.\u201d The libertarian wing of the Bitcoin movement -- many of them geeks in T-shirts who wouldn\u2019t look out of place at an Occupy protest -- say the U.S. government is bent on destroying Bitcoin. \u201cI recommend setting up in the least tyrannical jurisdiction, so stay the hell away from the U.S.,\u201d Erik Voorhees, founder of Panama-based Coinapult, which helps customers transmit Bitcoins via e-mail and mobile phones, said in July at a digital-currency conference in London\u2019s Canary Wharf. The currency has fluctuated this year, turning some young entrepreneurs into Bitcoin millionaires, such as 25-year-old Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader. After trading as low as $17 in January, the price of a Bitcoin surged to a high of $240 in April, spurred by the banking crisis in Cyprus. Bitcoin was behaving like gold, a store of value that tends to rise at times of economic or political uncertainty. Bitcoin believers say the currency is more than just an antidote to financial turmoil. In his office in Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron District, Union Square Ventures co-founder Fred Wilson compares Bitcoin with the creation of the protocols behind e-mail and the World Wide Web. \u201cIt\u2019s a scheme for computers to talk to each other that people can build on top of,\u201d says Wilson, 52, whose firm was one of the first to invest in social media site Tumblr and social-gaming company Zynga Inc. Bitcoin has many investors excited because they say it could challenge dominant players such as Visa Inc. and Western Union Co as a means of international money transfer. With no need for a third-party intermediary, users can send Bitcoins to one another for free. PayPal, by contrast, charges sellers 2.9 percent per transaction and more for international sales. Working from Flatiron offices featuring sleek gray sofas and exposed industrial pipes, the Winklevoss twins say they want to offer pension funds and retail investors a way to gain exposure to the digital currency without actually buying Bitcoins. \u201cThe driving force is bringing Bitcoin to the mainstream investor,\u201d Cameron says. In July, the brothers filed a 95-page application with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an entity called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund that would track the performance of the digital currency. Cameron says he and Tyler spent months on the filing with a team of lawyers at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, which helped draft the paperwork for the first ETF 20 years ago. The Bitcoin ETF idea is so far-fetched that SEC approval, if it ever comes, could take years, says Reggie Browne,  head of ETF trading at Cantor Fitzgerald LP. \u201cI think it\u2019s a riot,\u201d he says, laughing. The Winklevosses have competition in the race to snag mainstream Bitcoin investors. Barry Silbert, the 37-year-old founder of New York-based SecondMarket Inc., which became the biggest private market for trading shares in Facebook before it went public, is raising capital for a private Bitcoin Investment Trust aimed at institutional and accredited investors, not retail clients. SecondMarket invested $2 million in the fund, which launched in September. Silbert says the only way for Bitcoin to become a global currency is for trading volumes and overall market value to increase beyond $1.6 billion. Silbert began buying the virtual currency as a personal investment in early 2012, when the price was about $5 to $10. Then in the spring of 2012, he started the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund with his own money and began investing in startups, including Tradehill, the exchange that suspended operations at the end of August. He says he\u2019s invested more than $1 million so far in 10 companies -- and used Bitcoins to finance many of the companies he\u2019s backed. Bitcoin could go viral, Silbert says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to suggest it will replace the U.S. dollar,\u201d he says. \u201cBut can it have as transformative an effect on the world as Facebook? Yes.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s future is largely in the hands of regulators. By forcing companies that handle digital currencies to act by the same rules that banks do, regulatory authorities could draw Bitcoin into the mainstream like any number of innovations that are now embraced by the marketplace. Or they could break it, marginalizing it as a threat to financial integrity and spelling the end of what many hoped would be a digital-currency revolution.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-02/bitcoin-bets-feed-twitter-dreams-as-regulators-circle', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 10, 2, 23, 1, 0, 8000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Bets Feed Twitter Dreams as Regulators Circle'}, {'articleText': u'  Chinese central bank officials told third-party payment service providers to stop offering clearing services to online Bitcoin exchanges, according to China Business News, which is affiliated with the Shanghai government. Companies currently offering services must end services by the Chinese New Year, a weeklong holiday that begins on Jan. 31, the newspaper cited Zhou Jinhuang, deputy director of payment clearance at the People\u2019s Bank of China, as saying at a meeting with more than 10 third-party payment service providers. China\u2019s central bank regulated the virtual currency for the first time on Dec. 5 by banning financial institutions and payment providers from conducting transactions in the virtual currency. Zhou was cited as saying by China Business News that the rules would be \u201cstrictly enforced.\u201d \u201cThe PBOC statement on Dec. 5 was somewhat vague and there is more clarity now,\u201d Zennon Kapron, managing director of financial consultancy Kapronasia, said in an interview in Shanghai. \u201cThe way it\u2019s reading now is that after the Chinese New Year, you won\u2019t be able to get your money off the platforms.\u201d The PBOC\u2019s news department didn\u2019t immediately comment on the Bitcoin report when contacted by Bloomberg News. Two calls to Li Yue, director general of the central bank\u2019s payment and settlement department, were unanswered. Bitcoin prices on BTC China, China\u2019s largest exchange, plunged to as low as 3,251 yuan ($535) today before rebounding to 4,155 yuan at 4:16 p.m. local time. The drop in prices was triggered by concern that PBOC officials may visit lenders next to enforce the ban against Bitcoin settlement, Kapron said. The number of banks and payment providers that can transact Bitcoin has shrunk since the ban was announced, he said. Bitcoin prices on the CoinDesk index jumped as much as 11 times since October, prompting former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to call the market a \u201cbubble.\u201d Speculation that authorities in China may halt trading in Bitcoin surfaced after police arrested three people on suspicion of stealing money from investors through a fake online exchange. GBL, a Bitcoin trading platform in China that began operating in May and had 4,493 registered users at the end of September, abruptly closed on Oct. 26, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Dec. 3., citing police in eastern Zhejiang privince\u2019s Dongyang city.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-17/china-bans-payment-companies-from-clearing-bitcoin-news-says', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 17, 8, 52, 51, 857000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'China Bans Payment Companies From Clearing Bitcoin, News Says'}, {'articleText': u'  Klarna AB, Europe\u2019s largest specialized online payment solutions provider, is planning its first expansion outside the region as the company forecasts soaring e-commerce volume from retailers eager to let it assume their credit risk. Klarna, which operates in 14 countries including Sweden, Germany and Austria, is interested in both the U.S. and Japan, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in a Jan. 29 interview at the company\u2019s offices in Stockholm. Klarna wants to be present in all of Europe and also to expand globally. \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if we haven\u2019t launched at least one country outside the EU within one to two years -- a big country,\u201d the 32-year-old executive said. \u201cThere is enormous potential.\u201d Klarna\u2019s expansion comes as large retailers step up online efforts. Hennes & Mauritz AB, Europe\u2019s second-biggest clothing retailer, plans to expand to four new online markets this year while Ikea Group, the world\u2019s No. 1 furniture retailer, has said it will continue to add markets and expand the number of online products available growing its web shop presence to 13 markets from 10 last year. Klarna wants to make web payments faster and easier and in doing so, increase the number of completed transactions for online shops by removing \u201cthe hassle\u201d it says surrounds many payment solutions, such as typing in numbers from a debit card. By assuming online merchants\u2019 credit risk, it also allows customers to pay for goods after orders have been placed and shipped. To avoid losses, Klarna uses an algorithm with over 200 variables measuring client risk. They include previous purchases, the time of the day the customer buys goods, the frequency of purchases and even how shoppers type their names. Some 50 of the company\u2019s total 1,000 employees work with assessing customer risk. Klarna late last year merged with Germany\u2019s Sofort to gain control of 10 percent of the combined $100 billion market in countries where the companies operate. That number \u201cshould grow substantially\u201d in coming years, Siemiatkowski said. The company says that only 33 out of 100 people who proceed to checkout on a desktop actually make the purchase, meaning that almost 70 percent of customers disappear during the payment process. Klarna claims merchants get a 20 to 30 percent increase in completed transactions with its products. Klarna\u2019s payment solutions, available both on mobile devices and for desktops, are currently used by 18,000 shops, including book retailer Adlibris in Sweden. SAS, Scandinavia\u2019s biggest airline, is using the system for ticket sales as is Stockholm\u2019s subway system. Sofort\u2019s solutions, which provides direct credit transfers between shoppers and their banks, is used by more than 25,000 shops. Klarna, which was founded in Stockholm in 2005, uses deposits to fund its operations and has raised 2 billion kronor ($308 million) to 3 billion kronor so far in Sweden, Chief Financial Officer John Keatley said. The company also recently started taking deposits in Germany, he said. In Sweden, Klarna offers deposits via Avanza Bank, with an interest rate of 1.5 percent on three-month deposits and 2.6 percent on 24-month deposits. In comparison, the rate on six-month deposits at Svenska Handelsbanken AB, Sweden\u2019s biggest bank by branches, is 0.55 percent while the deposit rate on a SEB AB general savings account is 0.3 percent. While its business is based on innovative solutions and advanced technology, Siemiatkowski has no plans to start accepting payments in the digital currency Bitcoin. \u201cThe way we look at it, it is a bubble,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any practical application of it that is interesting in any larger scale.\u201d His comments echo concern among Nordic regulators, Baltic central banks and Swedish lenders. SEB, the largest Nordic currency trader, is rejecting requests from clients seeking to set up accounts to manage Bitcoin. No Nordic regulator recognizes the software as money and Nordea Bank AB, the Nordic region\u2019s largest bank, is advising customers to think twice before touching the currency. While Klarna, regulated by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, uses deposits to finance the credit it extends to shoppers, the company has relied on private placements to bring in capital. Sequoia Capital, DST Global and General Atlantic are among Klarna\u2019s investors.

Pascal Reid, 29, and Michel Abner Espinoza, 30, face two counts of money laundering and one count of engaging in an unlicensed money servicing business, according to court filings in Miami state court. Both men were arrested Feb. 6 and are being held in Miami-Dade County jails. \u201cThe use of Bitcoins in the transactions is a new technological flourish to this very old crime,\u201d Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said in a statement. The \u201carrests may be the first state prosecutions involving the use of Bitcoins in money laundering operations.\u201d Federal prosecutors in New York have filed a series of charges tied to Bitcoin since October. Ross William Ulbricht, known as the \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d was arrested for allegedly operating the billion-dollar Silk Road website, where customers used Bitcoins to buy and sell drugs. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial Nov. 3 in Manhattan. Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, has no central issuing authority and uses a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions. It has gained traction with merchants selling legitimate products but also has been used to facilitate illegal transactions. In the Miami case, undercover police officers sought out \u201cindividuals engaged in high volume Bitcoin activity,\u201d Fernandez Rundle said. In December and January, a Miami Beach police officer and a Secret Service agent allegedly bought $1,500 in Bitcoins from Espinoza and another $1,500 from Reid in separate transactions, according to arrest affidavits filed in the case. The officers found Espinoza and Reid on the Bitcoin exchange site LocalBitcoins, where Espinosa went by MichellHack and Reid used the name proy33, according to the filings. The undercover officers told both men they were using the digital currency to buy stolen credit card numbers. In February, Reid sold the Secret Service agent $25,000 worth of Bitcoins, police said. The Miami Beach officer tried to purchase $30,000 from Espinoza, but the deal didn\u2019t go through because Espinoza was concerned the cash might be counterfeit, according to the affidavits. \u201cBitcoins are neither good nor bad,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cBuying Bitcoins allows money to be anonymously moved around the world with a click of a computer mouse. Improperly used, Bitcoins are often seen as a perfect means of laundering dirty money or for buying and selling illegal goods, such as drugs or stolen credit card information.\u201d Both defendants have been appointed defense counsel, according to court records. They are awaiting bond hearings. Lyda Torres, attorney for Espinoza, didn\u2019t return an e-mail seeking comment. Reid\u2019s attorney couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for comment. U.S. prosecutors in New York said last week that the government had amassed \u201cvoluminous\u201d amounts of evidence against Silk Road\u2019s Ulbricht, including a number of computer servers. Ulbricht, 29, was indicted on four counts -- operating a narcotics trafficking scheme, money laundering conspiracy, computer hacking and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. Charlie Shrem, a prominent proponent of the currency, was charged last month with conspiring to launder more than $1 million in the currency in a case linked to Silk Road. Shrem, 24, is the former vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an industry representative to regulators formed to oversee the currency\u2019s software protocol. He was also chief executive officer of BitInstant, a Bitcoin exchange company. Shrem is free on bail, restricted to his parents\u2019 home. He faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted on the most serious counts. Ulbricht is being held without bail after a federal magistrate said he had allegedly commissioned at least six murders-for-hire in an effort to protect his business. He faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted. The Florida cases are State of Florida v. Espinoza, 14-002923; State of Florida v.

Existing investors Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital are also participating in the second round, which brings the total funding to $31 million, the San Francisco-based company said. Coinbase has about 600,000 users who buy, sell and store the virtual currency online. Venture capitalists have been seeking opportunities to participate in Bitcoin as a payments system. Tim Draper has invested in mobile-payments provider Gliph Inc., and BitPay Inc. has raised capital from Founders Fund and other investors. As more people flock to Bitcoins as an investment and use them to buy goods and services online, users will need virtual wallets, software tools and merchants that will accept the digital money. \u201cAs far as we know we\u2019re the only site touching all three aspects of the Bitcoin world,\u201d Brian Armstrong, a co-founder of Coinbase, said in an interview.

The investment also underscores Silicon Valley\u2019s interest in how Bitcoin can become a cheaper and more secure way of moving money, rather than a currency that\u2019s bought and sold speculatively, Dixon said. \u201cThe degree to which the current payment system is broken -- the public awareness is not as high as it should be,\u201d Dixon said in an interview. The venture firms didn\u2019t disclose their stakes in Coinbase, or the resulting valuation. Coinbase\u2019s user base is growing about 31 percent each month, the company said.

Andreessen Horowitz supports spending \u201ca good chunk of money\u201d for Coinbase to apply for licenses with state regulators, who are still mulling how they will treat Bitcoin businesses, Ehrsam said. Since Bitcoins exist as software, the virtual currency isn\u2019t controlled by any government or central bank. The digital money emerged in 2008, designed by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity remains unknown. Bitcoins are being used to pay for everything from Gummi bears to digital cameras on the Web, with more than 12 million in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks the digital money\u2019s activity. The virtual currency gained credibility last month after law enforcement and securities agencies said in U.S. Senate hearings that Bitcoin could be a legitimate means of exchange. The price of Bitcoins topped $1,000, as speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. The price has since dropped to around $869 on Bitstamp, one of the more active online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars and other currencies. The Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has said that Bitcoin businesses may be considered money transmitters for the purpose of complying with anti-money laundering laws. State agencies typically license such businesses. \u201cIf their decision is that this needs to be a licensed activity, we will be there day one with an application in hand,\u201d Ehrsam said.

The government is still collecting information on Bitcoin, it said today in a written response to questions asked by opposition lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo. Banks have a duty to notify authorities if they suspect that customers have been involved in crime or drug dealing, it said. Last month\u2019s bankruptcy of Mt. Gox Co., an online Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, brought the issue of regulating the virtual currency into focus in Japan. Bitcoin has attracted attention from authorities around the world who are concerned that the anonymity of transactions may attract money launderers. Okubo\u2019s questions centered on the responsibilities of Japanese banks used by Bitcoin exchanges to settle transactions with clients. While Bitcoin isn\u2019t considered a currency in Japan, it could be subject to taxation like goods and services, the government said on March 7 in response to earlier questions from Okubo, who is a member of the Democratic Party of Japan. Mt. Gox was a customer of Mizuho Bank Ltd., a unit of Japan\u2019s third-biggest bank by market value. Tokyo-based Mizuho repeatedly asked Mt. Gox to close its accounts in the months before the exchange\u2019s collapse because it was concerned about an unmanageable volume of money transfers, the Wall Street Journal reported this month.

Gox online exchange, fueled by speculators snapping up the virtual currency as it gains wider acceptance. Bitcoins, which exist as software and aren\u2019t regulated by any country or banking authority, surged to a record $1,073 today, up more than 80-fold from a year earlier. The currency has rallied on growing interest from investors in China and the U.S., while merchants are starting to accept Bitcoins for everything from Gummi bears to tuition fees. The virtual currency gained credibility this month after law enforcement and securities agencies said in U.S. Senate hearings that Bitcoin could be a legitimate means of exchange. The rally had gathered steam last month after regulators shut down the Silk Road Hidden Website, where people could obtain guns, drugs and other illicit goods using Bitcoins. That generated optimism the digital money would become more widely used for legal purposes. \u201cMilestones do tend to provide some validation, even though they are entirely arbitrary,\u201d Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, wrote in an e-mail. \u201c$1,000 for a Bitcoin would draw attention and certainly gives people positive on the currency another reason to laugh at the naysayers.\u201d Bitcoins were trading at $1,003 apiece today on Mt. Gox, one of the exchanges where the digital money can be traded for other currencies. On Bitstamp, the most active dollar-based marketplace among online exchanges, they were at $949.90. Bitcoins were trading at $12 to $13 a year earlier, and have quintupled this month. Introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoins exist as software, which contain the rules governing their supply. New Bitcoins can only be created by solving complex problems embedded in the currency, keeping total growth limited. There are more than 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks activity across various exchanges. Bitcoin is being used to pay for everything from Gummi bears to smartphones on the Internet. The virtual curency can also be traded without being tracked, potentially reducing banking-transaction fees and making it an attractive tender for those seeking to buy and sell via the Web or in stores. When Silk Road was shut down, the virtual currency lost a third of its value within days as holders sold, predicting a crackdown. Instead, the willingness of authorities to stamp out illegitimate use has come to be seen as an endorsement for Bitcoins, making users and investors more comfortable taking risks with digital money. Bitcoin also gained further legitimacy and attention when a subsidiary of Baidu Inc., China\u2019s top search engine, started accepting Bitcoins on Oct. 15.

Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange that halted withdrawals this month, went offline as a document surfaced alleging long-term theft of about $365 million in the digital currency. A document posted online that appeared to be an internal strategy paper said unidentified thieves stole 744,408 Bitcoins from the exchange -- about $365 million at current rates -- and that the theft \u201cwent unnoticed for several years.\u201d \u201cThe reality is that Mt. Gox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company,\u201d according to the document. The document, which outlines plans for leadership changes, re-branding and a possible move to Singapore, was posted online by blogger Ryan Galt. A person briefed on the situation at Mt. Gox, who asked to remain anonymous because the document is private, said he believed it is authentic. Bitcoin fell 5 percent to $517.71 at 4:48 p.m. London time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages exchange prices. That\u2019s down from as high as $1,151 on Dec. 4. Mt. Gox went offline to \u201cprotect the site and our users,\u201d according to a statement on its website. \u201cWe will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly,\u201d it added. A group of Bitcoin-related companies sought to distance themselves from Mt. Gox, and promised to protect customer funds to promote usage of the currency. \u201cThis tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company\u2019s actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry,\u201d San Francisco-based Coinbase said in a joint statement on its website with Kraken, BitStamp, Circle and BTC China, other prominent Bitcoin companies. \u201cAs with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today,\u201d the companies said in the statement. Efforts to reach the www.mtgox.com website earlier today directed users to a blank white page, a day after Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the digital money. At one point today, the site read \u201cput announce for mtgox acq here.\u201d \u201cWe are shocked to learn about Mt. Gox\u2019s alleged insolvency,\u201d the foundation said in an e-mailed statement. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has since gained traction with merchants around the world. The digital money, based on a peer-to-peer software protocol, has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify transactions while preserving users\u2019 anonymity. The Bitcoin Foundation said that, despite the troubles at Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin protocol was functioning normally. In recent days, Mt. Gox had stopped withdrawals, citing an alleged flaw in the protocol. Since at least 2011, enthusiasts have been trading Bitcoins for dollars and other traditional currencies, and in early 2013 Mt. Gox was one of the biggest exchanges. Mt. Gox said this month that it identified a bug that enables people to withdraw the same Bitcoins more than once, leaving it vulnerable to hackers. Prices quoted on the exchange plunged on speculation that account holders wouldn\u2019t be able to get their coins back. The troubles at Mt. Gox are the latest setback for Bitcoin after authorities in Russia, China and Israel sought to restrict the digital money, while the U.S. seeks ways to prevent money-laundering and illicit sales without killing the new technology.

Investors have funded 19 Bitcoin startups in the region, compared with nine in Asia totaling $13.3 million and three in Europe with $5.6 million, according to the report by Boston-based Aite, which surveyed merchants, banks, regulators and Bitcoin companies. Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, is drawing attention from institutional investors after evolving over five years from an intellectual novelty into a global financial network. Pantera Capital Management LP, the investment firm run by Dan Morehead, disclosed in a December regulatory filing that it had formed a $147 million investment fund for Bitcoin. SecondMarket Inc. said yesterday it\u2019s seeking approval for its Bitcoin Investment Trust to trade publicly by year\u2019s end. Many technical issues need to be worked out prior to mass adoption, Aite said. The Bitcoin network needs to process more transactions faster, and to be more transparent so as to allay regulatory concerns, the researcher said. \u201cA lot of kinks need to be worked out before this utopian promise can be realized, however; the nascent Bitcoin ecosystem is truly akin to the wild, Wild West,\u201d Julie Conroy, an analyst at Aite, wrote in the report titled, \u201cBitcoin: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said in a report last week that Bitcoin may have a future as an innovative payments technology instead of gaining wider use as a true alternative currency.

So much so that Bitcoin users and analysts say the IRS guidance announced yesterday complicates people\u2019s ability to use it as a currency. \u201cThis greater clarity creates greater wrinkles,\u201d said Mark Williams, who teaches finance at Boston University. \u201cThis reinforces that strategy of holding it as a commodity, which then undermines its value as a transactional currency.\u201d The IRS, faced with a choice of treating Bitcoins like foreign currency or property, chose property. Exchanging Bitcoins for goods, services or dollars will generate taxable income or losses, depending on what the Bitcoin investor paid. The IRS ruling could reduce the volume of transactions conducted with the virtual currency, said Pamir Gelenbe, a venture partner at Hummingbird Ventures. The firm invests in technology businesses. Purchasing a $2 cup of coffee with Bitcoins bought for $1 would trigger $1 in capital gains for the coffee drinker and $2 of gross income for the coffee shop. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging if you have to think about capital gains before you buy a cup of coffee,\u201d Gelenbe said. Jered Kenna, a San Francisco-based entrepreneur who owns Bitcoins, said in an interview that after hearing about the IRS guidance he needs to \u201ctalk to my accountant.\u201d More seriously, Kenna said the new rules would complicate the smooth functioning of the Bitcoin payment network. \u201cYou\u2019re increasing the cost of accounting to everyone who touches a Bitcoin transaction,\u201d Kenne said. Others involved in Bitcoin downplayed the effects of the decision, saying it provides needed certainty for investors. Also, because Bitcoins are a long-term investment, much like stocks, the IRS ruling didn\u2019t surprise them. The ruling takes effect immediately and covers past and future transactions and tax returns. The IRS said in its notice that it may offer relief from penalties to people who engaged in transactions before yesterday and can show \u201creasonable cause\u201d for underpayments or failure to file. Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, emerged from a 2008 paper written by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin network uses a public ledger to record transactions made under pseudonyms, a technological breakthrough that allows purchases and sales without using a trusted third party, such as Visa Inc. or Western Union Co. Powerful computers that record the transactions and guard against double-spending the same currency generate new Bitcoins, a process referred to as mining. Mining has made some early Bitcoin adopters wealthy in dollar terms. Others bought into the currency in early 2013, before its price rose more than 50-fold to peak at $1,200 in early December. Bitcoin was priced at $581.86 at 8:05 p.m. New York time yesterday, according to the Coindesk Bitcoin Price Index. In March 2013 the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, like the IRS a part of the Treasury Department, acknowledged digital currencies like Bitcoin are fundamentally different than dollars. It said companies exchanging Bitcoins for dollars can be regulated as money transmitters. That triggered a race among states, notably New York and California, to ascertain how or if their laws apply, since states typically license money transmitters. The Bitcoin industry has been frustrated that parts of the U.S. government are regulating the virtual currency in different ways. \u201cYou see guidance from on high with no public input, which is unfortunate,\u201d said Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation. The IRS ruling means Bitcoin investors will be treated like stock investors. They must determine their basis, or cost paid, for the Bitcoins, so they can tell whether a particular transaction results in a gain or a loss. Someone who bought a Bitcoin for $400 and sold it for $500 would have $100 in capital gains. Bitcoins held for more than a year and then sold would face the lower tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains -- a maximum of 23.8 percent. That compares with a 43.4 percent top rate on property sold within a year of purchase and the 39.6 percent top rate that applies to other types of income. For investors with losses, U.S. tax law allows taxpayers to subtract capital losses from any capital gains. Beyond that, they also can subtract as much as $3,000 of capital losses a year from ordinary income. If Bitcoin were treated as a foreign currency, ordinary -- not capital gains -- tax rates would apply. Losses would be easier to deduct against ordinary income, however. As with stocks, Bitcoin dealers will be subject to different rules that won\u2019t allow for capital gains treatment. Bitcoin miners will have to report their earnings as taxable income with a value equal to the worth on the day it was mined. They would use that as their cost basis and then pay gains or record losses when they sell or exchange the Bitcoins. If they mine as part of a business, they\u2019d have to pay payroll taxes as well. The IRS will require information reporting similar to how the tax agency receives notification of stock transactions and payments to independent contractors. It comes less than three months after National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson called on the IRS to issue taxpayer guidance on digital currency transactions. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s responsibility to inform the public about the rules they are required to follow,\u201d Olson, who runs an independent office within IRS, wrote in her annual report to Congress in January. \u201cThe lack of clear answers to basic questions such as when and how taxpayers should report gains and losses on digital currency transactions probably encourages tax avoidance.\u201d Charles Allen, chief executive officer of BitcoinShop Inc., an online marketplace, said he\u2019d like to see the IRS reconsider its decision as virtual currencies develop. \u201cThe implications this decision will have on the Bitcoin ecosystem are far reaching, and will be burdensome for both individual users of Bitcoins, Bitcoin-focused business and for the general adoption of virtual currencies,\u201d he said, adding that Bitcoin users will adapt to the rules.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-26/bitcoin-currency-use-impeded-by-irs-property-treatment', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 26, 4, 0, 30, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Currency Use Impeded by IRS Property Treatment'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin\u2019s rally is accelerating as the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s description of the digital currency as a \u201clegal means of exchange\u201d bolsters the prospect of wider acceptance as an alternative payment system. Bitcoins, which exist as software and aren\u2019t regulated by any country or banking authority, surged to a record $744 on Bitstamp, an active Web-based exchange where they trade for dollars, euros and other currencies, after the remarks at a hearing by the U.S. Senate\u2019s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The gains extended an advance that has seen the price of Bitcoins quadruple in the past two months and climb 45-fold so far this year. Growing interest from investors in China and a limited supply of Bitcoins have also been fueling the increase in price, while last month\u2019s closing of the Silk Road Hidden Website -- where people could obtain drugs, guns and other illicit goods using Bitcoins -- was already spurring speculators to bet Bitcoins would gain more mainstream acceptance. Now, government agencies from the U.S. Secret Service to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network have weighed in to say that the virtual currency that\u2019s designed to be difficult to trace has potential benefits, as well as risks. \u201cThese hearings mean Bitcoin is finally coming into its own; it\u2019s a real thing and it\u2019s not going anywhere and these hearings highlight that,\u201d said Jerry Brito, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is being used to pay for everything from Gummi bears to smartphones on the Internet. There are 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks activity across various exchanges. Bitcoins can potentially reduce banking-transaction fees, making it an attractive tender for those seeking to trade via the Web or in stores. Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware who is chairman of the Senate committee, said today that while \u201cknowledge and expectation gaps are wide,\u201d the government should establish rules to ensure legitimate use. \u201cWe all recognize that virtual currencies, in and of themselves, are not illegal,\u201d Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general at the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, said at the hearing. \u201cWe are nimble enough and aggressive enough to be able to combat the threat. We are up to the challenge.\u201d Speculative trades exceeded transactions for goods and services by 20 to 25 times in the latest quarter, said Vladimir Maslyakov, co-founder of brokerage Exante Ltd., which has set up a Bitcoin investment fund. \u201cThe real economy is not growing as fast as the price,\u201d said Maslyakov, who said his firm now holds about 60,000 Bitcoins and is seeking approval to solicit funds from U.S. investors. \u201cSpeculators are usually much faster.\u201d Justin Hanneman, who does technology support for a Web-hosting company in Austin, Texas, said he has invested more than $9,000 in Bitcoins since April. \u201cI cling to them for dear life,\u201d said the 23-year-old, who plans to hold onto almost all of his 50-plus Bitcoins -- now worth about $30,000 -- for at least a year. The demand for Bitcoins, governed by rules embedded in the software of the virtual currency, is outstripping supply, fueling the price surge. That also makes it difficult for people to use the digital money to buy goods and services, since the value of items priced in Bitcoins is difficult to pin down. Patrick Murck, general counsel for Bitcoin Foundation, said that there remain \u201cconsumer-protection issues\u201d around the use of Bitcoins. \u201cIt\u2019s very much an experimental currency, and should be considered a high-risk environment,\u201d Murck said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite ready for mass consumer adoption today.\u201d There are about 30 transactions per minute, at an average amount of 16 Bitcoins, Francois Velde, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, estimated in a report published earlier this month. \u201cBitcoin seems to be primarily a speculative investment for now,\u201d Velde said in an interview. While demand continues to climb, with trading volumes up more than 400-fold in the past 12 months, supply is increasing at a predictable rate, thanks to the way the virtual money is designed. Those seeking to create new Bitcoins must use powerful computers to solve complex software problems embedded in the currency, which exists as software. \u201cSupply is limited and doesn\u2019t grow extensively, and there\u2019s more demand as there\u2019s more public awareness,\u201d said Axel Merk, president of investment-adviser Merk Investments LLC in Palo Alto, California. Bitcoin\u2019s rally reversed course in early October, when U.S. prosecutors said Ross William Ulbricht, known on Silk Road as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d ran \u201cthe most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet\u201d and shut down the website. Ulbricht denies the charges and will seek bail at a hearing set for Nov. 21, his lawyer, Joshua Dratel, said last week. When Silk Road was shut down, the virtual currency lost a third of its value within days as holders sold, predicting a crackdown. Instead, the willingness of authorities to stamp out illegitimate use has come to be seen as an endorsement for Bitcoins, making users and investors more comfortable taking risks with digital money. \u201cThe Silk Road closure, and the fact they survived that, it means that Bitcoin is maturing,\u201d Merk said. \u201cThe rogue players are being eliminated, and the players that are able to fit into the regulated world are surviving.\u201d Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and former chief executive officer of Brightcove Inc., is seeking to become one of those players. He\u2019s now CEO of Circle Internet Financial Ltd., a startup that\u2019s creating tools and services for individuals and businesses to use Bitcoins. \u201cSilk Road was perceived as a very significant milestone,\u201d said Allaire. \u201cWe all know there\u2019s been dramatic growth in the amount of Chinese consumer interest.\u201d Bitcoin also gained further legitimacy and attention when a subsidiary of Baidu Inc., China\u2019s top search engine, started accepting Bitcoins on Oct. 15. Chinese Bitcoin activity has exploded, with the number of yuan-based trades jumping 30-fold in the past two months and making BTC China the top online-exchange by volume. After Baidu\u2019s decision and a documentary on Chinese television on Bitcoins earlier this year, interest in the virtual currency in China took off. BTC China surpassed Mt.Gox and Bitstamp earlier this month as the top market for exchanging Bitcoins with other currencies. While BTC China\u2019s average daily trading volume was about 1,100 Bitcoins during the month of January, transactions have been at about 90,000 per day so far in November, according to Bitcoincharts. \u201cI am very, very bullish on the price of Bitcoin,\u201d Bobby Lee, BTC China\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve become the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange. We have the most liquidity. We\u2019ll bring stability to the market in terms of price eventually. Until then, there\u2019s going to be frenzied buying.\u201d U.S investors, including wealthy families, are allocating more of their investments into Bitcoins in order to diversify portfolios, according to Barry Silbert, CEO of SecondMarket Inc., which connects investors with private company shares. \u201cWe are now seeing the principals of Wall Street firms and funds investing their own funds into Bitcoin,\u201d said Silbert, who said he\u2019s working with Pensco Trust Co., Entrust Group Inc. and Equity Trust Co. to offer investors the ability to buy Bitcoins for individual retirement accounts. SecondMarket\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust has already attracted $15 million, more than the $10 million he projected for 2013, Silbert said. Underscoring how speculative Bitcoin trading is dominating the market for the virtual currency, online-retailer BitcoinShop.US said it\u2019s experiencing declining orders. Since products on the Web store are priced in Bitcoins, shoppers are hesitant to shop for jewelry, computers and other goods on the website. The number of orders plummeted 20 percent last week, according to Michal Handerhan, co-founder of BitcoinShop. \u201cFor the last five days, it\u2019s been really slow, and it\u2019s because the rate\u2019s gone up so fast, people are holding the Bitcoins back,\u201d Handerhan said in an interview. \u201cWhen the rate goes up really rapidly, it\u2019s against us.\u201d In order for Bitcoins to retain their value while gaining broader acceptance and use, the virtual currency has to become stable, fluctuating no more than 25 percent a year, said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group in New York. That may not happen for at least another year, he said. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s good volatility, but it impedes the growth in the Bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d Colas said in an interview. \u201cBitcoin volatility right now is insane.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-19/bitcoin-gaining-validity-fuels-rally-in-virtual-currency-tech', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 19, 5, 1, 0, 13000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Gaining Validity Fuels Rally in Virtual Currency: Tech'}, {'articleText': u'   JPMorgan Chase & Co. has no plans to introduce a competing product to Bitcoin, the digital money created as an alternative to currencies controlled by nations and banks, according to a person familiar with the matter.

That\u2019s why executives at the biggest payment firms -- watching Bitcoin developments closely -- show little worry, saying their technology is safer, more reliable and easier for consumers. \u201cProtection and trust are crucial to us and our card members and merchants,\u201d Dan Schulman, president for enterprise growth at American Express and former CEO of Priceline.com Inc., said in an interview at the lender\u2019s New York headquarters. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that is offered by crypto-currencies today.\u201d Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, has no central issuing authority and uses a public ledger to verify transactions that are authenticated by cryptographic signatures. Daily Bitcoin transaction volume climbed to more than $58 million on Feb. 20 from about $6.9 million a year earlier, according to data from Blockchain.info, which provides online wallets for digital currencies. That\u2019s about as much as Visa and MasterCard process every four minutes, not including the $3.7 trillion in cash disbursements they handled last year. Authorities in Russia, China and Israel have sought to restrict Bitcoin, while the U.S. seeks ways to prevent money-laundering and illicit sales without killing the digital currency. The threat of regulation and disruptions, including hacker attacks on online exchanges, have caused Bitcoin\u2019s value to plummet. The virtual currency has dropped about 30 percent in the past month to about $605 on Feb. 22, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages exchange prices. Closing values from Feb. 1 through Feb. 22 have ranged between $552.21 and $853.02, data available yesterday show. Supporters of Bitcoin such as Peter Vessenes, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, say it\u2019s cheaper than traditional payment systems because users can move funds without middlemen such as networks, merchant acquirers and banks taking a cut. The proponents predict entrepreneurs will solve security issues while keeping costs low. For example, a cluster of startups are devoted to securing Bitcoins or insuring them. \u201cThey are ways to construct a risk-free money flow,\u201d Vessenes, whose organization promotes the currency\u2019s use, said in an interview. Retailers such as Salt Lake City-based Overstock.com have said they\u2019re drawn to Bitcoin because it costs less to accept than bank-issued debit cards, which can carry fees and fraud costs amounting to about 3 percent of purchases. Bitcoin payment processor BitPay handled transactions for 23,000 merchants last month, up from 2,400 a year earlier, and is adding about 1,000 a week, said Jan Jahosky, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based company. While card-network executives are watching how businesses and governments react to Bitcoin, it\u2019s the same level of attention they give to any development in the payments industry, a person with direct knowledge of one network\u2019s view said. There\u2019s no Bitcoin-specific lobbying effort, even though the topic does come up in talks with lawmakers and regulators, said another person with knowledge of a major network\u2019s strategy, asking not to be named because the talks are private. It\u2019s too early to understand all the implications, Visa CEO Charlie Scharf told analysts on a Jan. 30 conference call, in which he called Bitcoin \u201cfar more complex\u201d than it\u2019s often portrayed. \u201cPeople talk about things like frictionless and things like that, and when you actually dig through it, it\u2019s really not the case,\u201d said Scharf, 48. \u201cWe feel very comfortable with the business that we have here.\u201d While firms such as Visa and MasterCard haven\u2019t labeled Bitcoin a risk in disclosures, PayPal owner EBay Inc. called Coinbase and BitPay, which both act as Bitcoin merchant acquirers, competitors in a Jan. 31 filing. Acquirers help businesses set up systems to receive their customers\u2019 money electronically. There\u2019s nothing \u201cholding PayPal back from pursuing digital payments,\u201d EBay CEO John Donahoe, 53, said in a Feb. 18 interview with Bloomberg Television. More retailers will begin accepting Bitcoin this year, said Barry Silbert, an investor in BitPay and San Francisco-based Coinbase. The companies \u201care in various stages of discussion with the who\u2019s-who of retailers,\u201d said Silbert, the CEO of SecondMarket Inc., a New York-based brokerage. A spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association declined to comment, and Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation, said she was \u201cnot familiar with this being on the horizon for any major retailers.\u201d A growing number of regulators are resisting virtual currencies. The instruments suffer from volatility, can be exploited for money-laundering, fraud and terror financing, and are vulnerable to robbery via hacking, Israel\u2019s central bank and financial regulators said last week. In the U.S., Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York Department of Financial Services, said the state will propose rules for licensing digital-currency companies this year, and may adopt tougher money-laundering rules than those applying to banks. \u201cYou can already see there are some issues about it -- just on some very basic things,\u201d said Martina Hund-Mejean, chief financial officer of Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, in a phone interview Jan. 31. \u201cWhen you talk about virtual currencies you especially compare it to what we do in our network, and the safety and the security around it is paramount.\u201d New rules also may undermine Bitcoin\u2019s ability to compete, according to payments-industry executives. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how it escapes regulation by governments around the world,\u201d said Discover\u2019s Nelms, 53, in a Jan. 23 interview. His company, based in Riverwoods, Illinois, had $310 billion in network volume last year. AmEx handled $952 billion in worldwide spending. Bitcoin \u201cwill eventually be made as a payment system, I think, to follow the same standards as the other payment systems, and that will probably be the end,\u201d Jamie Dimon, 57 and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank, said in a Jan. 23 interview with CNBC. Retailers are accepting Bitcoin to lure new customers and are plowing money saved on Bitcoin transactions into incentives. Gyft, a seller of gift cards, uses most of the 3 percent it saves from accepting the digital currency on customer rebates. International merchants such as Fiverr, an online market for freelance services like writing and graphic design based in Tel Aviv, say accepting Bitcoin provides access to U.S. consumers. Bitcoin has \u201csteady penetration in the U.S., which is a key territory for Fiverr,\u201d CEO Micha Kaufman said Feb. 12 in an e-mail. The adult website Porn.com accepts Bitcoin so users don\u2019t have to reveal their identities. Marijuana dispensaries in U.S. states that have legalized the drug may accept it to avoid dealing in cash, which can be stolen, or credit cards, which require cooperation from financial firms, according to Silbert. Still, Bitcoin price swings may deter shoppers. In a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, economist David Yermack said that Bitcoin shifts too much to be a unit of account or a store of value. \u201cIt\u2019s a volatile currency, and that makes it very difficult for consumers and merchants to know the value of what they have when using Bitcoin to purchase or receive goods or services,\u201d said AmEx\u2019s Schulman, 56. Alex Hoffmann, executive vice president of global product management and emerging channels at MoneyGram International Inc., said he doesn\u2019t see widespread demand to send digital currencies. He isn\u2019t convinced that Bitcoin has developed into a disruptive technology for the payments industry. \u201cToday, people speculate on the potential,\u201d Hoffmann said in an interview. \u201cBut today you do not have it.\u201d Ken Murphy, a payments analyst at Standard Life Investments Ltd. in Boston, said Bitcoin probably won\u2019t work out in the long run. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of hype,\u201d Murphy, who oversees about $300 billion in assets including shares of Foster City, California-based Visa, said in an interview. \u201cHumans are slow to adapt.\u201d As Bitcoin evolves, its opportunities and potential risks to the U.S. payments industry will become clearer, according to Zachary Aron, a principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP who specializes in payments. \u201cAnyone in the payments space has seen and viewed disruption for a very long time,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBitcoin does have potential and promise, but we are still in its infant stages.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-24/bitcoin-seen-by-payment-networks-as-little-threat-to-dominance', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 24, 18, 52, 24, 409000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Seen as Little Threat to Payment Firms'}, {'articleText': u'  Ross William Ulbricht, accused of operating the billion-dollar online Silk Road website where customers used Bitcoins to buy and sell drugs, faces a new charge of running an ongoing criminal enterprise. Ulbricht, 29, allegedly known as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury in New York, formalizing the charges made by U.S. prosecutors in an Oct. 2 criminal complaint. The new allegation in the indictment carries a maximum life prison sentence and a mandatory minimum term of 20 years, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. Ulbricht was also indicted on conspiracy to commit computer hacking and conspiracy to launder money, both of which he was previously charged with. In the indictment, the government extended the timeframe of the narcotics conspiracy by one month, saying it went from January 2011 to October 2013. He was arrested in October and charged with running \u201cevery aspect\u201d of Silk Road, where anonymous users paid Bitcoin digital currency to purchase drugs, malicious software for computer hackers and other illegal products, Bharara said. Ulbricht is being held at the federal jail in Brooklyn, New York, after prosecutors said he tried to arrange the murder of six people to protect his business. In December the U.S. charged three former employees with aiding the operation. \u201cSilk Road emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet, serving as a sprawling black-market bazaar where unlawful goods and services, including illegal drugs of virtually all varieties, were bought and sold,\u201d Bharara said in a statement. Illegal drugs were openly advertised on the site under categories such as cannabis, ecstasy, opioids, prescription drugs and stimulants, Bharara said yesterday. Law enforcement agents made more than 100 undercover purchases of heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and LSD, according to Bharara. Ulbricht tried to make those transactions anonymous first by using \u201cThe Onion Router\u201d or \u201cTor\u201d network, a special network of computers around the world designed to conceal the IP address and identity of the network\u2019s users, prosecutors said. Ulbricht designed Silk Road to include a Bitcoin-based payment system to conceal the identities and locations of the users, according to the indictment. Joshua Dratel, Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer, didn\u2019t immediately return a voice-mail message yesterday seeking comment on the indictment. The U.S. seized about 173,991 Bitcoins worth more than $150 million during the investigation, Bharara said. That included about 29,655 that were recovered from servers used to run the Silk Road site, he said. Another 144,336 Bitcoins were recovered by the U.S. from computer hardware belonging to Ulbricht after his arrest. On Jan. 15, the Bitcoins recovered from Silk Road servers were ordered forfeited in a civil action filed by the U.S. which seeks all of Silk Road\u2019s assets. Ulbricht has filed a claim asserting ownership of the Bitcoins and contesting their forfeiture. The narcotics conspiracy charge carries a maximum life sentence and a mandatory 10-year prison term. The money laundering conspiracy carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison. The criminal case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 14-cr-00068; the civil forfeiture case is U.S. v.

The warning comes ahead of what\u2019s been labeled as a March 25 \u201cairdrop\u201d of Auroracoins. The makers of the currency intend to give each Icelander 31.8 AUR units, \u201cdesigned to break the shackles of the fiat currency financial system in Iceland,\u201d according to an e-mail sent to journalists last month by Baldur Friggjar Odinsson, a name composed of old Norse deities. The e-mail directed attention to the website, auroracoin.org. The prospect of free virtual money comes as authorities across the globe are grappling with how to treat Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency. Since its 2008 creation, Bitcoin has challenged regulators and legislators, who are struggling to keep up as people use the software to pay for everything from university tuition to cups of coffee. Iceland imposed capital controls on its own currency, the krona, in 2008 after its three largest banks collapsed, sending the nation into its worst recession in six decades. The island has since struggled to lift the controls, which have trapped about $7.2 billion in assets. \u201cThis one-time event will create the conditions for Icelanders to start using the currency, by providing them with a start and making them aware of the currency and its possibilities,\u201d according to Auroracoins statement. \u201cAfter the Airdrop, the only way to acquire Auroracoins will be through mining and transacting.\u201d The krona gained 0.3 percent to 156.93 per euro as of 3:26 p.m. in Reykjavik.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-20/cryptocurrency-airdrop-sparks-iceland-virtual-currency-warning', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 20, 15, 32, 32, 498000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Cryptocurrency \u2018Airdrop\u2019 Sparks Risk Warning for Icelanders'}, {'articleText': u'  A Florida man can be charged with money laundering in a case involving the use of Bitcoins, a judge ruled, rejecting a defense claim that he did nothing illegal because the online currency isn\u2019t money. Pascal Reid, 29, was charged Feb. 6 with money laundering and engaging in an unlicensed money-servicing business in what one prosecutor said may be the first state charges over the use of Bitcoin. A second man, Michell Abner Espinoza, 30, also was charged, but his case is before a different judge. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Fleur Lobree said today the state has grounds to proceed with the case against Reid. His lawyer argued that because Bitcoin isn\u2019t a currency under Florida law, his client didn\u2019t commit a crime when he allegedly sold Bitcoins to an undercover agent who said he was using them to buy stolen credit cards. Bitcoins have no central issuing authority and use a public ledger and a network of voluntary computers, known as \u201cminers,\u201d to verify encrypted transactions. It has gained traction with merchants selling legitimate products. It also has been used to facilitate illegal transactions, which has drawn the attention of law enforcement worldwide. Lobree didn\u2019t rule on whether Bitcoins are currency under state law. Instead, she said she was persuaded by the prosecutor\u2019s argument that a transaction involving Bitcoins can constitute money laundering if another currency is also used. \u201cThis would be the equivalent of trade-based money laundering,\u201d Assistant State Attorney Tom Haggerty told the judge. \u201cLet\u2019s say the defendant used the proceeds of drug sales to buy televisions and ship them to Colombia to sell them there and get money out of them.\u201d Florida\u2019s money laundering law defines monetary instruments as \u201ccoin or currency of the United States or of any other country, travelers\u2019 checks, personal checks, bank checks, money orders, investment securities in bearer form or otherwise in such form that title thereto passes upon delivery, and negotiable instruments in bearer form or otherwise in such form that title thereto passes upon delivery.\u201d Reid\u2019s attorney, Ron Lowy, said after the hearing that the state\u2019s decision not to argue that Bitcoin is a currency forces prosecutors to prove his client believed the officer\u2019s claims that he was using the Bitcoin to buy stolen credit cards. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the state has decided to rely on the officer\u2019s cash and not the Bitcoin as constituting currency for purposes of the money laundering statute,\u201d Lowy said. \u201cThe point of money laundering is to turn what you have into clean cash, not turn clean cash into Bitcoin.\u201d Federal prosecutors are probing possible criminal violations tied to the shutdown last month of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest exchange for digital-currency transactions, two people familiar with the matter said Feb. 26. It follows a series of charges filed by U.S. prosecutors since last year related to the currency. The Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office also requested information from the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group, and companies that have done business with Mt. Gox, said a person briefed on the foundation\u2019s contacts with prosecutors. The foundation and the companies aren\u2019t targets, the person said. Japanese authorities are also probing Mt. Gox\u2019s shutdown. Both defendants in the Florida case are being held in Miami-Dade County jails. Reid\u2019s trial is scheduled for May 27. A prosecutor said the cases may be the first time anyone has been prosecuted for Bitcoin activity under a state statute. \u201cThe use of Bitcoins in the transactions is a new technological flourish to this very old crime,\u201d Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said after the men were arrested. The \u201carrests may be the first state prosecutions involving the use of Bitcoins in money laundering operations,\u201d she said. In the Miami case, undercover police officers sought out \u201cindividuals engaged in high volume Bitcoin activity,\u201d Rundle said after the two men were arrested. In December and January, a Miami Beach police officer and a Secret Service agent bought $1,500 in Bitcoins from Espinoza and another $1,500 from Reid in separate transactions, according to arrest affidavits filed in the case. They told both men they were using the digital currency to buy stolen credit cards. The officers found the men on the Bitcoin exchange site LocalBitcoins, according to the filings. In February, Reid sold the Secret Service agent $25,000 worth of Bitcoins, paying him a $5,000 commission, police said. The Miami Beach officer tried to purchase $30,000 in Bitcoins from Espinoza, but Espinoza backed out of the deal, fearing the cash might be counterfeit, according to the affidavits.

Speculators, known as miners, use powerful computers to solve complex software problems and verify transactions to unlock new bitcoins. They\u2019re finding that the enterprise isn\u2019t as profitable as it once was. Drawn by the virtual currency\u2019s jump in value last year, digital prospectors have turned the mining industry into an arms race as they buy expensive computing equipment and gobble up electricity. While that worked well as long as bitcoin\u2019s value kept rising, smaller players are now being crowded out by bigger competition, high utility bills and declining prices. \u201cIf you mine at the moment, you have to be very lucky to get anything,\u201d said Mehmet Vatansever, who bought $16,000 worth of mining computers in February to chase after new bitcoins. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult business.\u201d Mining, a nod to the excavation of minerals and metal ore, is entirely digital and part of bitcoin\u2019s design, so that the money self-regulates supply and prevents out-of-control inflation. The mining process gets increasingly complicated as more bitcoins are created, driving demand for computing power. Bitcoins, which jumped to more than $1,200 last year from $12, were trading at about $420 apiece yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, an average of prices across major global exchanges. China\u2019s tighter controls on alternative currencies, the implosion of the Mt.Gox exchange and a U.S. Internal Revenue Service ruling that bitcoins should be taxed as a property have all weighed on the virtual currency. While he has been able to create new bitcoins, Vatansever soon discovered that his equipment was on track to earn less than his monthly utility bill of $480. After selling his computers on EBay Inc. in April, Vatansever estimates that he lost a total of about $6,000 on his mining adventure. In the past week, miners made $14.9 million in revenue, compared with a weekly average of $25.2 million in December, according to Blockchain.info, a bitcoin-data aggregator. The figures represent the number of bitcoins mined plus transaction fees, multiplied by the dollar-based market price. EBay now features more than 1,600 listings for mining computers, many of them used. \u201cThe mining market has evolved from being mostly isolated ventures to more organized entrepreneurial ventures that are still racing to get an edge with increasingly fast equipment and lower electricity costs,\u201d Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., said in an interview. \u201cAt this point, the opportunity for individual miners is very small.\u201d While individuals give up prospecting, at least two other larger mining companies, KnCMiner and Cloud Hashing, are still generating profits. By scaling up operations, they\u2019ve been able to save costs on cooling and power, making their computers more efficient and cost-effective. KnCMiner also sells mining computers to other miners. KnCMiner, based in Stockholm, operates about 7,000 machines. While the mining company\u2019s electric bill in March came to $450,000, the computers mined 21,000 bitcoins, according to co-founder Sam Cole. Cloud Hashing, which lets people buy computing capacity in its data center and share in profits, mines about $230,000 to $260,000 worth of bitcoins a day, according to Chief Executive Officer Emmanuel Abiodun. \u201cWe are profitable whether we sell contracts or not -- through mining,\u201d Abiodun said in an interview. \u201cOur business model can handle volatility in pricing.\u201d Mining-equipment suppliers are feeling the cool-down firsthand. CoinTerra Inc., a manufacturer of the powerful computers used to crunch numbers for new bitcoins, has seen new sales shrink by 30 percent in the past three weeks from the preceding period, according to CEO Ravi Iyengar. Mining-equipment suppliers are also detecting early signs of a shift to new virtual currencies. Approximately 250 KnCMiner customers switched their orders from $10,000 computers to similarly priced alternative-currency mining machines in the past three weeks, according to Cole. Because they are newer, designed differently and currently mined by fewer people, currencies such as Litecoin can be more profitable, according to CoinWarz, which tracks mining activity. \u201cThe new rush right now is Litecoin,\u201d Colin Lusk, a network engineer in Portland, Oregon, said in an interview. While he once mined only bitcoins, Lusk now uses five of his eight machines to produce Litecoins and other virtual currencies. Created in 2011, Litecoin is similar in design to bitcoin yet requires less computing power. A $3,500 computer can produce $25 worth of Litecoins a day for $3 in electricity, while producing $20 worth of bitcoins would cost $17, Lusk said. Andrew Korb, another miner, said buying bitcoins outright is easier than participating in the mining arms race. While Korb and fellow investors have spent 900 bitcoins on mining equipment since last year, they have only generated 77 units of the virtual currency, he said. \u201cPeople do the math,\u201d said CoinTerra\u2019s Iyengar. \u201cIf the price goes down significantly, people realize they may be better off buying bitcoins directly from an exchange rather than buying machines.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-11/bitcoin-mining-boom-sputters-as-prospectors-see-real-cash-losses', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 4, 12, 4, 1, 0, 4000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Mining Boom Sputters as Prospectors Face Losses'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin, the virtual money former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called \u201ca bubble,\u201d was accepted as payment in the purchase of a Tesla Motors Inc. Model S electric car at a California Lamborghini dealership. Lamborghini Newport Beach sold the car for about $103,000, or 91.4 Bitcoins, in a transaction handled by payment processor BitPay, said Cedric Davy, marketing director for the Costa Mesa, California-based dealership. The sale cleared yesterday and the Model S will be delivered to its Florida-based buyer, who asked not to be identified, Davy said by telephone. \u201cWe\u2019re a dealership -- we\u2019re not in the business of doing any speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, it was just important that the money could be transferred into U.S. dollars.\u201d While Bitcoin has been embraced by some as a way to pay for goods using smartphone applications, the money has had a harder time winning acceptance from governments and banks. This week China\u2019s central bank barred financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions. Baidu Inc., the owner of that nation\u2019s largest Internet search engine, yesterday halted acceptance of payments using Bitcoins for its website-acceleration service.

Bitcoin \u201chas to have intrinsic value,\u201d Greenspan said Dec. 4 in a Bloomberg TV interview. \u201cYou have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven\u2019t been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.\u201d The dealership doesn\u2019t know if it is one of the first and possibly only dealerships to sell a car in exchange for Bitcoins, Davy said. Charles Cyrill, a spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association, which represents almost 16,000 new-car dealers, said he couldn\u2019t immediately comment. Davy said he\u2019s heard from \u201ca couple\u201d other dealers who were interested in how the Model S transaction worked after Lamborghini Newport Beach posted about it on its blog. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s hit the car world as much as it hit probably the finance or the tech world,\u201d he said of interest in Bitcoin. Blogs including MotorAuthority and Zero Hedge and the Orange County Business Journal reported on the Model S transaction earlier this week. The dealership has taken about 10 phone calls from potential customers interested in buying cars with Bitcoins, and it\u2019s open to doing more such sales, Davy said. The Model S buyer had been turned down by other dealers who didn\u2019t want to accept Bitcoins, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about Bitcoins before, but I was not very familiar with what it is,\u201d Davy said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a little abstract to me, to be honest.\u201d Bitcoin has received other endorsements, including from analysts at Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch unit. Bitcoins should have a maximum market value of about $1,300, assuming they become a major e-commerce instrument and a significant \u201cstore of value\u201d that\u2019s similar to silver, David Woo, a foreign exchange strategist, and other analysts at Merrill Lynch wrote in a report Dec. 5. The People\u2019s Bank of China also said this week that the public is free to participate in Internet transactions provided they take on risk themselves.

His task, he said, was just to find out what Congress could do to help law enforcement as they tried to confront the novel\xa0challenges posed by the anonymous virtual currency. A bit more surprising was the answer he got from representatives from the law enforcement agencies who testified. No one disputed that virtual currencies are great for facilitating illegal behavior, like buying child porn, drugs, and weapons, or paying to get people killed. But everyone had pretty much the same answer for him: \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general for the criminal division of the U.S. Department of Justice, said the department is doing just fine, using existing money laundering statutes to prosecute EGold and Liberty Reserve, virtual currencies it busted for money laundering offenses in the last five years. Likewise, criminal statutes on the books seem to be sufficient to prosecute the man recently arrested for allegedly running Silk Road, the online black market. \u201cAs our track record shows, we are up to the challenge, and we are innovating as the criminals are innovating,\u201d she said at the hearing. \u201cI do think we have the statutory tools that we need, for the most part.\u201d The Department of Justice seems to feel entitled to beat its chest about its technical savvy. The Liberty Reserve case is the largest money laundering case it has ever brought, and the Silk Road bust left it holding $70 million worth of Bitcoins. Ed Lowery, the special agent in charge of the criminal division of the Secret Service, said he doesn\u2019t even think Bitcoin is the virtual currency of choice for the international criminal networks that his agency considers its primary adversary in the cybercrime world. The decentralized and uncontrollable nature of Bitcoin apparently makes the gangs of Eastern Europe as queasy as it does U.S. officials. While virtual currencies have\xa0 indeed been used by criminals, Lowery said, the most effective way to combat them is to try to help toughen the spines of countries whose lax regulations allow criminals to operate with impunity. Following suit, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said worries about Bitcoin, but she didn\u2019t offer\xa0 a lot of advice about how helpful but baffled lawmakers such as Carper could pitch in.\xa0It turns out that not every problem has a high-tech answer. \u201cCash is still probably the best medium for laundering money,\u201d she said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-19/currency-cops-want-congress-to-steer-clear-of-bitcoin-thanks', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 19, 10, 48, 0, 475000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Currency Cops Want Congress to Steer Clear of Bitcoin, Thanks'}, {'articleText': u' A look at how this week\u2019s cover got made.

Many stories about Bitcoin, which is mined by computers and circulates without a central bank, contain sinister or science-fiction elements that make it hard to tell if the currency is for real or just an overblown gimmick. On Thursday evening, GigaOM hosted a meetup in San Jose where six Bitcoin authorities, including investors and engineers, shared their views on how the currency is evolving and who is using it. Here are three of the larger ideas to emerge from the discussion (if you want to catch up on the basics of Bitcoin, see \u201cYes, you should care about Bitcoin and here\u2019s why\u201d): Bitcoin can help ordinary people\n      Wences Casares, a venture capitalist and chief executive officer of Lemon Wallet, grew up in Argentina, where he experienced firsthand what happens when a government mismanages its currency: inflation, capital controls, and the destruction of family savings. Today, the same thing is happening all over again as desperate Argentines try to convert their pesos into a store of value that the government can\u2019t seize or destroy. One option is Bitcoin. Casares explained how some people in his country are using \u201cold Android phones\u201d to acquire and exchange Bitcoins at a time when the government is clamping down on the trade in U.S. dollars. More remarkable, Casares noted, is that many of the people using Bitcoin don\u2019t know much about technology\u2014but they do know, through hard experience, about currencies and can recognize alternate sources of money. Other speakers and audience members also described the potential of cyber currencies like Bitcoin to ameliorate the broken or compromised banking infrastructure in places like Latin America and Asia. In the larger picture, Bitcoin could be just one part of an impending revolution in the world\u2019s money transfer networks. Specifically, new currencies and transfer platforms may provide a way for people, including those who rely on remittances, to escape the high transfer fees imposed by credit-card and wire companies\u2014and simply exchange money directly with one another around the world at almost no cost. Bitcoin is complicated\u2014and is going to stay that way for a while\n      Mike Hearn is a young engineer from Google who uses his 20 percent time to work on developing Bitcoin software. At the meetup, he chatted about infrastructure and security with Bennett Hoffman, a former Microsoft employee who is building a new Bitcoin exchange called Buttercoin. The two engineers agreed that the system that creates Bitcoins is secure and stable, even if parts of the surrounding ecosystem (exchanges, wallets, and so on) are not. Hearn said Bitcoin is not ready for \u201cyour grandma\u201d just yet\u2014and that is, in part, a choice by those who are building and fine-tuning the Bitcoin open-source code bequeathed by the currency\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Hearn\u2019s point is that he and others are focused now on improving the processing and ledger system that facilitates Bitcoin transactions; they are ensuring it can scale in the same way that the Visa payment network is able to handle sales spikes. This focus on \u201cthe guts\u201d of Bitcoin means that, for now, the software will remain complicated and will be a challenge to those who aspire to build consumer-facing interfaces on top of it. This won\u2019t, however, prevent Bitcoin from gaining traction in the real world. David Barrett, CEO of Expensify, explained earlier in the evening that his firm now allows companies to reimburse their employees\u2019 expense reports in Bitcoin. According to Barrett, the Bitcoin option is not a gimmick but rather a cheap and practical solution for companies to pay employees across borders. Bitcoin will be regulated\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing\n      Bitcoin watchers gasped this weekend when the Department of Homeland Security executed a seizure warrant against the owner of Mt. Gox, the Japanese exchange where many people trade the currency. The law enforcement action, which comes after U.S. securities regulators said they are looking at Bitcoin, posed a new liquidity threat to the currency and also reinforced its outlaw reputation. Surprisingly, the Bitcoin backers at the event appeared to welcome the government\u2019s growing involvement. According to Micky Malka of Ribbit Capital, which is investing in Bitcoin ventures, regulation is not just inevitable\u2014but desirable. \u201cI\u2019m already regulated by eight central banks,\u201d said Malka, explaining that regulation is simply part of any mature financial system and that, in the case of Bitcoin, it is likely to introduce a new level of stability. Malka and others, including the Bitcoin Foundation, said they are less interested in libertarian fantasies than they are in establishing a rational and informed regulatory structure around the currency. Malka added that his biggest fear for Bitcoin is not the U.S. government but shenanigans by speculators. The San Jose event felt at times like a cross between an investor seminar and a church revival, with the packed room sometimes applauding wildly at the blue skies of Bitcoin. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not something very real going on here\u2014a lot of very smart and credible people are putting a lot of time and money on the line in an effort to redefine the world\u2019s financial infrastructure. According to Casares, the moment feels like 1992, when the world was on the cusp of discovering the World Wide Web but hadn\u2019t yet found the right user interface. He might be right. \nAlso from GigaOM:\n How Retailers Can Outdo Showrooming With In-Store Wi-Fi (subscription required) \nGrubHub, Seamless Merge, Creating One Giant Online Delivery Service\n \nArmed With Android App Support, Jolla\u2019s \u20ac399 Phone Launches by Year-End\n \nMarissa Mayer: Some Tumblr Users \u2018May Never Come to Yahoo,\u2019 and That\u2019s OK\n \nUnderwater Batteries Are Making a Splash for Energy Storage\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-20/the-future-of-bitcoin-three-predictions-from-experts', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 5, 20, 16, 28, 58, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'The Future of Bitcoin: Three Predictions From Experts'}, {'articleText': u' Just as the price of Bitcoin crashes to earth from its effervescent highs, two of the world\u2019s most famous cybercurrency investors, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, are hoping to escape the planet\u2019s pearly grip. The Winklevii, as they are commonly known, used the website of their investment firm to announce that they have signed up to travel to suborbital space on Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company founded by Richard Branson. Tickets cost $250,000, according to Virgin Galactic, which plans to start flying next year. The brothers plan to pay for their trip in Bitcoin, it almost goes without saying. The Winklevoss announcement, full of soaring language best read aloud in the voice of Morgan Freeman narrating a NOVA special, attempts to lay out the brothers\u2019 rationale for the journey. They are not going because it is meant to be a wild, memorable ride available only to the wealthy elite. Rather, the journey represents \u201cthe reduction of pain-points and friction in an effort to build a better world.\u201d The post continues: \u201cHumans have a long tradition of exploring and forging new frontiers, both physically and metaphorically. In the Middle Ages, Marco Polo\u2019s writings\u2014which recounted his 24 years of travel and trade on the Silk Road\u2014built a new and lasting level of economic and cultural awareness between Europe and Asia. 200 years later, they would inspire 15th century explorer Christopher Columbus to search for a shorter route to the Far East by sea. While Columbus did not achieve his original goal, he did manage to bring word of a new landmass back to Europe, which planted the seeds of hope and possibility in the minds of persecuted Pilgrims, who fled to and settled North America 100 years later. Such stories of inadvertent and iterated accomplishment are all too familiar in the spheres of exploration and innovation. They demonstrate how the building blocks of human discovery are not necessarily brilliance and perfection, but rather, the courage to fail and persistence to keep on trying.\u201d The post, written by Tyler Winklevoss, says the brothers are considering their tickets as support of \u201ca new technology that may forever change the way we travel, purchased with a new technology that may forever change the way we transact.\u201d The brothers came into fame and fortune by suing Harvard classmate Mark Zuckerberg over the origin of Facebook.

The Audi S3 Sportback now comes with an option for an embedded Sierra Wireless LTE module as part of its technology package, making it the first production car to come with fully integrated 4G connectivity. U.S. customers will get an LTE option on the A3 Sedan, as well, but they\u2019ll have to wait until next spring. A three-door plug-in hybrid version of the S3 Sportback is also scheduled for U.S. release in 2015. Audi spokesman Brad Stertz tells GigaOM that now that its first 4G car is in production, the German carmaker will roll out the feature to the rest of the fleet quickly, including its entire A3 line in Europe starting in November. What\u2019s particularly interesting is how signing up for in-vehicle 4G connected car service will be different in the U.S. and Europe, mimicking the way those different regions buy phone service. In Europe, 4G Audi owners can use any carrier\u2019s network. They just need to insert a data SIM card into the dash. In the U.S., though, Audi connectivity will most likely be tied to a specific operator, Stertz says, just like most of our smartphones are optimized for specific carriers. That makes some sense, given the complexity of U.S. LTE networks. While in Europe most carriers are deploying their networks on three common bands, in the U.S. every operator is using a different LTE frequency. Just as Apple and Samsung Electronics make separate versions of the iPhone and Galaxy for different carriers, Audi and Sierra Wireless may need to supply different modules for those different networks. Stertz says Audi is still negotiating with U.S. operators and will make an announcement about which carrier or carriers it will partner with at a later date. Even though Audi won\u2019t have its first U.S. 4G car until next year, it will likely beat all its rivals to market. General Motors plans to make AT&T LTE standard in all cars starting in model year 2015. BMW has developed an LTE hotspot accessory car owners can use to create miniature wireless LAN within the vehicle, but the automaker hasn\u2019t started selling it yet. The accessory approach also means it\u2019s not integrated with the car\u2019s infotainment system, so you can connect your gadgets in the car but not the car itself. Audi is going fully integrated from the get-go. The S3 and forthcoming A3 will use their LTE chips to link its on-board nav system to the cloud with access to Google Earth and Streetview. Drivers can access social media networks Facebook and Twitter with voice commands, though its Audi Connect platform is still light on other apps. And the LTE connection can also be redistributed to other devices in the car through Wi-Fi. How you\u2019ll wind up paying for the service is still an open question. Many people will balk at the thought of buying a separate mobile plan for their cars. That\u2019s why I suspect we\u2019ll see carriers include connected cars in their data share plans. You wind up paying a $5 to $10 monthly device fee to maintain your car\u2019s mobile connection and then draw from the same data bucket shared by your smartphone and tablet. \nAlso from GigaOM:\n Apple Should Offer a Cheap iPhone but It Isn\u2019t Doomed if It Doesn\u2019t (subscription required) \nFWIW, The Ubuntu Edge Has Become a Crowdfunding Record-Breaker\n \nThe Bitcoin Machine Is Now Available for Pre-Order\n \nWhat Happens to Your Macbook Air Battery in a Year\n \nLeaked NSA Audit Reveals Thousands of \u2018Unintentional\u2019 Surveillance Incidents in the U.S.\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-16/whats-keeping-the-4g-car-out-of-the-u-dot-s', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 8, 16, 17, 40, 1, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"What's Keeping the 4G Car out of the U.S."}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2015-12-14/banks-need-to-disclose-more-about-cybercrime-efforts', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' Shortly after the alert sounded at 9:10 p.m., Yahoo Japan\u2019s risk team knew it had a problem. Some 20 million user names and passwords were being dumped into a file that could then be stolen. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d the team asked the employee whose account was copying the encrypted data, recalls risk manager Motonobu Koh. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything,\u201d the worker replied. \u201cI\u2019m at home.\u201d The responders managed to block the download.  The April 2, 2013, breach of Yahoo Japan, controlled by SoftBank, was an attempt to grab the identities of visitors to Japan\u2019s most-trafficked website. It remains one of the biggest attacks on the data of the Japanese public. Other targets in the past few years included Sony, defense contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and once-preeminent Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  In the coming months, Japan\u2019s government is expected to pass a law designed to beef up the country\u2019s surprisingly slack cybersecurity. Only about half of Japanese companies have an IT security policy, according to the National Information Security Center (NISC), a government agency. \u201cThe biggest problem, and the biggest ally of cyber attackers aiming at Japan, is the widespread belief that it can\u2019t happen here,\u201d says William Saito, an information technology strategy adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s cabinet. Companies in Japan are among the world\u2019s most vulnerable, and hacking attacks on state entities have more than doubled since 2010 to one every 30 seconds, according to data from Japan\u2019s government and the Ponemon Institute, a U.S.-based security researcher. Attacks in Japan surpassed 1 million in 2012. Among those hit: the government trade negotiations team, the lower house of Parliament, and a nuclear power research institute. Part of the problem, NISC said in a report last year, is that the country has a shortage of 80,000 information security engineers, and that most of the ones in place lack the skills to counter online threats. The proposed law would name NISC the cabinet\u2019s primary cybersecurity coordinator and require companies to report all incidents regardless of bad publicity. The legislation was spurred in part by the need to prepare for Tokyo\u2019s 2020 Summer Olympic Games, says Takuya Hirai, a lawmaker with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party who drafted the bill. It passed the lower house and is awaiting a vote in the upper house. While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint where the growing attacks against Japan are coming from, security companies agree that most of the servers used by hackers are in China and that viruses are often written using Chinese-language operating systems. Although groups from more than one country appear to be involved and the hackers may just be using the servers, the attacks are on the same scale as those that prompted the U.S. to accuse China of state-backed industrial espionage, says Itsuro Nishimoto, chief technology officer at LAC, a Japanese cybersecurity consultant. (The Chinese government has denied the U.S. accusations.) At Yahoo Japan, Koh says he has a good idea where his adversaries are from but declines to say. His experience helps illustrate the challenges that NISC and Japan\u2019s companies will face. A month after the April 2013 breach, just as his team had finished its investigation and had patched flaws in its network, the attackers returned, exploiting a different system weakness. They also changed tack, copying smaller batches of data. Koh\u2019s unit again blocked the attack, but not before the intruders made off with information belonging to 1.5 million customers. Last October the same intruders attacked for a third time but were repelled, says Koh. All three attacks used malware designed specifically for Yahoo Japan\u2019s computers; the company\u2019s name was written into the code. \u201cAt this point there are only two types of companies in Japan: the ones that have been attacked, and the ones that just don\u2019t know it yet,\u201d says Saito, the government adviser. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in that.

Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that once led the world in trading the digital currency. By the end of 2013, with the Bitcoin price booming, the value of Carlson\u2019s holdings had surpassed $1 million. Their value now: zero, most likely. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in myself for not getting off the exchange when I saw the problems,\u201d says Carlson, a Seattle-based entrepreneur who says he feared withdrawing his holdings would further destabilize the company. \u201cThis is Bitcoin, after all. It\u2019s the Wild West.\u201d Mt. Gox ceased operations on Feb. 24, taking roughly $400 million of its customers\u2019 digital currency down with it. The collapse has cast a shadow over Bitcoin, whose proponents have channeled a revolutionary fervor into startups built around mining and facilitating transactions with the currency. The question now is whether the Mt. Goxalypse marks an end to Bitcoin or a new phase of its evolution toward stability and widespread acceptance. \u201cI think some people will lose faith,\u201d says Naval Ravikant, a Silicon Valley investor active in the Bitcoin community. \u201cThere will probably be a lot of people who stampeded in who now stampede out.\u201d Within hours of Mt. Gox going offline, the Bitcoin price dropped to about $430, from more than $1,000 late last year. It recovered somewhat by the following evening. When it made its debut in 2009, Mt. Gox wasn\u2019t a venue for financial innovation. It was founded by Internet entrepreneur Jed McCaleb as a marketplace for the illustrated trading cards used to play Magic: The Gathering. (Mt. Gox is an acronym for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange.) McCaleb remade the site as a Bitcoin exchange soon after but, wary of the impending regulatory challenges, sold it to Mark Karpeles, a Frenchman living in Tokyo. The transaction was completed online. By early 2013, Mt. Gox\u2019s servers handled 70 percent of all Bitcoin buying and selling, and its challenges grew, too. Last year the U.S. government seized two Mt. Gox bank accounts with more than $5 million in combined assets and charged the company with transmitting funds without a proper license. Companies working with Mt. Gox sued for breach of contract; customers complained in online forums that they couldn\u2019t make withdrawals. Karpeles, once a regular participant on forums under the handle MagicalTux, began to post less and less. He couldn\u2019t be reached for this article.   On Mt. Gox\u2019s final day, blogger Ryan Selkis obtained and published a document that purported to outline the company\u2019s internal crisis strategy. The real problem, the document suggested, was security: Some 744,000 Bitcoins had been stolen from the exchange. Soon after Selkis posted, Mt. Gox pulled down its website and Twitter account. Definitive answers about exactly what happened likely won\u2019t emerge until the inevitable lawsuits. \u201cIt\u2019s either total incompetence or negligence or outright criminal behavior,\u201d says Jeremy Allaire, founder of Circle Internet Financial, a Bitcoin services startup.  Some Bitcoin believers say Mt. Gox\u2019s demise will ultimately help their cause. They\u2019re hailing it as the end of amateur hour for the currency, as many did after the fall of Silk Road, a Bitcoin-based black market notorious for drug trafficking. (Silk Road\u2019s collapse in October only briefly tanked the currency\u2019s value.) \u201cIt purges the final vestige of the first generation of infrastructure companies,\u201d says Jerry Brito, director of the technology policy program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a longtime Bitcoin supporter. \u201cWho\u2019s left? It\u2019s the serious people, who are doing this right.\u201d Several prominent Bitcoin companies issued a joint statement saying \u201cthere are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out\u201d and vowing to shore up the currency\u2019s credibility by requiring better behavior from companies that handle Bitcoins for customers. \n\n      Shortly before the Mt. Gox collapse on Feb. 24, SecondMarket founder Barry Silbert, whose online exchange specializes in trading alternative investments such as equity stakes in private companies, announced the formation of a U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange that will admit only regulated financial institutions. The exchange, a spinoff of SecondMarket, has an initial investment of $20 million in U.S. dollars and Bitcoins. (He wouldn\u2019t say how much of each.) Silbert says he\u2019s in talks with interested financial institutions and a handful of reputable Bitcoin companies, and the downfall of Mt. Gox hasn\u2019t threatened those discussions. \u201cIt just highlights the need for a well-run, well-capitalized exchange here in the U.S.,\u201d he says. Bitcoin\u2019s most significant vulnerability isn\u2019t its underlying technology. The success of any currency requires belief in its value, and the Mt. Gox debacle is a big setback for Bitcoin as it struggles to achieve greater stability. Chris Larsen, CEO of digital currency startup Ripple Labs, is less bullish on the fallout from the Mt. Gox PR nightmare.

PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel sunk seven figures into a super-PAC that supported the 2012 presidential bid of Paul\'s father, Ron. In visits to tech companies, Paul has explained why the open-minded folks who become technologists should reject the leviathan grip of government. Last summer, Paul was the star of the conservative Lincoln Labs "2014: Reboot" conference, where he mused about how the crypto-currency Bitcoin could break up the money monopoly. It could lead to "Wal-Mart Coin, K-Mart Coin," of companies building their own currencies, tied to stocks. "Because I\u2019m sort of a believer in currency having value," Paul said in a separate interview, "if you\u2019re going to create a currency, have it backed up by\u2014you know, Hayek used to talk about a basket of commodities? You could have a basket of stocks, and have some exchangeability, because it\u2019s hard for people like me who are a bit tangible. But you could have an average of stocks. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the next permutation." Today, at another Lincoln Labs event\u2014this one quartered at the Chamber of Commerce offices in Washington, and titled "Reboot Congress," TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington asked Paul to expand on his view of Bitcoin. \u201cI\'m sort of an outlier on the Bitcoin thing.\u201d "You\'ve said it was \'pretty cool,\'" said Arrington. "That was my scientific analysis," said Paul. "My only question there is, post-apocalypse, are you gonna be a gold guy or a Bitcoin guy?" asked Arrington. "I\'m sort of an outlier on the Bitcoin thing," said Paul. "I\'ve been fascinated by the concept of it, but I never would have purchased it myself. I\'m just a little bit skeptical. I remember reading an article by Marc Andreessen\u2014obviously, I respect him, he\'s a smart guy, and he\'s made more money than I have. He wrote about Bitcoin, and the thing that fascinated me about what he wrote was that, if you imagine something like Wal-Mart, that\'s got a 4 percent profit margin, and they\'re laying 2 or 3 points to Mastercards, that there are ways to eliminate the credit card company through Bitcoin." Paul was referring to a few arguments that Andreessen, whose Bitcoin views verge on utopian, had been making since 2013. "This is just me," said Paul. "I have a biology degree. With Bitcoin my concern always was whether or not something has real value. I could imagine a kind of coin that was exchangeable. This gets back to the whole idea of whether money has to be exchangeable for something to have value. What if Bitcoin or Wal-Coin was exchangeable for Wal-Mart stock? What if Wal-Mart, K-Mart, Kroger and maybe 20 retailers got together and issued a coin to deal against a basket of stocks? I think that might be something I\'d be interested in investigating. If they do it with a goal of\u2014I hope Visa and Mastercard are not listening\u2014eliminating the credit card companies from the equation\u2014what if Wal-Mart\'s doubling their profits from 4 percent to something like 8 percent?"', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-12/rand-paul-could-big-companies-grow-their-profits-by-creating-their-own-currencies-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 12, 18, 36, 6, 827000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Rand Paul: What If Companies Could Create\xa0Their Own Currencies?'}, {'articleText': u" A cybercriminal group going by the name \u201cDD4BC\u201d is blackmailing financial institutions, threatening to take down their customer websites unless they pay a hefty bitcoin ransom. DD4BC \u2013 which stands for \u201cDDoS for Bitcoin\u201d (Distributed Denial of Service for Bitcoin) \u2013 has been targeting firms\xa0since mid-2014, so far evading international police forces.\xa0 The group initially hit bitcoin mining companies, exchanges and online casinos with a handful of attacks per month. But over the last few months it has\xa0ramped up activity and turned its attention to the financial sector \xa0\u2013 banks, brokerages and automated clearing houses in Europe, Australia and the U.S. To date, the group has carried out almost 150 attacks, 58 percent of which have been directed at financial service companies, according to research by Akamai published on Wednesday. The U.K. National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT UK), which runs a national cyber-threat data-sharing initiative, confirms a \u201cmarked increase\u201d in reports of DDoS attacks by DD4BC against its\xa0partners\xa0\u2013 which include Lloyd\u2019s Bank and BAE Systems, though there is no suggestion they\xa0have been hit. As\xa0cyber-attacks go, DDoS is a blunt instrument. It involves\xa0hammering a target website with traffic using a distributed network of computers under the control of one attacker. The aim is to flood the site with traffic to the point that its web server crashes and the site goes offline. There is a commercial impact \u2013 estimated by Neustar to cost up to $100,000 per hour\xa0\u2013 but these attacks predominantly damage\xa0brand perception.\xa0\u201cIt represents vulnerability,\u201d says Cisco\u2019s Adam Philpott, who heads up cybersecurity in Europe. \u201cIf I can't access the service of an organization that\u2019s handling a significant amount of my money, how can I trust it?\u201d DDoS extortion is not new, but DD4BC is particularly prolific.\xa0 \u201cThey\u2019ve been industrializing their operation \u2013 doing it at a scale and level that has not been seen before,\u201d adds James Chappell, co-founder of security firm Digital Shadows. The group is going for second- and third-tier financial organisations \u2013 ones that have money but not necessarily the defences or technical acumen to deal with a DDoS assault. Attacks work like this: DD4BC starts a small \u201cdemonstrative\u201d attack that lasts less than an hour, to show its\xa0capabilities. Then it emails the organisation with links to media coverage about previous attacks to show legitimacy. Within the email are the group\u2019s demands \u2013 anywhere from 25 bitcoin ($6,150) to 100 bitcoin ($25,000) \u2013 along with a deadline. \u201cThey do their homework, make themselves well-heard and they follow up their threats,\u201d says Morten Kjaersgaard, chief executive of Copenhagen-based Heimdal Security. \u201cIf the organization doesn\u2019t pay \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t - they'll be hit with another DDoS attack with a larger volume and the price will go up. If they [DD4BC] perceive that the organization is taking defensive measures, the extortion payment will increase further,\u201d adds Roland Dobbins, from Arbor Networks\u2019 security engineering and response team. According to Dobbins and Kjaersgaard, DD4BC shows a medium level of technical competence, savvy enough to understand bitcoin and to switch between a range of\xa0DDoS techniques to\xa0find a website\u2019s Achilles heel. However, the perpetrator is using off-the-shelf DDoS attack services \u2013 hired out nominally to stress test websites\xa0\u2013 instead of writing its own code. By going after such a heavily regulated and valuable industry as banking, DD4BC has attracted the attention of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The UK\u2019s National Crime Agency wouldn\u2019t comment on DD4BC specifically, but told Bloomberg that it was \u201caware of\u201d the group\u2019s\xa0methods. In the U.S., the\xa0Financial Industry Regulatory Authority warns that\xa0several members have been affected, and urges victims to contact the FBI. The advice from security specialists is never to pay such a ransom \u2013 it will show your company to be a soft target and damage its reputation. That hasn\u2019t stopped a number of businesses, including bitcoin gambling company Nitrogen Sports and at least one unnamed bank, from doing so, say researchers.\xa0Nitrogen Sports told BitcoinGamblingGuide\xa0it paid up to buy time and put additional protections in place. The good news? Extra server capacity and defense systems can help a target survive a DDoS attack. The bad?\xa0While DD4BC is high profile, it\u2019s just one of many cyber-threats faced by financial institutions, such as banking trojans, many of which are more damaging, if less high-profile. In the meantime, one company has taken matters into its own hand by placing\xa0a bounty of\xa0100 bitcoin (around $25,000)\xa0on DD4BC\u2019s digital head. Bitalo was contacted last year and refused to play ball. \u201cWe decided to post the bounty to raise awareness and try and get some insider information,\u201d says CEO Martin Albert.

European government bonds jumped as the Fed delay fuels speculation that the European Central Bank\xa0could step up its stimulus program. Expectations for further easing from Bank of Japan\xa0policy makers, who are not meeting again until two days after the Fed's October meeting, were not enough to stop the yen rising in overnight trade. U.S. two-year Treasuries\xa0staged their biggest one-day rally since 2009 following the Fed announcement, and that rally continues\xa0this morning with the yield on the two-year note falling to 0.67 percent according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. New home prices in China rose in 35 of the 70 cities monitored by the government, up from 31 in July. The recovery, helped by five interest rate cuts since November and an easing of home-purchase restrictions, saw a recovery in property developer stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, where the main index closed 0.4 percent higher in thin trading. There's an election in Greece this weekend, and the result really is too close to call. With such uncertainty, it might come as a surprise to see Greek 10-year government bond yields hit a 2015 low\xa0in trading this morning.

The forty-something Greek prides himself on being the first to bring bitcoin, a digital currency, to his cash-strapped country a year ago. "I didn\'t see it as much as a business case back then," says Marinos. "The main reason was to bring awareness about bitcoin and blockchain technology to Greece." Demand has never been stronger, he says, up by 500 percent in four weeks. When starting from zero though, even 500 percent doesn\'t go far. Greece is a country of more than 10 million and an average age of 43.5. A quick and un-scientific survey of 10 people on the street showed just two people had heard of bitcoin. That hasn\'t deterred others from joining in. A bookshop in a northwestern suburb of Athens is home to the country\'s only bitcoin ATM. One man is stocking up. His name is Felix Weis, a computer programmer who\'s taken a year off to travel the world with one caveat: he can only use bitcoin, and cash as a last resort. "I have to," Felix says, because "I cut up my credit card.\xa0In Greece I\'m offering people 30 percent extra to try and convince them to start accepting bitcoins because I really believe in it." Felix is 27 and from Luxembourg. He dropped out of a Computer Science and Economics program in Germany after just one year. "I\'ve been programming since I was young. I wasn\'t really learning anything new. From the economics side I didn\'t think the fundamentals were right," he says. "But not for everything." He has an opinion about should happen in Greece too. "It\'s hard to compete in the euro zone. After all you look at Romania. Compared to what you see in Athens they\'re doing better, even though the minimum wage is lower." All this is explained in a taxi ride to one of the only establishments in Greece accepting bitcoin, a family-owned Greek restaurant. After insisting on splitting the fare, there\'s no alternative but to open an account and accept the \xa33.43. The restaurant is closed but it\'s not a problem for Felix. The bitcoin community is small and he knows Nikos Houtas, the owner\'s son, who breaks out the ouzo and salad. It\'s all paid for without a coin or card in sight. Four or five customers in the past two years have paid using bitcoin, according to Houtas. If it\'s going to be a viable alternative many more are going to have to cash in soon.

Allaire\u2019s startup, Circle Internet Financial, has pulled in $26\xa0million in venture capital over the past two years with the promise that it would help \u201cmake Bitcoin mainstream\u201d by developing simple tools for using it. Visit Circle\u2019s website today, and references to Bitcoin aren\u2019t prominent. Allaire\u2019s current sales pitch is that his company can move your money\u2014be it in dollars, euros, or yen\u2014quickly, securely, and for free. \u201cWe\u2019ve never said we\u2019ve attached ourselves for eternity to Bitcoin,\u201d Allaire says. \u201cUsers around the world understand monetary value in their local currency.\u201d As interest in Bitcoin as a new currency wanes, Allaire\u2019s shift points the way to a potentially different legacy. Conceived as a substitute for conventional currency, without the involvement of established institutions, Bitcoin is poised to evolve into a money transfer system that would do what Western Union or Citigroup does, only more cheaply and efficiently. In the early days of 2014, partisans of the digital currency looked forward to what they hoped would be the year of Bitcoin. They spoke of it going mainstream as a replacement for \u201cgovernment-issued\u201d currencies or as an inflation-proof store of value. Coinbase in San Francisco\u2014\u201cWe make it easy to get started with Bitcoin\u201d\u2014joined with Budweiser to distribute small amounts of Bitcoin at summer concerts (people got drunk). BitPay, an Atlanta-based startup that processes Bitcoin payments, sponsored the Bitcoin St.\xa0Petersburg Bowl on Dec.\xa026 (North Carolina State beat the University of Central Florida, 34 to 27). Anyone who saw holding the currency as a path to riches has been disappointed. The value of Bitcoin\u2014measured in dollars\u2014fell almost 70\xa0percent last year and has continued to plunge in 2015. The price drop, together with the collapse of a major Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, undermined the idea that Bitcoin\u2014beyond the reach of government regulators\u2014is a safe\xa0haven. And despite the marketing efforts, the use of Bitcoin for ordinary purchases has stagnated. Just because customers can use it to pay Dish Network for TV service, Expedia for hotel rooms, and Dell for PCs doesn\u2019t mean they do or that they will, says Jeffrey Robinson, a money-laundering expert who wrote a book titled BitCon. Transactions didn\u2019t rise above 55,000 a day during 2014, according to Blockchain.info, which compiles Bitcoin data. \u201cIf you measure Bitcoin as a transactional currency, the buying of goods and services, Bitcoin is a non-event,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cA complete non-event.\u201d \u201cThe payment industry should be at least an order of magnitude smaller than it is today.\u201d\u2014Chris Dixon Yet even Robinson praises the technology underlying Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto, the name used by Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous creator, called it \u201cthe blockchain.\u201d It\u2019s the public ledger on which every transaction, whether it\u2019s for 1,000\xa0Bitcoins or one-one-thousandth of one, has been recorded since the currency appeared in 2009. Bitcoin \u201cminers\u201d use powerful computer technology to maintain the ledger, confirming that the same Bitcoin isn\u2019t spent twice and recording transactions. They get freshly issued Bitcoins as a reward. The miners perform the same function as a bank or wire transfer service\u2014acting as a trusted intermediary. The difference is that with Bitcoin, the transfers are generally free. Despite global integration of financial markets, moving cash is expensive and often slow. Merchants pay about $48\xa0billion in fees to banks for debit card usage annually, while immigrants sending money home pay about $37\xa0billion in fees each year to companies such as Western Union. International wire transfers can take four or five days and are costly enough to make small payments\xa0pointless. Circle, Allaire\u2019s company, is using the blockchain technology to build a Bitcoin-based transfer system. It would allow American parents, for example, to deposit dollars in an account where they would be converted to Bitcoins and sent to a daughter studying in South Korea, who would change them into won, all at no charge to the parents or daughter. Costs would be low because Circle avoids the banks and payment processors that services such as Apple Pay and Venmo rely on. Circle won\u2019t say how it plans to profit from the business. Coinbase and BitPay have similar ambitions for Bitcoin-based payment systems. Banks and payment companies make money by charging a fee for something that \u201cmostly involves moving bits around the Internet,\u201d wrote Chris Dixon, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, in a December 2013 blog post. \u201cThe payment industry should be at least an order of magnitude smaller than it is today.\u201d Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, wrote that he sees Bitcoin as \u201ca new software protocol through which you could rebuild the payments industry in ways that are better and cheaper.\u201d (Bloomberg LP, which owns Bloomberg Businessweek, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz.) Allaire contends that if sending money were cheaper, it would become much more common. He compares money transfer to text messaging, unknown 20\xa0years ago, now ubiquitous. Develop the infrastructure, he says, and sending cash among friends and family and for businesses small and large will become common. Circle is seeking licenses, hiring experts to ensure compliance with regulations, and talking with regulators. So the future of Bitcoin may rest with entrepreneurs seeking to build straightforward, regulated companies that do a straightforward thing that is now more expensive than it needs to be: moving money. That might not be up there with creating a global currency, but it would be no small accomplishment.

The two former agents, Carl Force of the Drug Enforcement Administration and Shaun Bridges of the Secret Service, stand accused of stealing $1 million in illicit funds stemming from their roles in the investigation of Silk Road and its shadowy organizer known as "Dread Pirate Roberts." Lawyers for Ross Ulbricht, the man convicted in February of running the online black market, immediately seized on the development as further proof that he should be entitled to a new trial. The list of charges against Force, in particular, depict an undercover DEA investigator with an entrepreneurial bent who was determined to harvest as much personal wealth as he could from his connections to both the U.S. government and the criminal underground. According to the complaint, Force used several different online accounts to offer inside information about the case. Sometimes this was part of the official investigation into Silk Road, with Force reporting that Bitcoins were never actually delivered even though it seems they had been. But the undercover agent also set up aliases that he never revealed to fellow law enforcement officials. At one point he reached out to Dread Pirate Roberts under the name \u201cFrench Maid\u201d and accepted $100,000 in Bitcoin in exchange for revealing the name that law enforcement agents had been given as Dread Pirate Roberts\'s identity. But it seems French Maid simply stole the money. Logs found on Ulbricht\u2019s computer say that French Maid disappeared after accepting payment. When Force found out the identity of a suspect in the case, the complaint alleges that he attempted to use it to blackmail Dread Pirate Roberts. The agent revealed the name of the supposed mastermind behind Silk Road, threatening to share the information with law enforcement. The name\u2014which wasn\u2019t Ulbricht\u2019s\u2014apparently didn\'t prompt the desired response from Dread Pirate Roberts, who didn\u2019t respond to the blackmail attempts. Then there was the case of Curtis Green, a Silk Road employee who was arrested in January 2013 and agreed to cooperate with law enforcement. Green turned over his login credentials for an account with the username \u201cFlush,\u201d according to the complaint. Force changed the password for the account, which within days was used to steal $350,000 worth of\xa0Bitcoin from Silk Road. Dread Pirate Roberts accused Flush of stealing the money nine days after Green\u2019s arrest, then hired another Silk Road user named Nob to kill the person behind the Flush account. Of course, Force also controlled the Nob account, meaning he was essentially accepting payment to assassinate himself. He did so in a staged killing, in exchange for $80,000 from Dread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht\u2019s attorneys were told about the investigation last November but couldn\'t use it in his defense. Joshua Dratel, who leads Ulbricht\u2019s defense team, said in a statement that the Force case was a \u201cmonumental scandal,"\xa0adding: \u201cIt is clear from this complaint that fundamentally the government\u2019s investigation of Mr. Ulbricht lacked any integrity, and was wholly and fatally compromised from the inside.\u201d The fact that allegedly corrupt officers had access to accounts with the power to change aspects of the Silk Road site also raises questions. During the trial, for instance, Dratel argued that while Ulbricht controlled the Dread Pirate Roberts account at times, he wasn\u2019t always in control. Presumably this access could have been used to tinker with the fluid identities of the users on a website where identities were always fluid. Dratel had already called for a new trial for Ulbricht and plans to appeal the conviction. Ulbricht\u2019s mother, in an interview, argued that precluding the use of this evidence was devastating to her son\'s defense. \u201cI think this violation is an even bigger issue, with wider ramifications, than the alleged illegal activity of the agents,\u201d said\xa0Lyn Ulbricht. \u201cOur right to a fair trial is fundamental to our freedom.\u201d Prosecutors maintain that the allegations against Force don\u2019t help Ulbricht\u2019s case. \u201cTo the contrary, the suspected leaks of investigative information by SA Force indicate that Ulbricht repeatedly paid a government agent to provide \u2018counter-intelligence\u2019 information in the interest of protecting Silk Road from law enforcement,\u201d they wrote in a letter to the court in November that was recently unsealed. "Likewise, regardless of whether SA Force or someone else stole $350,000 through the \u2018Flush\' account in January 2013, the facts remain that Ulbricht believed that his employee, Curtis Green, had stolen the funds, and that Ublricht sought to murder Green for doing so.\u201d Both the prosecutors in the Ulbricht case and the complaint against Force note that the investigation in Baltimore was carried out independently of the ones that led to Ulbricht\u2019s trial in New York earlier this year. During the trial, Dratel tried to draw attention to the conflicts between various law enforcement agencies involved in investigating Silk Road. In addition to the New York case, there\u2019s the question of what will happen with a separate case in federal court in Maryland. Ulbricht stands accused in that case of attempting to murder Green. But Force and Bridges were directly involved in that investigation. There has been no action on the case in months, and Ulbricht\u2019s backers have publicly questioned why it has stalled.

In 2007 and 2008, I interviewed more than a happy few economists and strategists who kept saying it was going to be fine. Just before I took a long and poorly timed vacation in September of 2008, I wrote a blog post\n quoting three distinguished experts who thought stocks had hit bottom. "When people make predictions about this stock market," I wrote, "I don\'t know whether to congratulate them for their boldness or question their sanity." Now I know.  That crisis actually benefited me, in a way. I held on to my job and diligently saved more in my 401(k) plan. Today I feel flush after the S&P 500\'s 150 percent rise since the market bottom in March 2009.  And that means I have more to lose.  I IM\'d my friend Mark, a finance nerd. Me: Hey curious what you think: are you worried about default? Me: cause I\'m terrified Mark: um Mark: I just wish I had more cash on hand to invest in case it does.  This was reassuring, kind of. Maybe there would be an upside to any chaos.  Mark: The U.S. will lose its dominance with or without a default.  Mark: Gold & bitcoins are probably the only other assets to compete [with Treasuries] Should I have more cash around to take advantage of market panic? Was the financial system so precarious that Bitcoins\n, the investment du jour of drug smugglers and money launderers, could make a comeback? Should I be building a bunker in my basement and stocking it with the vegetarian equivalent of Spam? Is there a vegetarian equivalent of Spam? Throw in a few gold bars? Actually pay attention to libertarians? I would call Milo. That\'s what I would do. I would call Milo. In previous crises, when I needed a quote from a voice of reason, I often reached out to Milo Benningfield of Benningfield Financial Advisors in San Francisco. Now, on the phone, he sounded relaxed.  He admitted to feeling a bit of gut-tightening after reading the same articles that I had. "It was kind of like watching a trailer for a summer blockbuster," conjuring up economic horrors like worldwide depression in place of exploding cities and Zombie apocalypse, he said. But he wasn\u2019t freaking out. Like most blockbuster movies, the media coverage is over the top, "sensationalized," he said. As a reporter I couldn\'t escape from the news, unlike clients of his whom he advises to just turn off the TV. It was true. I was at Bloomberg with 11 TV monitors in my line of sight. Wall Street was right in betting that the U.S. wouldn\'t stop paying interest on its bonds, Benningfield said. I said my worry wasn\'t just default, but the unexpected consequences of even getting close. In corporate America, that would be called reputational risk. What happens if the government pays creditors but not Social Security recipients?  Benningfield has long experience calming clients who disagree with him. He didn\'t think my fear was irrational, he said diplomatically. "Markets are not necessarily great at pricing the risk of highly improbable events." Great. He tried to turn the conversation to something more productive -- not what the future holds but what my actual options were. I could sell my stocks. If I did, what would I do with the money? Ironically, the safest place to be in times of economic stress is usually U.S. government bonds, he said. Yes, that was ironic. When actual clients call up Benningfield in a panic, his first question is whether they have the means, and the stomach, to weather a volatile market. If you have money in stocks that you need in just a few years, you shouldn\'t have those assets in stocks anyway, he says. That doesn\'t apply to me, he observed. With my stocks in a retirement plan I can\'t touch without penalties for decades, I can take plenty of short-term losses in exchange for long-term gains. My stress is the price long-term investors must pay.  "This is part of the plan," he said. "If the risk goes away, so do the the returns." Then he told me a story about a surfer. I was watching 11 TVs at the moment and didn\'t entirely follow, but it seemed a veteran surfer was out off the California coast having a great day, the sun was out, the waves were perfect, all was well and he was bitten by a shark. I stopped watching 11 TVs. The surfer survived to tell the tale, Benningfield added quickly, drawing this lesson: Some dangers we can see coming. Many we can\'t. I could exit the market now, only to jump back in when everything looked safe and then "get blindsided." The biggest profits often come to investors when the sharks are circling.  After hanging up with Benningfield, I pulled out my "Stock Trader\'s Almanac" and confirmed his contention that the market\'s worst days are often followed by its very best days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average\'s worst days of 1929 were Oct. 28 and 29, while its best was Oct. 30. Miss out on the losses and you\'ll probably miss out on the gains. Benningfield is good at his job. I left my investments alone. But I felt just as anxious as before. More, really. And now I was thinking about sharks and one-legged surfers.  On the next day of the shutdown, the 10th, House Republican leaders floated the idea of lifting the debt limit temporarily. For six weeks. Now it\'s day 11. Will the deal fall apart, on all 11 TV screens? Even if it\'s approved, what happens in six weeks? Does this mean the government stays shuttered for even longer, damaging the economy in another unpredictable way? I don\'t know. I do know I\'m not doing anything stupid in the heat of the moment.

When investors think of Peru, mountains enter the picture, too. Their vision holds no mystery, though -- they're seeing mountains of metals. Peru's mining industry is huge. While the country ranks 47th in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), falling between Algeria and Kazakhstan, it ranks fifth in the production of gold, and third in silver and copper. Last year, the companies in the Lima General Index that mine metals helped drag it down 25 percent; this year, they've helped it gain 10 percent. Investors who want exposure to Peru through exchange-traded funds -- or any other kind of fund -- have few options. Actually, they have just one option. It's the the $250 million iShares MSCI All Peru Capped ETF (EPU\n). Like the Lima General Index, it's up 10 percent in 2014; mining companies account for 6.2 percent of that gain. EPU tracks 25 stocks, half of which are in the materials sector. It charges 0.61 percent of assets annually, about average for a single-country emerging markets ETF. On top of its metals mojo, Peru has decent economic fundamentals. The inflation rate is 2 percent, the growth in its gross domestic product is 5 percent, and its debt represents just 18 percent of its GDP. Investors will be hard-pressed to find a Peru stake in their emerging markets funds. For example, the country gets a 0.3 percent weighting in the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM\n) and a 0.05 percent weighting in Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS\n). EPU is volatile, but not much more than the broad emerging markets indices. And it's much less correlated to movements in the U.S. than the big emerging markets funds. While you take a concentrated risk when you invest in any single-country ETF, EPU can help diversify a portfolio.

In other words, there are nearly as many ETFs in registration as there are in existence. The good news for investors who shudder at the thought of yet more ETFs to sort through: only some of these will become reality. The bulk of these filings are plain-vanilla \u2018me-too\u2019 products. Others, such as the Guggenheim Small-Mid Cap BRIC ETF, offer a slight variation on products currently on the market. Then there are a few that stand out like peacocks in a flock of crows. Here are some of the more intriguing ETFs awaiting SEC approval, along with ticker suggestions from yours truly. 1. Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF The Winklevoss Twins propose to create an ETF that tracks the bitcoin, the crypto-currency, the same way that the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD\n) tracks gold. There has never been a more highly publicized ETF launch. The reason for the buzz are the three forces of nature coming together: the bitcoin, the ETF and the Winklevoss Twins.  Unfortunately for the Winklevii, most of those articles panned the filing, citing the dozens of risks outlined in 18 pages of the prospectus, such as possibility of government regulation, security concerns and the twin's lack of experience managing a trust. Ticker possibilities: WINK, COIN, WTF 2. IndexIQ Physical Diamond Trust  This ETF would store diamonds in a small vault in Antwerp, Belgium, similar to the way gold is stored in a very large vault in London for GLD. There\u2019s nothing like this fund on the market. The closest thing out there is the PureFunds Diamond/Gemstone ETF (GEMS\n), which tracks companies involved in the diamond business.  The biggest question here: How to value diamonds and make a net asset value investors can believe in? If the ETF can answer that question and establish a logical system, it could be attractive to commodity investors looking for an alternative to gold.  Ticker possibilities: ROCK, IDO 3. LocalShares Nashville ETF Taylor Swift may be one potential investor in this \u2018Music City ETF,\u2019 which will track publicly traded companies that have corporate headquarters in the Nashville area, such as Dollar General (DG\n) and Cracker Barrel (CBRL\n). While this would be the first ETF ever to focus on a specific city, there were two state-focused ETFs back in 2009 that ended up closing up shop. The Texas Large Companies ETF (TXF) and the Oklahoma ETF (OOK) both opened and closed within a year for failing to attract assets.  Ticker possibilities: NASH, YALL 4. iShares Human Rights Index Fund This ETF would start with the MSCI All Country World Index and then exclude countries associated with \u201cwidespread death, torture, rape, forced labor and forced displacement from communities.\u201d While the name is catchy there are logical questions as to how this will benefit investors if a few stocks from Sudan or Iran are excluded from an index of 9,000 equities.  No socially responsible ETF has hit the big time yet. The most successful one thus far is the iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI\n), which aims to invest in U.S. companies with positive environmental, social and governance characteristics. It has attracted $220 million in assets in seven years. However, iShares has the resources and marketing muscle to give this one the best fighting chance. That is, if it ever launches. Ticker possibilities: HMAN, CARE 5. ProShares CDS Long North America HY Credit ETF Many investors still cringe when they hear the words \u201ccredit-default swap\n,\u201d which is why this ETF sticks out from the crowd. A credit-default swap, which investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or speculate on creditworthiness, is a contract that pays the buyer face value if a bond issuer fails to meet its obligations, less what the now-defaulted debt is worth in the markets. There are eight CDS ETFs in this filing that would allow investors, for the first time ever, to bet on or against the credit quality of investment grade or high-yield issuers in North America and Europe. Ticker Possibility: SWAP, UHOH 6. KraneShares CSI China Five Year Plan ETF The People\u2019s Republic of China has a series of social and economic initiatives called \u201cfive year plans\u201d in which certain growth targets are set. This ETF looks to identify those companies that will benefit from Chinese government support as these five-year plans are enacted. For example, one recent plan for solar power development calls for adding 10,000 megawatts of solar power plants, which will benefit Chinese solar companies. Ticker possibilities: PLAN, XIE 7. Global X Kazakhstan ETF An ETF for the country made famous by Sasha Baron Cohen\u2019s comic creation Borat could be a very nice investment vehicle -- Kazakhstan\u2019s oil reserves rank tenth in the world, ahead of Nigeria and Qatar. In addition, the MSCI Kazakhstan Index is up 136 percent since November 2005. Global X has filed for many other unique single-country ETFs including Morocco, Slovakia, Qatar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Hungary. Someday these may all make a lot of sense. The question is whether there's enough liquidity and/or investors for these markets. Ticker possibilities: KAZ, KSTAN, NIICE 8. AdvisorShares TreesDale Rising Rates ETF Doesn\u2019t an ETF that benefits from rising rates sound good right now? It does, but good luck getting comfortable with how this thing works. It will invest in \u201cagency interest-only mortgage-backed securities, interest-only swaps and certain other mortgage-related derivative instruments, while maintaining a negative portfolio duration with a generally positive current yield by investing in U.S. Treasury obligations and other liquid rate instruments.\u201d Okay then. Basically the fund managers want to create a portfolio where the risk of rising interest rates is effectively canceled out, while still getting the positive yield from the longer-dated bonds in the portfolio. Duration\n, by the way, is a gauge of a securities' price sensitivity to rate moves. If you're having trouble sleeping or hankering for penance, the prospectus is at www.sec.gov\n. Ticker possibilities: RISE, BENB, NOQE 9. Direxion Water Bull 3x Shares Have you ever been so bullish on water you just couldn\u2019t stand it? Didn't think so. But someday you may be, and on that day you may be able to go three times long (or short) water companies, which include pump and filter manufacturers, water utilities and irrigation equipment companies. In a future of too many people and too little water, this ETF could catch on, but right now there may not be the demand for a leveraged play on water. Even the most popular Water ETF on the market, the PowerShares Water Resources Portfolio (PHO\n), trades just 114,000 shares a day.  Ticker possibilities: DRNK, GLUG 10. Global X Top Activist Investor Holdings After the recent much-publicized battle between Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman over Herbalife stock -- which is up 49 percent this year -- investors may respond well to this ETF. It will track an index comprised of the top U.S. listed equity positions held by a select group of the world\u2019s premier activist investors. This ETF looks to be a kissing cousin to the Global X Top Holdings Guru ETF (GURU\n), which tracks hedge fund managers' 13F filings and is up 48 percent\n in the past year.

It comes with no official rebate or reward programs. Worst of all, you can\u2019t stuff it into a smartphone or laptop to pay for something online.  Yet there are no real substitutes for cold hard cash. Despite predictions of a cashless society, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the U.S. Mint churn out more currency and coins every year. The average American still uses cash for dozens of transaction each month, despite the wealth of alternatives, from good old plastic to virtual currencies to \u201cpoint and pay\u201d apps like the upcoming Apple Pay service.  Cash has advantages these high-tech replacements can\'t match. It won\'t run out of battery power, for one thing. It\'s anonymous -- invisible to the IRS, law enforcement and hackers, as well as to irritating marketers and data brokers. As Cass Sunstein notes, paying only in cash can also be a great way to monitor spending and stick to a budget. The average person pays with cash about 23 times a month, according to an analysis by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. While credit card use has doubled since 2000 and debit card use is up fivefold, cash is still used more often than either option. It\u2019s most often used for transactions under $25, even by those who claim to prefer credit or debit cards overall. And 40 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds say cash is their preferred form of payment.  Some $1.2 trillion in cash circulates outside of banks -- 15,000 tons worth. That\u2019s up 20 percent since 2011, and is the equivalent of $3,836 squeezed under the mattresses of every U.S. man, woman and child. The location of all these "Benjamins" -- it\'s mostly in $100 bills -- is a puzzle to economists and currency experts. When asked how much money they kept in their wallet or house, the average U.S. respondent said a little more than $40 in the wallet and $100 in the house, according to a 2013 Tufts University study.  Some of the money may be overseas. Less than a quarter of U.S. currency resides abroad, estimates University of Wisconsin economist Edgar Feige. Where\u2019s the rest? Legitimate business owners and those without bank accounts rely heavily on cash. And some is hidden away by the real-life equivalents of Breaking Bad\u2019s Walter White in an underground \u201ccash only\u201d economy. The U.S. may lose more than $100 billion a year in taxes on unreported income of over $400 billion, according to the Tufts study and others.  Using cash can help people carefully track their own spending, as Sunstein says. But one of its most convenient features is that it keeps everyone else in the dark.

This week\'s Digital Currencies conference in New York was different. It felt more like a Wall Street confab than the usual fellowship of the neckbeards. The suits were out in full force at the bitcoin convention on July 29, organized by American Banker. In attendance were representatives from Visa, Citigroup and other financial institutions. The professionals there were by no means bitcoin faithful. Most bankers\u2019 views on the digital currency \u2014 or virtual commodity, depending on who you ask \u2014 ranged from puzzled to noncommittal. Lester Joseph, manager of the global financial crimes intelligence group at Wells Fargo, said the bank doesn\'t have a grand plan for bitcoin. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a strategy," Joseph said during a panel called the Nexus Between Banking and Bitcoin Companies. "We just try to understand it and try to manage the risk." The American Banker event was more of an educational pursuit for these attendees, rather than a place to share enthusiasm or barter. Most of the attendees struggled to understand exactly how bitcoin \u2014 and an underlying system called the blockchain \u2014 work. But they were willing to spend an entire day to find out, listening to sessions on everything from regulation of bitcoin to merchants\u2019 use of the digital currency. The banking community\'s interest may indicate that bitcoin is growing up. The technology could be useful for financial institutions looking for new ways to move money quickly and cheaply. (The alternative is that savvy financiers outside of Wall Street could use it as a way to compete with the banks.) Bitcoin is also poised for its market debut in the form of an ETF, or exchange-traded fund, if the Winklevoss twins have their way. The conference concluded with an interview with Charlie Shrem, who co-founded a startup bitcoin exchange called BitInstant. Shrem was indicted on money-laundering charges in April by U.S. federal prosecutors in Manhattan. He\u2019s required to wear an ankle monitor and can only leave his house from Monday to Thursday between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. For his appearance on stage this week, Shrem also wore a suit.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/olgakharif', 'name': u'Olga Kharif', 'twitterhandle': u'olgakharif'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-31/wall-street-gathers-at-bitcoin-conference-to-figure-out-what-exactly-bitcoin-is', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 31, 16, 40, 8, 212000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Wall Street Gathers at Bitcoin Conference to Figure Out What Exactly Bitcoin Is'}, {'articleText': u' It\u2019s always so sweet in the beginning: You meet a financial adviser and hit it off. You smile at the same things\u2014he thinks energy stocks are undervalued, too! He\u2019s great on the phone, and it\u2019s like he just gets you\u2009\u2026\u2009and your thoughts about prudent allocation to fixed income. But you start to notice things. Your adviser always wants to go with pricey funds, never the cheaper ones you suggest. Then you find out: He\u2019s been charging fees 10\xa0times higher than you could pay elsewhere. You dump him. These are rocky times for the adviser-client relationship. The Internet makes it easy to know your options, from passive index fund giants to startups that dispense advice by algorithm. Meanwhile, Wall Street is fighting an Obama administration proposal that would require advisers to put clients\u2019 interests first. The debate raises justifiable suspicions that some advisers are motivated more by commissions than by clients\u2019 financial happiness. If you\u2019re thinking of ending a dysfunctional, costly relationship, here are four suggestions. Brandon Smith, 36, who works at a credit union in Casper, Wyo., kept telling his adviser he preferred low-cost investments. But he never got a clear answer on how much he paid in fees. He logged on to Financial Guard, a site that analyzes holdings, and found out: a huge 2.16\xa0percent. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was listening,\u201d Smith says. \u201cMaybe his own interests superseded mine.\u201d Smith fired him and moved to funds charging only 0.22\xa0percent. Tyler Clayton\u2019s financial adviser was a college friend. So it was awkward when the Columbus, Ohio, resident, 29, decided he wanted direct control of his money. His adviser just didn\u2019t seem to be adding much. When Clayton called to end things, \u201che told me it was a big mistake, that he was working for me\u201d\u2014but didn\u2019t muster any evidence Clayton found convincing. \u201cI tried to keep it brief,\u201d he says Pulling your assets from an adviser hurts more than his pride\u2014it hurts his bottom line. Sometimes resistance is good: If a client wants to gamble it all on Bitcoin, the adviser has a duty to try to talk him out of it. But if a client simply prefers a passive index fund, the adviser shouldn\u2019t object too loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between helping educate a client and scaring someone,\u201d says Patrick Clark, an adviser at online investment firm FutureAdvisor. A phone call or e-mail may be common courtesy\xa0when ending the relationship, but it\u2019s not necessary. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell them what you\u2019re doing and why,\u201d says Sheryl Garrett of the Garrett Planning Network.

Some of bitcoin\'s biggest backers, including BitPay, Blockchain.info, Circle and KnCMiner.com, wrote a letter\xa0this week in support of\xa0the existing version of bitcoin\u2014but only if it adopts some of the central ideas proposed by the renegade developers, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn. Earlier in August, the duo\xa0proposed a fork to bitcoin called Bitcoin XT, which\xa0threatened to split the community of hackers, developers and technophiles who\xa0have embraced the virtual currency. For regular users, the fork could lead to people having to juggle between different iterations\xa0of bitcoins, like the different versions of the dollar that existed in the 18th century before the American states revolted against colonial powers. This week\'s proposal is aimed at healing that rift, by adopting some of Andresen and Hearn\'s ideas, and at the same time preventing the spread of an altogether different version of bitcoin that could make things more confusing for many\xa0users and hamper wider usage of the virtual currency. Technically, the changes are focused on expanding the capacity of bitcoin\'s underlying software, so that transactions can be processed\xa0more quickly and efficiently. That would open the door for the existing bitcoin network to be used as widely and frequently as\xa0Visa\'s. Fueling these developments is the community\'s response after Bitcoin XT\'s mid-August debut. It\xa0quickly gained traction, accounting for more than\xa0a 10th of the computers running bitcoin software, while the price of bitcoin dropped to its\xa0lowest level in six months. Still, some of the biggest names in the\xa0bitcoin universe, such as Coinbase, were noticeably absent from the letter: https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/595453245884997634 "If this proposal is implemented by a big enough majority of bitcoin infrastructure providers, bitcoin will have taken a big step towards scaling up for the large transaction flow it is trying to support," says Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. For now, signs are pointing toward a resolution that will keep bitcoin intact. Andresen and Hearn reacted positively to the letter, saying that it addresses\xa0the\xa0main\xa0issue they raised. Here\'s Hearn responding to a query from Bloomberg: "It\'s great news. Bitcoin XT implements BIP 101 + other things. The letter doesn\'t say if they\'ll run XT or not, but that\'s OK: the other changes in it are useful but not as important in the same way as the block size limit is. If these companies take just the BIP 101 changes and apply them to Bitcoin Core, we\'re all good.\xa0 Ultimately, market forces will determine whether bitcoin is destined to exist as a single universal digital currency or multiple forked versions\u2014the same forces behind the number of bitcoins in circulation and their\xa0price against other real-world currencies.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/olgakharif', 'name': u'Olga Kharif', 'twitterhandle': u'olgakharif'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-25/bitcoin-backers-propose-solution-to-split-that-threatened-disruption', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 8, 25, 20, 5, 19, 788000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Backers Propose Solution to Split That Threatened Disruption'}, {'articleText': u' There was something odd\xa0about the text message when it arrived, a little before 2 p.m. on Sunday. "Hi" was all it said. The number, from an 862 area code, was unfamiliar. I wrote back: "Hi who\'s this?"\xa0 Then came the creepy part. "A friend." Followed by, "I have found your name in a certain database and was wondering if you could help explain its presence there." Hackers and extortionists of all stripes and skill levels are apparently targeting people whose names appear in Ashley Madison\'s database, which was recently stolen and dumped\xa0online. The site bills itself as the "world\'s leading married dating service for discreet encounters." The release of the company\'s internal data has the potential to be devastating to the 33 million people who were apparently using it to try to arrange extramarital affairs. It\'s also a crippling blow to the company. \xa0 In addition to the awkward conversations that are likely unfolding\xa0between people who seem to have been active on the site and their partners and employers, the information is already being deployed to try to extort money or just generally to harass people. In one incident that was reported by the security blogger Brian Krebs, an\xa0IT manager in Milwaukee intercepted a message to a married Ashley Madison user\xa0that demanded payment in return for keeping his information quiet. "If you would like to prevent me from finding and sharing this information with your significant other," the message said, "send exactly 1.0000001 Bitcoins (approx. value $225 USD) to the following address \u2026." So far, in my case, the harassment has been\xa0in the form of anonymous text messages that continued all day from someone who refused to identify himself or herself\xa0and who took\xa0a moralistic, scolding tone. "What I can\'t understand is how an intelligent person like yourself got caught in this," the person wrote. "What were you thinking?"\xa0 What I was thinking was that I was writing a cover story for Bloomberg Businessweek about Ashley Madison, which was published in 2011. I joined the site, with the handle "redvelvet2," to conduct research for the article. I quickly learned what it was like to be a woman on Ashley Madison, which involved being inundated with messages\xa0from men who behaved like lions fighting\xa0over a piece\xa0of meat.\xa0 Fortunately for me, the damage from this privacy violation is likely to be minimal. But for millions of other people, it may cause real pain.\xa0 A superintendent with the police department in Toronto, where the company is based, said this morning that multiple extortion attempts have been reported, as well as two unconfirmed reports of suicides that were\xa0tied to the data release.\xa0\u201cNobody is going to be able to erase that information,\u201d he said.

The Chicago Tribune reported\xa0that the Midlothian Police Department was the latest government department to be targeted by the virus known as Cryptolocker, which can disable a computer\xa0until an untraceable fee is paid. The Federal Trade Commission released an advisory on the virus almost a year ago in which it called the program\xa0"essentially extortion, with all your personal documents, photos, and files at risk." According to the report, which was the result of a\xa0Freedom of Information Act request, someone at the department opened an e-mail that contained the virus, which locked down the computer. \xa0A\xa0pop-up window demanded $500 "in exchange for a virtual code that would return access," according to the Tribune.

As director of trading at an exchange for Bitcoin, Silverman, 25, joined a bevy of Wall Street brokers, analysts hedge funds and other speculators taking a gamble on the new currency. They are drawn to Bitcoin\u2019s soaring value -- up about 50-fold the past year -- as well as the novelty of pioneering a new realm of finance. \u201cI think Bitcoin will be the first and oldest crypto-currency but not the last,\u201d Silverman said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a premier safe-haven asset.\u201d For now Bitcoin, a volatile and ill-understood invention, is anything but safe. A regulatory crackdown on Wall Street risk-taking and reductions in jobs and pay across the industry since the 2008 credit crisis have heightened the virtual currency\u2019s appeal to bankers looking to profit elsewhere. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts are buying and holding the currency, betting that it will hit new heights. Others are starting businesses for trading, exchanging or storing Bitcoin. Still others are pooling venture capital from Silicon Valley and elsewhere with an eye to investing in Bitcoin-related businesses. For the most part, they are individuals, not large firms. \u201cThey are front-running the rest of Wall Street,\u201d said Barry Silbert, the founder and head of SecondMarket Inc., a New York brokerage that runs a virtual currency fund. \u201cThey are excited about Bitcoin.\u201d Bitcoin, which exists as strings of computer code, was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Every day, Bitcoin \u201cminers\u201d create new Bitcoins by using ever-faster computers to solve complex mathematical problems. The price of Bitcoin returned to more than $1,000 on the Mt.Gox exchange after Zynga Inc. said Jan. 4 it would start accepting the virtual currency for some of its online social games. One Bitcoin was worth about $950 yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. That is off a high of $1,127.45 in early December, but far above its Jan. 1, 2013 price of $13.30. Bitcoin skeptics see little more than a new financial bubble. In a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research last month, economist David Yermack wrote that while Bitcoin is increasingly accepted as a medium of exchange by merchants, it lacks two other characteristics of a currency, because it is too volatile to be a unit of account or a store of value. \u201cBitcoin does not behave like a currency at all,\u201d Yermack wrote. \u201cInstead it resembles a speculative investment similar to the Internet stocks of the late 1990s.\u201d Mark Williams, a former risk manager in commodity trading, said the \u201cBitcoin mania\u201d embraced by the likes of Silverman leaves him feeling the same way as economists like Yermack. \u201cAs a former trading-floor executive, hearing this sort of hyperbole from my young traders would concern me,\u201d said Williams, who now teaches finance at Boston University. \u201cTo give you a sense of risk, currently, Bitcoin volatility is eight times higher than that of the S&P 500 making it a trade only for the most aggressive speculators.\u201d Regulators have sent mixed signals. Although U.S. agencies have said Bitcoin could be considered a legitimate means of exchange, countries including China and the U.S. have shut down some exchanges and Scandinavian countries have imposed restrictions. The regulatory crackdown hasn\u2019t quashed interest in Bitcoin on Wall Street, said Jonathan Mohan, who founded BitcoinNYC, a networking group. A New Year\u2019s Eve bash near the New York Stock Exchange drew 150 people to a site now called the NYC Bitcoin Center, a place where new companies can rent space and eventually exchange Bitcoin in person, Mohan said. Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group LLC, a New York brokerage, said the cryptographic mystery behind Bitcoin\u2019s origins feeds Wall Street\u2019s curiosity. \u201cEvery great religion or company or rock band has a dramatic creation myth,\u201d Colas wrote in a research note, recalling how Mick Jagger and Keith Richards bonded over American blues music at a train station in 1960. \u201cWhere would the Rolling Stones be if Keith hadn\u2019t chatted up Mick on the train?\u201d Of course, with most of the money coming from individuals and a few smaller firms, Wall Street\u2019s investment in Bitcoin remains modest, said Steven Englander, head of currency trading for major industrialized nations at Citigroup Inc. \u201cAnyone who says Wall Street is betting company money on the appreciation of Bitcoin is crazy,\u201d Englander said in an interview. David Woo, head of global rates and currencies at Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch, said he thinks there is a \u201csocial dimension\u201d to the interest in Bitcoin, because many people are suspicious of banks and the Federal Reserve\u2019s easy money since the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cBitcoin rides on the back of unease about unconventional monetary policy and about banks,\u201d Woo said in an interview. A report he wrote in December on Bitcoin drew hundreds of e-mails from clients, he said. Soon after, someone from the sales staff sent him a picture of a Zurich taxi sign reading, \u201cWe accept Bitcoin.\u201d Investors in Bitcoin include hedge-fund managers, who trade their own money, not client cash, Colas said. Traders who handle volatile commodity contracts, have also bought Bitcoin, as have some family offices, said Englander. Michael Novogratz, co-chief investment officer at Fortress Investment Group LLC in New York, said on Oct. 24 that he\u2019d built up a \u201cnice little Bitcoin position.\u201d Fortress executives have put money into San Francisco-based Pantera Capital Management LP, which runs a Bitcoin fund for startups. Pantera, in turn, invested in Ripple Labs, a company backed by Google Inc. that is trying to popularize its own digital currency. And Pantera has also raised a separate $147 million fund for unspecified investments, according to a Dec. 4 regulatory filing. Silbert, of SecondMarket, has also formed a venture capital fund that has invested in at least 14 Bitcoin-related companies. One is Coinsetter, a trading platform started by Jaron Lukasiewicz, who previously worked in investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Coinsetter on Dec. 27 filed documents revealing plans to raise as much as $1.5 million from accredited investors. SecondMarket\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust has drawn more interest than he expected, Silbert said. The company\u2019s goal was $10 million in the first year; according to its website, the fund currently has about $55 million, or roughly 68,000 Bitcoins. Buyers for Bitcoin need sellers, so SecondMarket scours the early adopters for supply. Alec Petro, managing partner at Bay Hill Capital Management in Duxbury, Massachusetts, sometimes sells to Silbert\u2019s fund. The partners at his fund have pooled personal assets, not those of the hedge fund, to buy Bitcoins. Large orders are hard to fill, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s treacherous to provide liquidity unless you have a great stash, and don\u2019t mind selling and never getting them back,\u201d Petro said. \u201cI got run over a few times.\u201d At times the cultures of Wall Street and Silicon Valley have clashed. Andrew Chang, a partner with Liberty City Ventures, a New York fund devoted to the virtual currency business who also works at Google Inc. on display advertising, often finds himself explaining one to the other. \u201cYou can\u2019t just whip up a company that provides Bitcoin storage, trading or payment services,\u201d said Chang, whose venture is backed by partners at a New York hedge fund, Cedar Hill Capital Partners. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with the transfer of value, you need to think 100 steps ahead to make sure you are aware of compliance, security, privacy and other issues that traditional financial institutions have been perfecting over the last 100 years.\u201d Mohan, who started the networking group, said the culture clash is evident in decisions large and small. The technology-minded members of his group are content to meet on the floor of a computer-repair shop in Chinatown. For the bankers, Mohan hosted a November meeting at Cipriani, a Wall Street event site inside the former New York Merchants Exchange building featuring Greek Revival columns and a Wedgwood dome. \u201cThe place has a butler,\u201d he said. Even as interest grows on Wall Street, so does that of Occupy Wall Street, the protest group that camped out for months in New York\u2019s Zucotti Park in 2011 to protest bank influence. Occupy activists see Bitcoin as a way to bypass a banking system they dislike, making Mohan\u2019s networking job more complex. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to have the bankers and the Occupy Wall Street people in the same room,\u201d Mohan said. The early days of Bitcoin have produced varied results for enthusiasts from Wall Street. Silverman, who managed exchange-traded funds for most of his nearly three years at Morgan Stanley, had shared a Manhattan apartment with a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader named Fred Ehrsam. Ehrsam headed for San Francisco in 2012 to found Coinbase Inc., a San Francisco startup. This month, Coinbase landed the largest investment yet, $25 million, for a Bitcoin startup. Silverman\u2019s luck hasn\u2019t been quite as good. He lost his job when the exchange he worked for, San Francisco\u2019s Tradehill, couldn\u2019t find a bank that would handle trades in and out of dollars. Undaunted, he is working on new virtual currency ventures as he studies economic literature about money. \u201cI loved bubbles when I was on Wall Street, and I still love them,\u201d Silverman said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-06/wall-street-bitcoin-fans-seek-to-make-real-money-from-virtual', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 6, 15, 52, 38, 603000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Wall Street Bitcoin Fans Try to Make Real Money From Virtual'}, {'articleText': u' When we discussed our home solar panel project in mid-2011 with friends, one of the first questions everyone asked was, \u201cWhat\u2019s the payback period before you break even?\u201d The second question, unsurprisingly, was, \u201cHow much is it costing you?\u201d but the focus always ended up on the payback. After all, if you\u2019re going to invest in green technology, you\u2019re hoping that at some point in the near future, you get ahead of the game. It turns out that something we didn\u2019t plan for\u2014our Chevrolet Volt\u2014is actually helping us boost the return on investment and cut our payback time in half. I shared details on both the solar panel project and the car before, but let me step back and recap a bit. In October 2011, we added 41 solar panels to our southern-facing roof in southeastern Pennsylvania. Each panel is rated for 230W of direct current (DC) so that works out to an array of 9.43kW DC. In our family of four, with two work-at-home adults, we average around 7,500 kWh of electricity usage. So the system may be a bit oversized for our needs\u2014about 125 percent\u2014but we planned ahead. It\u2019s a four-bedroom house so we thought the next occupants could have at least one more family member and therefore use more electricity. At the time, we were quoted a price of $5.50 per watt for the project. When you multiply that price times the 9,430 watts of the system, you get the total cost: $51,865. That\u2019s just the gross cost, however. We received a 15 percent federal tax credit for $15,560 and a state rebate check of $7,100, bringing the net cost to around $29,205. Our typical electric bill for a year had been roughly $2,500, which makes the break-even point around 11.7 years. A year after the solar panels were installed\u2014they generated 13.8 MWh in the first 12 months and you can see the real-time stats here\u2014we opted to add an electric car to our garage. So we traded in an Acura RDX and, after shopping around, replaced it with a 2013 Volt. This was to be our primary car, just as the Acura was. We have another vehicle in the garage, but it\u2019s a rarely driven sports car: a 2007 model that just passed 18,000 miles on the odometer. Since the Acura was our primary vehicle, we racked up miles quickly. Even though we both work from home, my wife and I often drive the two kids to activities or head a few miles into town most days for food or other goods. With the Acura we were averaging about $250 per month on gas as a result. Now, with the same general driving habits, we pay a maximum of $50 on gas in a given month. With the Volt\u2014you can see driving stats for that, too\u2014we\u2019ve already turned 7,228 miles in the six months of ownership. That\u2019s normal driving behavior for us: We typically drive about 15,000 miles on the main car. Of those miles, 5,255 have been solely on battery power and the car reports our gas mileage at 125.33 mpg so far. Even though we\u2019re averaging 1,250 miles per month, we\u2019re only filling up the gas tank once\u2014or maybe twice\u2014in a given month. The tank is small too: just over 9 gallons. So what does this do to our solar panel payback? It cuts it nearly in half to around six years. How so? Three-quarters of our driving is powered by electricity. Even with the addition of the Volt, which we charge every night, we still don\u2019t have an electric bill. We\u2019re at the point where we\u2019re much closer to using all of the electricity our panels produce, but we\u2019re not there yet. And we\u2019ve cut down on our gasoline expenditures as a direct result of both the car and the solar panel system, saving around $200 per month that we used to spend. That works out to $2,400 a year in gasoline savings and when added to the $2,500 in electricity bills we\u2019re no longer paying each year, you get $4,900 in net cash-flow savings. Divide that figure into the net cost of the solar panel project and it works out to 5.96 years before break-even. Best of all, the payment for the Volt is slightly less than the Acura payment was, but I don\u2019t consider that as part of the solar panel payback. There was a recent intangible benefit gained by the solar investment, as well. Just before we bought the Volt, we decided to refinance our home. The appraiser added $30,000 in value to the house just for the solar panel array. That gave us the best possible rate because of our LTV, or loan to value, ratio. Without that extra boost in the appraisal, we would have had to pay more in fees to get our low rate or simply have a marginally higher rate. I don\u2019t consider this part of the payback either, but it sure helped! \nAlso from GigaOM:\n Flash Analysis: The Fisker Debacle and Its Implications on Investing, Innovation, and Government Incentives (subscription required) \nBitcoin Buzz Stays High\u2014Even After Bubble\n \nGoogle Glass Will Soon Be Invisible\u2014and the New Normal\n \nHow ABC Plans to Use Live Streaming and the Cloud to Challenge Aereo\n \nThe Best Student Entrepreneurs at Stanford Are Working on Health Tech and Energy\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-13/adding-an-electric-car-cut-the-payback-point-of-our-solar-panel-investment-in-half', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 5, 13, 14, 55, 30, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Adding an Electric Car Cut the Payback Point of Our Solar Panel Investment in Half'}, {'articleText': u'  Mt. Gox Co., the Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo after millions of dollars\u2019 worth of virtual currency vanished from customer accounts, won a temporary halt to lawsuits it faces in the U.S. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas today agreed to shield the company\u2019s assets from creditors and halt two suits, both of which are in their early stages. The company will return to court April 1 to seek to extend the protection until the Japanese case is resolved. The Tokyo-based exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after losing Bitcoins worth about $473 million at the time. The company said in its U.S. filing that almost 750,000 customer Bitcoins and 100,000 of its own, about 7 percent of all Bitcoins in existence worldwide, were missing and probably stolen. \u201cThe facts known to date indicate that it was caused or related to a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies Bitcoin, and \u2018hacking\u2019 attacks of one or more persons,\u201d Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles said in a sworn statement filed in the Dallas court. The exchange was founded in 2011, two years after Bitcoins first appeared. Shortly after it opened in July of that year, hackers attempted to break into the system or shut it down with so-called denial of service attacks, according to court papers. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are probing possible criminal violations tied to the shutdown of Mt. Gox, two people familiar with the matter said last month. The Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the digital currency, said last month that it briefed federal prosecutors about possible theft at Mt. Gox. A spokeswoman for Bharara, Jennifer Queliz, today declined to comment on whether a software flaw would effect a federal investigation, citing the office\u2019s policy to neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation. Last month, Mt. Gox was sued in federal court in Chicago by an Illinois resident accusing it of misappropriation and fraud. The company also faces a $75 million breach-of-contract suit filed by CoinLab Inc. in Washington state. Mt. Gox filed for creditor protection yesterday in federal court in Dallas under Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which can be used to shield assets while the main bankruptcy proceeding is carried out in another country. The petition listed about $37.7 million in assets and $63.9 million in liabilities. Jed MacCaleb, who built the initial Mt. Gox software, owns 12 percent of the company. Tibanne Co., a Japanese company, owns the rest, according to court documents. The U.S. bankruptcy is In re MtGox Co., 14-bk-31229, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas).

Small business owners and self-employed individuals who wait until the last minute are prone to dumb mistakes: forgetting to sign a return, goofing up on the math, or filling in the wrong Social Security number. All those errors will get your 1040 form kicked back and delay any refund you may be owed, says Gloria Birnkrant, a Beverly Hills (Calif.) certified public accountant whose clients include many small and midsize business owners and self-employed individuals. Here are some strategies from Birnkrant and other experts to\xa0cope with the last-minute tax rush: E-File\xa0your return. It\u2019s quicker and more secure than mailing paper tax forms. If your business brought in little income in 2013, or you\u2019re disabled or elderly, take advantage of free tax prep services through the\xa0VITA program. Sweat the small details. That includes checking and double-checking Social Security numbers and your math or using a software program that crunches the numbers for you. Make sure you\u2019ve attached all required documents, such as brokerage statements and your\xa0Schedule C. Sign and date your return. Remember that you and your spouse must both sign a joint return, even if only one of you has income. Anyone you pay to prepare your return must also sign it. Include your payment. Make your check for federal taxes out to United States Treasury\u2014not to the IRS\u2014and be sure your state payment is written to the proper agency as well. Enclose your check with your return or your payment voucher if you\u2019re filing your return electronically\u2014don\u2019t staple it, though. On the check, write your and your spouse\u2019s Social Security numbers, your daytime phone numbers, the tax year, and the type of form that you\u2019re filing, such as 1040 or 1040EZ. Write off your home office. Determine whether you can use the simplified\xa0home office deduction, which allows you to write off $5 per square foot of home office space, up to $1,500 for 300 square feet. So far,\xa0Birnkrant says most of her clients itemize deductions and claim more than $1,500 for the cost of home offices when they include other costs such as Internet service. Pay estimated taxes. If you\u2019re self-employed, don\u2019t forget your first 2014 estimated tax payment is due April 15. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to make some projections, since 55 tax rules expired at the end of 2013, and it\u2019s unknown how many of them will be reinstated,\u201d says Barbara Weltman, contributing editor to\xa0J.K. Lasser\u2019s Small Business Taxes 2014\xa0(Wiley 2013). One way to avoid penalties is to take your 2013 tax liability and pay 100 percent of it (110 percent for high-income earners), split into four installments, she says. Look for savings in past and future tax years.\xa0If your 2013 business income is low, opt to depreciate equipment purchases over time rather than all at once, for example. \u201cLook at carryovers, like deductions and tax credits that you weren\u2019t able to use in prior tax years but might be applied this year if your business is profitable enough,\u201d Weltman suggests. \u201cIf you can amend prior-year returns, you might get better refunds for those years.\u201d Tally your Bitcoin taxes. The\xa0IRS this week issued guidelines on the treatment of virtual currency. \u201cVirtual currencies like Bitcoin are treated as property, not currency,\u201d says Ebong Eka, a Washington (D.C.) CPA and the author of START ME UP! The No-Business-Plan Business Plan\xa0(Career Press 2014). If you sold something and received virtual currency for it, you will have to pay tax on the fair market value of that currency. And you may also have to pay self-employment taxes on any Bitcoins you\u2019ve mined, if that activity constitutes your business, Eka says. Fund your retirement. Yes, it\u2019s 2014, but you can still contribute to an IRA for the 2013 tax year through April 15. For tax year 2013, you may deduct a maximum contribution of $5,500 to a traditional IRA if you are less than 50 years old; those 50 or older may deduct up to $6,500, says Terry Durkin, director of the\xa0National Association of Enrolled Agents, a society of federally licensed tax practitioners. If you qualify, that IRA contribution could lower your tax liability or boost your refund. \u201cI had a client this year who owed $900. He put $6,500 in his IRA and wound up getting a refund of $400,\u201d Durkin says. Self-employed people who file for\xa0extensions\xa0have until Oct. 15, 2014, to fund a 2013 SEP-IRA. Avoid penalties.\xa0Failing\xa0to file your tax returns on time or failing to pay taxes you\xa0owe will cost you. The corporate tax filing date was March 17, so if your company is organized as an S corporation, every shareholder will be charged $195 a month, for a maximum of 12 months, until your return is filed, says Louis Balbirer, director of tax services at\xa0Kaufman Rossin in Ft.

Their coach, a software entrepreneur originally from Mumbai, viewed the game as an outsider\u2014and what he saw was rampant inefficiency. Teams routinely retreated to the half court on defense, conceding territory to their opponents. His girls instead defended the full court on every possession. The strategy helped take a team lacking talent and size to the championships of National Junior Basketball. To Gladwell, the story illustrated how traditions become blind spots. \u201cPlaying insurgent basketball did not guarantee victory. It was simply the best chance an underdog had of beating Goliath,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd yet somehow that lesson has escaped the basketball establishment.\u201d The anecdote became the opening passage of the book David and Goliath, another fixture on bestseller lists. Yet the basketball establishment was unmoved. Underdog teams at every level of the game, and especially at the top, do not embrace nonstop full-court defense. Apologists for the status quo noted that defensive strategy is more complicated than Gladwell had allowed. College basketball players are \u201cnot 12 years old\u201d and don\u2019t struggle with basic ball handling. But that outsider coach, Vivek Ranadive, didn\u2019t stop with preteen basketball. Last year he became the controlling owner of the Sacramento Kings, putting him inside the NBA. He talked about creating the \u201cNBA 3.0,\u201d a league built in the mold of Silicon Valley. He crowdsourced the Kings\u2019 draft preparation. He built apps to anticipate every whim of fans in the arena. He gave Google Glass to the team mascot. He accepted Bitcoins. Despite the front-office novelties, the Kings\u2019 strategy on the court was familiar enough to the basketball establishment. There was no full-time, full-court press\u2014just rumblings about big changes to come. In October, Zach Lowe\u2019s NBA column for Grantland included this nugget: \u201cOwner Vivek Ranadiv\xe9 has pitched the idea to the team\u2019s brain trust of playing 4-on-5 defense and leaving one player to cherry-pick, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\u201d This was beyond what even Malcolm Gladwell might sanction. Cherry-picking, or leaving a player on the offensive side of the court, is the stuff of lazy pickup basketball. The idea that an NBA team might try it was laughable, and basketball obsessives on Twitter guffawed accordingly. But the Kings, as Lowe noted, were not about to try it even if their D-League team might. Then came a column from Yahoo! on the firing of Kings coach Michael Malone: \u201cThe [Kings'] owner played the part of a fantasy league owner, treating the Kings like a science experiment. He shared tactical experiences with Malone about coaching his child\u2019s youth team, and pressed him to consider playing four-on-five defense, leaking out a defender for cherry-picking baskets. Some semblance of that strategy is expected to be employed.\u201d This is a great moment not just for basketball fans, but for anyone interested in the culture of Silicon Valley. The rhetoric of disruption\u2014and its implied critique of whatever came before\u2014could get an unusually pure and public test. Cherry-picking in the NBA would either succeed or fail in spectacular fashion. Everything we thought we knew about basketball is either wrong or right.

The new feature essentially turns Instagram into a messaging app, allowing users to send the equivalent of direct messages to friends along with a picture or video. This feature obviously pits Instagram against a horde of other messaging apps and micro-social networks, including Twitter\u2014which just launched a new photo-enhanced direct-messaging feature of its own\u2014as well as Snapchat, Kik, WhatsApp, and Facebook\u2019s own branded messenger service. It\u2019s getting so smartphone users could probably fill up an entire screen with just apps that involve photo-sharing and/or messaging of some kind. Everyone seems to want to be \u201cthe e-mail of chat,\u201d or the one ring that rules them all, as The Lord of the Rings put it. But is such a thing even possible? I don\u2019t think so. And even if it is possible, I would argue that by the time it actually occurs, the entire market will have become so commoditized that there will be no point in owning it. This is not the first time we have seen this particular movie: Anyone old enough to remember Windows 95 can probably recall the cumbersome and Balkanized environment we had in desktop messaging at one point\u2014with AOL\u2019s Instant Messenger, Microsoft\u2019s MSN Messenger, and numerous wannabe one-ring apps like ICQ (which inadvertently helped spark a technology startup boom in Israel). It got so you had to run three apps just to stay in touch with everyone you wanted to chat with on different platforms. The biggest roadblock to total messaging domination by any one provider isn\u2019t just that the market is incredibly fragmented, it\u2019s the reason why that fragmentation exists: namely, that different networks serve different purposes or solve different problems, and they can\u2019t all be shoved into one single offering\u2014as much as Mark Zuckerberg would like to think they can (Google is also trying to do this by forcing everything into Google Hangouts, another failed strategy). Facebook has certainly tried this gambit numerous times with Messenger, Poke, its highly touted \u201csocial inbox\u201d e-mail offering (which as far as I can tell hardly anyone actually uses) and probably half a dozen other attempts I\u2019m forgetting. But while some people I know use Facebook Messenger and like it, many of my friends and family do not. When it comes to my children, who are teenagers or older, text messaging is the killer app and always will be. Apple\u2019s iMessage was great when everyone used iPhones, but now that a few of us are on Android that no longer works, so it\u2019s either text or in some cases a Twitter DM. Gchat works sometimes, but not everyone uses Gmail. Outside the family, meanwhile, it could be anything from Snapchat to Path to Facebook to e-mail, or half a dozen apps in between\u2014someone tried to connect with me on something called Line the other day and I had literally never even heard of it, and I theoretically do this for a living. While Facebook has the benefit of being connected to the people who theoretically matter in your life, whether they are friends or family, other messaging apps and services have their own distinct qualities. I can see why Instagram wanted to add messaging\u2014or thought it made sense\u2014because I have connected with a whole separate group of people based on the images they share or their responses to my images. That\u2019s a very specific type of interaction, though. Snapchat obviously has the benefit of ephemerality, which allows you to share photos without having to worry about how good they look, because they aren\u2019t going to stick around anyway. That removes a lot of the social stress from the sharing, and that\u2019s a positive feature in many ways\u2014but Facebook and Instagram can\u2019t just add ephemerality, because it\u2019s not in their DNA, and it\u2019s not what people associate with those apps. So are we doomed to live in a Balkanized chat environment forever, with multiple silos, none of which communicate with each other? At least for the time being, that appears to be the case. And by the time a single app or protocol like e-mail or xmpp comes along\u2014if it ever does\u2014everyone will have moved on to the next hot market, whatever that might be. \nAlso from Gigaom:\n Averting Disaster (subscription required) \nMath Suggests iPhone Market Share to Hit 68 Percent by 2017\n \nBitcoin\u2019s a Risky Business for Consumers, European Banking Authority Warns\n \nUpdated: Twitter Tries to Improve Its Block Feature, but Critics Say It Has Done the Exact Opposite\n \nNew Nexus 5 Appears to Be Shipping With Slight Physical Tweaks\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-13/facebook-cant-expect-a-messaging-monopoly', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 13, 17, 15, 23, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Facebook Can't Expect a Messaging Monopoly"}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin prices plunged almost 10 percent today after a report that China\u2019s central bank ordered banks and payment companies to close the trading accounts of more than 10 exchanges.

The restrictions would be the latest on the commodity from the People\u2019s Bank of China, which has sought to limit dealings that may be used to launder money or evade capital controls.

Shrem is scheduled to appear on a panel after today\u2019s premiere of \u201cThe Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,\u201d a documentary about the cryptocurrency\u2019s journey from obscurity to notoriety. The 24-year-old got permission to leave his parents\u2019 home in Brooklyn, where he\u2019s confined under house arrest, and he\u2019ll wear a court-monitored ankle bracelet to the event at the SVA Theater in Manhattan. He\u2019s accused of conspiring to launder $1 million worth of bitcoins to help customers of the online Silk Road marketplace make illegal purchases anonymously. \u201cThis will be a really big piece of history,\u201d he said in a telephone interview, talking about the movie. The filmmakers \u201cgot everything at the perfect timing\u201d in bitcoin\u2019s short, turbulent history. The 95-minute documentary tells the digital currency\u2019s tale through entrepreneurs such as Shrem and a cast of bitcoin enthusiasts, led by Daniel Mross, the brother of the director. It was Daniel Mross\u2019s hobby as a bitcoin miner -- using computers to solve cryptographic problems to verify transactions and unlock new bitcoins -- that inspired Nicholas Mross to start making the movie two years ago, when he said there were \u201ca lot of underground stories\u201d about the money. \u201cWe expected it to just still be a fringe thing when we were done that we could help explain to everybody, and it just kind of went crazy,\u201d said Daniel Mross, 35, a programmer in Pittsburgh. \u201cIt was kind of a roller-coaster ride.\u201d The film traces bitcoin\u2019s booms and busts and the emergence of entrepreneurs and investors, such as Erik Voorhees, co-founder of Coinapult, and Jered Kenna, co-founder of the San Francisco-based exchange Tradehill Inc., which suspended trading last year after banks closed its accounts. They\u2019re expected to attend the sold-out premiere. Bitcoin was under the radar for years after its open-source code was written by a mysterious programmer or group of programmers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto; the code was made public in 2009. Not tied to a central issuing or regulatory authority, the money relies on a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions. For years its main exchange was Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo. The documentary\u2019s filming started in May 2012 and ended last month, covering the currency\u2019s highs and recent lows, including the arrest of Shrem, who was vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation trade group, and the collapse of Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy after claiming to have lost coins valued at the time at more than $500 million. \u201cIt was difficult to figure out when we were done,\u201d Nicholas Mross, 31, said. \u201cAs more and more things were happening in bitcoin, it was tough to decide.\u201d The final frames shot were of Dorian Nakamoto, a 64-year-old California engineer who was identified in a March 6 Newsweek article as bitcoin\u2019s creator. He has denied the claim, and Newsweek has said it \u201cstands strongly\u201d behind its story. For Shrem, the premiere will be a break as his criminal case proceeds. He intends to plead not guilty when he\u2019s arraigned, according to his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo. A third of the way into \u201cThe Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,\u201d Shrem talks of his fear of going to jail as he wonders about the U.S. government\u2019s reaction to the computer-driven currency. \u201cIt\u2019s super-terrifying,\u201d he says to the camera. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to jail and I don\u2019t want to become a martyr either.\u201d He was taken into custody as he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Jan. 26 after giving a speech about bitcoin in Amsterdam. Jailed for about 20 hours, Shrem said he learned to make coffee in his cell toilet and discussed economics with his guards. He and a co-defendant are charged in an April 10 indictment with two counts of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, money-laundering conspiracy and willfully failing to file suspicious-activity reports with banking authorities. Silk Road customers used bitcoins as a venue to buy and sell drugs. Asked if he had in fact ended up a martyr, Shrem said in the interview, \u201cI am not dead, I am not in prison but I am definitely taking a hit. A lot of the information that they are using against me I voluntarily gave them. The case against me is very weak and will probably never even see a courtroom, but it is just the fact that I am a young kid and I am easily scare-able, and I am scared, frankly.\u201d Federal prosecutors at his bail hearing called Shrem a \u201cbitcoin millionaire.\u201d While Shrem declined to discuss the details of his case, he said that prosecutors \u201cwant to take down a lot of these early guys who are the biggest public figures for bitcoin.\u201d \u201cBitcoiners feel like they are fighting a war,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they are like soldiers in an army.\u201d Shrem discovered bitcoins on a website in 2011, when he was a senior at Brooklyn College, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in April. He started BitInstant, which allowed customers to purchase the currency. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are seeking regulatory approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, were among BitInstant\u2019s investors. Daniel Mross, a BitInstant customer, is shown in the documentary losing most of his bitcoins investing in mining equipment, though he declined to say how much that was. In the bitcoin world, \u201cthere is no too big to fail,\u201d he said. But \u201cthere is something to be said for interacting in an economy with a lot of people willing to take risks, willing to fail and accept the consequences.\u201d Shrem said the currency would continue to develop. \u201cSatoshi gave us an empty island, he gave us the new world and we have to build the roads, bridges and tunnels,\u201d he said. \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day but Rome is beautiful.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-23/bitcoiner-shrem-a-tribeca-festival-star-in-ankle-bracelet', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 4, 23, 20, 3, 43, 689000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoiner Shrem a Tribeca Festival Star in Ankle Bracelet'}, {'articleText': u'  A California engineer identified by Newsweek magazine as the creator of the digital currency Bitcoin \u201cunconditionally\u201d denied the report and retained a lawyer.

There is no law to define Bitcoin and relevant ministries are gathering information on it, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s cabinet said in a statement in response to questions from an opposition party lawmaker. Bitcoin transactions can be taxed, according to the statement obtained by Bloomberg News. Japan isn\u2019t the only country grappling with the regulation of Bitcoin amid reports of hacking into exchanges including Mt. Gox and concern that the virtual currency can be used for money laundering. In the U.S., states are wrestling with how digital-currency businesses could be regulated as money transmitters, while Russia has said Bitcoin is illegal under current law and Finland plans to treat it as a commodity.

Earlier this week Aso, who also oversees the banking regulator, said it wasn\u2019t clear yet whether Mt. Gox\u2019s failure was a crime. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy on Feb. 28, saying 850,000 Bitcoins were missing and may have been stolen by hackers. The coins are valued at more than $550 million, based on an index of current prices compiled by Coindesk. Fewer than 1 percent of its creditors are from Japan, the exchange\u2019s lawyers said. Flexcoin, a Bitcoin bank based in Alberta, Canada, was forced to shut down this week after hackers stole 896 units of the digital currency, the Guardian newspaper reported March 5. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has no central issuing authority. Dorian S.

She concludes that he\u2019s a guy living near Los Angeles, using the name Dorian S. Nakamoto. A few thoughts: Sometimes the answer is right there in front of you: Satoshi hunting is the Bitcoin community\u2019s version of snipe hunting. Many people assume he is a myth, or the name of a group of people working together. The New Yorker took a shot at it in 2011.\xa0In December, a researcher named Skye Grey said the culprit was probably Nick Szabo, a former economics professor at George Washington. Goodman\u2019s investigation started with the premise that the creator was an actual person with the name Satoshi Nakamoto, and she seems to have found him. Dorian S. Nakamoto has a background working on technology for the military and is \u201cvery wary of the government, taxes, and people in charge,\u201d according to his daughter. After being lured into a correspondence over model trains, he stopped responding when asked about Bitcoin and called the police when a reporter showed up at his house. \u201cI am no longer involved in that and cannot discuss it,\u201d he told Goodman. \u201cIt\u2019s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.\u201d Here\u2019s the case for this not being the guy: This evidence is mostly circumstantial. After finding someone whose background seems right, Goodman looked at the Bitcoin creator\u2019s writing style in English and code, as well as the timing of when the code was written, to point to Dorian S. Nakamoto. But if someone else was involved, the moniker must have been intended to point at this man. Maybe Nakamoto\u2019s name was used as a tribute, or maybe as a prank. If you\u2019re looking for the conspiracy theory, there it is. Because this is a story about Bitcoin \u2026: Newsweek posted its story at 6 a.m., with Bitcoin trading at about $670. Just after 11 a.m., it was at $656. Someone has to answer for the violation of Nakamoto\u2019s privacy: Newsweek is already being criticized for the article. Nakamoto is clearly a man who values his privacy, and he may be in possession of a sizable fortune. More people will come knocking on his door. Reporters are already crowding around the poor guy\u2019s house. Journalists, of course, write stories that sometimes make things uncomfortable for their subjects. Not everyone thinks this is appropriate. But Goodman originally got Nakamoto\u2019s e-mail address from a company he bought a model train from. Doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019d want to do business with that company, does it? It\u2019d be a good time for Nakamoto to cash in: A second mystery surrounding Nakamoto\u2019s identity is his fortune, whose value Newsweek pegs at $400 million. While Bitcoin is regularly referred to as anonymous, it is more accurate to call is pseudonymous. There is a key identifying Satoshi\u2019s coins, and people were watching to see what would happen to them. Further, if Nakamoto wanted to cash out his fortune, he\u2019d have to go through an exchange, which would require revealing his real name. (Which, apparently, we already knew.)

It was underwritten by Kobalt Music Group, a music publisher that is trying to make transparency its calling card. But the numbers largely line up with a\xa0widely cited study carried out by Ernst & Young and French record label trade group SNEP. A quick primer: Every time a song is streamed, two types of royalties must be paid out. The larger one goes to the artist that\xa0performed the song or, more\xa0precisely, to the company that owns the\xa0rights to those royalties, usually a record label.\xa0The other goes to the songwriter or, again, to the company controlling those rights. At times, streaming services\xa0don\u2019t\xa0even pay those companies directly but rely on organizations that manage royalties for large groups of copyright owners. At each step\xa0along\xa0the line, another company takes a cut.\xa0 Here\u2019s Berklee\u2019s breakdown of the typical way that the royalties for a song streamed on Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, or a\xa0rival\xa0subscription service would be divvied up.\xa0 \u201cIt\u2019s a typical\xa0collective-action problem, where everybody is\xa0benefiting\xa0in a small way from the\xa0inefficiencies\xa0in the way things are done,\u201d said D.A. Wallach, a musician and investor who has also spent the last four years as Spotify\u2019s artist in residence.\xa0 There are lots of\xa0ways money gets stuck in the system. Record companies, or labels, cut deals in which\xa0they take less-generous royalty rates in exchange for equity in the streaming services themselves\u2014and the chance to really cash in if these services go public or are gobbled up by even larger companies; individual musicians generally aren\u2019t going to be included in those paydays.\xa0Streaming deals may include service fees that are paid to labels and\xa0aren\u2019t split with artists. Many artists don\u2019t start getting royalty checks until their labels have recouped the expenses they spent on marketing and other costs. And labels taking\xa0large advance payments for the royalties that streaming services expect to pay out can find themselves with a chunk of money left over. Berklee\u2019s report estimates that artists may have lost\xa0hundreds of millions of dollars by not getting fully cut in on this\xa0cash. The Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group for record labels and distributors, takes some issue with some of the arguments.\xa0"Unfortunately, some of the report\'s findings are flawed and based on anecdotes, misinformation and unsubstantiated rumors, rather than facts and analysis. \xa0And some publicly available information didn\'t find its way into the report at all," says Jonathan Lamy, a spokesman for the group, in an email. According to RIAA, the percentage of revenue that record labels pay in royalties has increased in recent years.\xa0 There\u2019s an even more basic problem. All that math applies only after\xa0the correct rights-holders have been identified. Berklee estimates that 20 percent to 50\xa0percent of\xa0money generated by streaming\xa0never filters back\xa0through\xa0to the people whose songs were played.\xa0 \u201cUnfortunately, the adage \u2018follow the money\' leads only to a dense thicket of micropayments and \u2018black boxes\u2019 where relationships among rights, royalties, processes, and participants, in the eyes of many, are deliberately obscured or, at best, have become hopelessly complex and outdated,\u201d the researchers wrote in their report.\xa0One unnamed band, a Grammy-winning group on a major label, shared its quarterly royalty report with Berklee. It consisted of 119 pages of PDF\xa0files.\xa0 Determining when songs are\xa0played and who should be paid is one area with plenty of room for improvement, Berklee\'s Panay says. Performing-rights\xa0organizations have\xa0traditionally\xa0been in charge of figuring out\xa0when, say, a radio station in Brussels or Boise, Idaho, played a song and then making\xa0sure the songwriter got paid. It\'s a labor-intensive process probably\xa0best handled by robots. The PROs would still cut deals\xa0through\xa0collective bargaining, for example, but such a change could affect the price they can demand for their services. To replace this whole Rube Goldberg setup with modern technology, you\'d need a system that tracks when music is played and who owns the various rights to\xa0each song, something the music industry has tried and failed to create in the past. And you\'d need a way to link that to a payment method. This is\xa0where the blockchain\u2014the technology underlying Bitcoin\u2014comes into play. By keeping a public tally of each transaction that\xa0takes place, the blockchain lets people who don\u2019t trust one\xa0another do business without fear that they\u2019re getting ripped off. (This is why it has been so popular among\xa0drug dealers.) Such a system\xa0would automatically divide each payment into the proper\xa0piles and distribute it immediately.\xa0Like Bitcoin itself, it\'s clever, in theory. Still,\xa0it\u2019s far from clear how an industry that has traditionally been less than\xa0savvy when it comes to technology would make a transition to the impenetrable\xa0world of Bitcoin.\xa0 The initial suggestion came from Wallach of Spotify. Last December, he\xa0posted an essay on Medium called Bitcoin for Rockstars\xa0that laid out the basics of a blockchain-based royalty\xa0distribution\xa0system. Several\xa0startups are already working on early versions of the idea, says Barry Silbert, a prominent investor in Bitcoin, though\xa0none are ready for prime time.\xa0The\xa0design and consulting firm IDEO was also drawn to the idea of blockchain, and is running an incubator for startups that\xa0want to use the technology for applications in various industries, including\xa0home buying, health, and music.\xa0 \u201cTheres\u2019 no reason this shouldn\u2019t happen. You have a really archaic infrastructure that these media businesses are sitting on, and the people who really suffer are the people who create stuff,\u201d Wallach says.\xa0 He\xa0acknowledges that turning the idea into a reality is likely to be a years-long process\u2014one he has no yearning\xa0to\xa0dive into.\xa0\u201cThe reason I\u2019m not doing it," Wallach says, "is\xa0because\xa0I\xa0don\u2019t\xa0want to spend a decade on it.\u201d\xa0 July 15, 10:30 am: Updates to include comment from RIAA in 10th paragraph.\xa0', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-14/can-bitcoin-shine-a-light-into-streaming-music-s-money-traps-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 7, 14, 3, 56, 3, 203000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Your Streaming Music Payments Are Going Where?'}, {'articleText': u' Tim Draper is sitting. This is not his natural state. An entire half of his 6-foot-4-inch hulking body cannot express itself. But he\u2019s willing to be immobilized at Los Angeles\u2019s BLD restaurant for breakfast\u2014vegan, and actually his second breakfast since he already had cereal because, come on, it\u2019s 9 a.m.\u2014to promote his big idea. It\u2019s really just one of his many big ideas, but this one requires some serious salesmanship. Draper wants to divide California into six \u201cstartup\u201d states that will compete for citizens and businesses. It\u2019s early March, and he says he\u2019s willing to spend millions to get the 807,615 signatures required so his initiative can be on the California ballot by fall. It\u2019s not going to be easy since the interested parties, as of this morning, are roughly the two of us. A billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist who hit it big funding Hotmail, Skype, Tesla Motors, and Chinese search engine Baidu, Draper has gone from Democrat to Republican to Libertarian to Draperist; the Draper party (of one) believes that government\u2019s problem is that it lacks competition. \u201cI\u2019ve met every governor since Reagan and they\u2019re all great people. And I\u2019ve met lots of state employees and they\u2019re all great people. So I came to the conclusion that California is ungovernable,\u201d he says. Accepting bad governance, Draper notes, is old thinking. \u201cEgypt went down because of Facebook and Twitter,\u201d he says. \u201cTunisia went down because of Facebook and Twitter. Ukraine went down for the first time due to instant messaging. Bad government is not going to be tolerated.\u201d So he plans to use social media, among other things, to found six states. He picked six for some population and economic specialty reasons (Hollywood and movies, Napa and wine), but he\u2019ll tell you that he really did it because six are even better than two, and because 20 states\u2014well, 20 states might make people think he\u2019s crazy. Which many do anyway. Draper, 56, might have missed his calling as a Tony Robbins-type self-improver. Even sitting down, he\u2019s all energy and optimism in an oversize suit. He\u2019s got an easy, nervous laugh that erupts after most of the things he says. He discovered long ago that a tie makes a perfect billboard; today\u2019s is for Save the Children, a charity where his mother served on the board for more than a decade. He\u2019s also wearing a friendship bracelet, made by kids he saw earlier at BizWorld.org, a nonprofit he created in 1997 that has taught nearly half a million children the fun of business. Unlike most people with enormous eyebrows, Draper\u2019s don\u2019t lend him Sam the Eagle gravitas. His turn up at the ends, as if he\u2019s perpetually hearing something that surprises him. Probably something he said. \n  Draper often starts his Six Californias spiel by saying that California\u2019s public schools have gone from first to 47th, its prison situation is untenable, and its business climate the worst in the nation. Trying new tax codes, immigration rules, and regulations would spur on all six states, he says, from what would be the richest state in the country (San Francisco and environs) to the poorest (right next door). Exactly how the six would share resources or divide up the state university system is unclear. He calls two of the six states Jefferson and Silicon Valley. Jefferson is in the northernmost, conservative part of California. Its name comes from a movement dating to 1941. Silicon Valley is home. The others are North California, Central California, West California, and South California. \u201cThey can be named whatever. It can be crowdnamed,\u201d he says. And, like an anti-Mason and Dixon, he is unconcerned about boundaries, which the states can also work out themselves. Many assume that a man with such an improbable plan\u2014even if the ballot passes in California, the 49 other states aren\u2019t eager to endow what was California with 10 more senators\u2014knows nothing about politics. But Draper isn\u2019t without political experience. He served on the California State Board of Education, and he says it was there that he began to lose faith in the system. Nor is Six Californias Draper\u2019s first state ballot initiative. In 2000 he spent $23.4\xa0million to get school vouchers voted on. \u201cAfter the teachers\u2019 union was finished with it, it went from 80\xa0percent approval to 30\xa0percent. We got clobbered,\u201d he says. \u201cI had no idea what I was in for.\u201d This time, he says, he does.\xa0\xa0In immigrant-rich Silicon Valley, Tim Draper is a blue blood, a third-generation Bay Area venture capitalist who grew up riding his Sting-Ray bicycle down the dirt path that is now Sand Hill Road, where the most powerful VC firms are located. Whenever he has a meeting in Menlo Park, he bikes there so he can ride up and down the parking lot ramp he liked as a kid. Draper\u2019s father, William Henry Draper III, has been friends with George Herbert Walker Bush since they were in Skull and Bones at Yale, was chief of the United Nations Development Programme (third-highest-ranking job at the United Nations), and ran the Export-Import Bank for five years under Ronald Reagan. His grandfather, William Henry Draper Jr., was undersecretary of war, the first ambassador to NATO, and founded, upon President Eisenhower\u2019s request, the Draper Committee, which annoyed Republicans and Democrats alike by recommending more foreign aid, most of it military. He then moved west and started Silicon Valley\u2019s first venture capital firm, hiring Bill, who later started his own firm. Now 86, Bill still goes to an office, running a fund that provides $100,000 a year to nonprofit startups, many working on green energy. \u201cMy grandfather has the right to brag so much, and he never says anything. My dad\u2009\u2026\u2009doesn\u2019t brag\u2014but he shares more,\u201d says Tim\u2019s daughter Jesse, 30, who interviews business leaders on The Valley Girl Show, an online program that starts airing on Fox affiliate KTVU on Aug. 3. Bill Draper is skeptical about the Six Californias plan but has learned not to doubt his son. \u201cHe got hit three times by automobiles on his bicycle. He\u2019s kind of a lucky guy as well as a risk-taker,\u201d he says, going on to recount a time when, in China, Tim at midnight walked up to a street vendor who was selling what he claimed was snake blood that would improve one\u2019s brain. Tim downed a cup and was fine. \u201cTim has a way of getting away with murder, almost,\u201d Bill says. Tim doesn\u2019t turn down much, either in business or in life. When his sister, Polly, an actress who was nominated for an Emmy Award for her role on Thirtysomething, shot a movie about her sons in a rock band, Draper funded it as long as he could have a part. It did so well, Nickelodeon turned it into a sitcom, The Naked Brothers Band. That\u2019s how Draper became Principal Joe Schmoke for three seasons. \n  He owns an island, of course. Well, part of one. He owns it with another couple. It\u2019s off Tanzania, and it\u2019s got a hotel on it. He writes poetry, paints, and at Christmas insists everyone in the family make homemade gifts and encourages them to put on sketches. He\u2019s gone to parties dressed in a spacesuit or a superhero outfit even though they weren\u2019t costume parties. If he hasn\u2019t worked out in a week or he\u2019s missed his twice-weekly 5 a.m. basketball game, he\u2019ll just start running. Sometimes he\u2019ll run so far, he has to call a family member or friend to pick him up, and his legs will be sore for days. There\u2019s a song about Draper, called The Riskmaster. It\u2019s a song he wrote and sings in public. On YouTube you can see him sing it at a conference, in front of a huge image of him arriving at a party on an elephant. He acts out the best parts and has created a dance for it that sadly hasn\u2019t caught on. The chorus goes: He\u2019s the riskmaster.\n      Lives fast, and drives faster.\n      Skates on the edge of disaster.\n      He is the riskmaster. You can also see him sing it on a video he shot in which he\u2019s accepting, in absentia, an Astia award for funding female startups. He removes a piece of clothing for every woman-founded startup he\u2019s backed. Upon removing his shirt for Anjula Acharia-Bath from DesiHits, a Bollywood fan site (\u201cAnjula, I really like you\u201d), he changes the lyrics to \u201cshe,\u201d since the song is specifically about an entrepreneur, not Draper himself. Draper\u2019s blog is also called The Riskmaster, and it links to his second, less catchy song, a hard-core antitax anthem called Take My Money. \u201cSo many laws/ Nothing is legal/ But Congress and the president are all looking regal\u2009\u2026\u2009Take my money/ Never say thanks\u2009\u2026\u2009Take my money/ Piss it away.\u201d Surprisingly, Draper has had alcohol exactly once in his life, a half of a bottle of Champagne on his 21st birthday. Like his father before him and his sons after, Draper took \u201cthe deal,\u201d a family promise not to drink or smoke before 21 in exchange for an incentive (for Tim, it was a trip to Europe). Draper was the only one who decided not to imbibe again. \u201cOh, we all drink, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d says Bill. \u201cHe makes up his mind about something, and he goes for it.\u201d The pre-2014, elephant-riding, hanging-from-Cirque-du-Soleil-trapeze-during-his-50th-birthday-party Draper was the conservative Draper. But in November 2013, he took a leave (he calls it a \u201cresearch binger\u201d) from Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the VC firm he founded in 1985. Now he\u2019s completely unfettered, since his longtime partner, John Fisher, whom he met during his two-year stint at investment bank Alex. Brown & Sons, was the serious, analytical one who kept him aware of reality. These days, through his Draper fund and personal fortune, he operates like the world is Burning Man for startups. (Yes, he\u2019s been to Burning Man, and yes, he loved it.) \n  Draper, who majored in electrical engineering at Stanford, had wanted to start his own company after Harvard B-school, but couldn\u2019t decide between four ideas: personal submarines, holograms, digital music, or a new global stock market. So he started his own firm in 1985 with $2\xa0million of family money and a $6\xa0million loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration and nearly lost it all before a $270,000 investment in Parametric Technology, a design software company now known as PTC, paid off 500-fold. He was known for choosing companies by instinct and personal relationships instead of doing a lot of research and number crunching; in 2001, eCompany Now named him the second-dumbest VC in Silicon Valley. (As he sings in the darkest part of The Riskmaster\u2019s tale of entrepreneurship, \u201cBankers demanding blood refund/ Company\u2019s looking moribund/ Even Draper will not fund!\u201d) Draper\u2019s smartest bet was in Steve Jurvetson, another electrical engineer who applied to his firm in 1994 while still at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Jurvetson as much as anyone made DFJ a big global firm, although it has since closed overseas offices and does far fewer deals. \n \u201cHis world seems to be Atherton, Redwood City, Palo Alto, with occasional trips to China\u201d  At his first interview with Draper, Jurvetson mentioned that he played Ultimate Frisbee. Draper hadn\u2019t heard of it, so he showed up at the next Stanford Business School game and joined. He had to be told not to tackle. For a later interview, Draper took Jurvetson to watch a pro tennis match. Draper showed up, as he often did back then, with his tie backside-front. \u201cWe\u2019re coming out of the match, and there\u2019s this two-story barricade with an aluminum handrail, and he jumps up on it and slides down like a kid,\u201d Jurvetson recalls. \u201cI said, \u2018Wow, this is the place for me.\u2019\u2009\u201d He says in all their years working together, he\u2019s never seen Draper unhappy. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him say \u2018Damn it\u2019 or [have] a burst of frustration or a down day. I don\u2019t know how he does it.\u201d Draper says his own greatest accomplishment at DFJ was the invention of viral marketing. He says he\u2019s the one who first persuaded Hotmail to put a link at the bottom of everyone\u2019s e-mail telling recipients about the free e-mail service, although he\u2019d fought hard, and lost, in his attempt for the message to read: \u201cP.S. I love you. Get your free e-mail at Hotmail.\u201d Now, detached from the firm, Draper is free to break up states and start universities. He bought an old, vacant hotel in downtown San Mateo, put a photo of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk on either side of the front doors, and opened the fully unaccredited Draper University of Heroes in June 2012, offering a six-week course for $9,600. Each morning, students\u2014mostly undergrads from abroad as well as Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley\u2014put their hands over their hearts and recite the Superhero Oath, which is also carved into a wall. It includes: I will pursue fairness, openness, health, and fun with all that I encounter. Mostly fun. I will try my best to make reparations for my digressions. My brand, my network, and my reputation are paramount. I will keep my word. For educational models, Draper says he chose Hogwarts and the X-Men\u2019s academy for mutants. Students compete throughout the session in teams with names such as Wonders, Angels, and Magic, and get points for winning events as well as really big failures. When someone pointed out the initials of Draper University of Heroes, he added \u201cD.U.H.\u201d T-shirts to the tiny school store. Students who show up late are thrown into the small hotel pool, fully clothed. A graffiti artist has spray-painted one of the oaths on an outside wall: \u201cI will promote freedom at all costs.\u201d When he built the school, Draper bought all the whiteboard paint in California, running out just before he could cover every surface of the building. In the dorm rooms upstairs, students have to write down 101 things they want to do before they die on the whiteboard walls. Sure, there\u2019s a \u201chook up with a girl in each country,\u201d but there\u2019s a whole lot of \u201ccreate something that betters lives\u201d and \u201cdisrupt education.\u201d When they graduate, the students put on a cape and jump off a springboard into the air. \u201cHaving spoken there for all of 90\xa0minutes, I got a Ph.D. at graduation,\u201d says Bill Draper. Tim Draper says his school teaches more in six weeks than Stanford does in four years. \u201cWhen I was at school, it was nothing, nothing, nothing\u2014midterms\u2014nothing, nothing, nothing\u2014finals. I realized I was capable of a lot more during that nothing period. So for these guys it\u2019s 10 to 10, all day,\u201d he says. D.U.H. is less like a university and more like a reality show. There\u2019s a class on giving a TED talk, another about brainstorming ways to make six new states work. Instead of desks and chairs and teachers, students sit on giant, colorful beanbags in the hotel lobby and listen to guest speakers. One assignment has them walk around San Francisco and get a job in four hours. They also do a lot of public speaking. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re pitching, sometimes introducing, sometimes it\u2019s mime, sometimes it\u2019s karaoke, sometimes it\u2019s just dance,\u201d Draper says. Each session, he goes with the students for their survival day in Tomales Bay, a rugged part of Marin County. He rolls up his suit leg to reveal a huge poison oak rash from the last outing. \u201cI thought I was immune, again,\u201d he says. Surbhi Sarna, a Berkeley grad and founder of nVision Medical, which produces technology for women\u2019s health issues, was confused by all the painting and go-kart racing she did as part of the first class of Draper University. But when she pitched to Draper\u2014the main reason she attended\u2014she was surprised. \u201cIt was one of my more challenging pitches. He asked tough questions. Even hardware-related stuff.\u2009\u2026\u2009He was giving us design ideas.\u201d He funded her company. About 25\xa0percent of Draper University graduates get investment from him along with a desk for three months across the street at Hero City, a huge space that used to be a furniture store. At the front, a receptionist sits at the Deskla\u2014a workspace made from a Tesla, with working headlights. Nearby is one of the world\u2019s only Bitcoin ATMs. It exchanges greenbacks for Bitcoin, which can be used to pay D.U.H. tuition. In June, U.S. Marshals auctioned off Bitcoins seized from Silk Road, the online market for illegal goods and services. Draper bought the lot for $20 million, beating out 44 other bidders. Downstairs in Hero City, on the stage of a small theater, a guy in a tuxedo-print T-shirt works with a woman wearing an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. Most of the desks are filled with young guys working at Boost, an incubator founded by Draper\u2019s son Adam, 28, that focuses on Bitcoin startups. Draper has four children in all, two boys and two girls. (Jesse and her sister did not take \u201cthe deal,\u201d either smoking or drinking before their 21st birthday.) The whole reason Draper University exists, Adam says, is because someone told his dad that you can\u2019t teach entrepreneurship. He keeps a 3D-printout of his father on his desk and seems to have nothing but admiration for his dad, despite Draper\u2019s admittedly kooky ideas, like Six Californias. \u201cIf you hear my dad talk about it in his dreamer way, you sort of believe it could happen. He\u2019s got a way of convincing people there\u2019s a way,\u201d Adam says. And even when his dad fails big, he succeeds. \u201cThis is making people talk about what is wrong with California.\u201d\xa0\xa0On July 15, Draper shows up at a Sacramento strip mall, in front of the County of Sacramento Voter Registration and Elections Department. He\u2019s wearing his Six Californias tie and standing with two young employees holding Six California signs. Political consultant Michael Arno plops four small boxes in front of Draper; they contain 83,000 signatures for Sacramento County, part of the 1.3\xa0million Arno collected for a fee of $3 each, which is very high for signatures (50\xa2 is more common), but pretty reasonable given how many people think the proposal is dumb. About a dozen reporters have gathered, and Draper shakes everyone\u2019s hand. When he greets one, the guy responds, \u201cSteve Maviglio, your nemesis. How are you?\u201d Draper looks confused, and moves on. Maviglio, a powerful Democratic consultant who was press secretary for former Governor Gray Davis, has teamed up with Joseph Rodota, a top Republican operative and former deputy chief of staff to Pete Wilson, to form OneCalifornia, to fight Draper\u2019s ballot initiative. They\u2019ve registered a political committee, are raising money, and decided on a logo of the California bear being butchered into six pieces, like a cow. \u201cHe completely lacks any practical sense of how things work. He has no sense that there\u2019s a status quo that will be impacted. He acts like there\u2019s an open field for him to stroll through,\u201d Rodota says. \u201cHis world seems to be Atherton, Redwood City, Palo Alto, with occasional trips to China.\u201d Even though Draper spent $5\xa0million and amassed enough signatures, he missed the deadline for 2014. Instead, his Six Californias initiative is on the 2016 ballot. The delay does not depress him. One of Draper\u2019s beliefs is that failures are just minor setbacks, and giant spectacular failures are actually successes, and he can use the extra time to win over voters. When Draper goes inside to drop off the boxes, the woman behind the desk asks for his driver\u2019s license, which is when he realizes he left his bag and his wallet outside on the sidewalk. He runs to get it and then signs his name as he stands next to an elderly man signing a form to run for a local election. Afterward, Draper looks around the fluorescent-lit office. \u201cThey live in the 1980s. It looks like my office did 30 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cDigital signatures would have helped me a lot. It would have saved me a fortune.\u201d Of all the insane things Draper\u2019s gotten involved in\u2014school vouchers, Schwarzenegger for governor\u2014this one\u2019s sparked the most backlash. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot about my dad over the years, but this is the first time I\u2019ve gotten upset,\u201d says his daughter Jesse. \u201cI was looking at his Facebook page the other day, and I saw some of the comments. It\u2019s just horribly mean people writing horribly mean things.\u201d Then she adds the most Draperesque interpretation possible: \u201cWhich makes me thinks he\u2019s onto something.\u201d If California doesn\u2019t get broken up or if government doesn\u2019t make some radical changes soon, Draper fears for the future. \u201cThe 99 vs. 1 is just the beginning. No one feels they\u2019re being well served by their government. The government is just able to distract them,\u201d he says. Then he peels out from this hint of rare dystopianism and returns to his role as the evangelist of fun, vowing that each new California will get to pick its own state bird. Looking around this sad office full of sad bureaucrats doing their sad paperwork, Draper stops his momentary complaining and smiles.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington Aug. 9 threw out a decision by a lower-court judge certifying the class, sending it back for him to reconsider in light of a subsequent Supreme Court ruling on class certification. The lower court also used a flawed model for determining potential harm to shippers, the panel said. \u201cMindful that the district court neither considered the damages model\u2019s flaw in its certification decision nor had the benefit\u201d of the Supreme Court case, \u201cwe will vacate class certification and remand the case to the district court to afford it an opportunity to consider these issues,\u201d U.S. Circuit Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote for the panel. The suit, brought in 2007 by Olin Corp. and seven other companies that ship goods by rail, alleges the railroad operators colluded at an industry meeting in 2003 to impose a surcharge tied to total transportation costs rather than to actual fuel prices during a 3 1/2-year period. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman last year certified a class of about 30,000 shippers in a case against Union Pacific Corp., the largest U.S. carrier by revenues; Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a unit of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the number two freight carrier; and CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. \u201cWhile this obviously was not our preferred outcome, we are gratified that the case was remanded,\u201d Stephen Neuwirth, of Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, co-lead counsel for the shippers, said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cWe are confident that we will be able to demonstrate that the damages model in fact satisfies the highest standards that have been set by the courts, and that ultimately the case will move forward as a class action.\u201d Tom Lange, a spokesman for Union Pacific, said in a statement that the company is \u201cpleased with the court\u2019s decision and looks forward to the opportunity to reaffirm that Union Pacific\u2019s fuel surcharge program complied with the applicable legal requirements.\u201d The case is In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, 12-07085, U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia (Washington).

ASIC Increases Disclosure Requirements for Dark Trading Systems The Australian Securities and Investments Commission updated disclosure requirements in an e-mailed statement, with rules that will come into force over nine months. Crossing-system operators must report to ASIC if they identify suspicious activity, and activity on their crossing system must be monitored from Nov. 10. \u201cWe expect the new rules will quickly lead to changes in the behavior of market participants, building on the positive changes we have already seen with other recent rule changes and the work of ASIC\u2019s taskforces on dark liquidity and high-frequency trading,\u201d ASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour wrote in an e-mailed statement. U.S. Said to Plan Charges Against Former JPMorgan Employees The U.S. may announce charges as early as this week against former London-based JPMorgan Chase & Co. employees related to allegations they tried to conceal losses last year, a person familiar with the matter said. The situation remains fluid and it isn\u2019t clear who may be charged, said the person, who requested anonymity because the information wasn\u2019t public. Those facing U.S. charges include Javier Martin-Artajo, a Spaniard who lives in London and a former executive who oversaw the trading strategy, and Julien Grout, a French citizen and a trader who worked for him, the New York Times reported Aug. 9. Prosecutors also are weighing penalties for the bank, including a fine and a reprimand, the newspaper said in a subsequent report. The investigation has centered on whether employees at JPMorgan\u2019s chief investment office attempted to inflate the value of trades on the bank\u2019s books by mismarking them, a person with knowledge of the matter said previously. Federal officials are considering charges related to mismarking books and falsifying documents, the person said. Edward Little, an attorney for Grout, said his client moved back to France before media reports last week about the potential charges and that he has no intention of fleeing, the New York Times reported late yesterday. The bank first disclosed losses at its London office in May 2012 after what Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called \u201cegregious mistakes\u201d in managing credit-derivative positions. The trades by Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because of the size of his holdings, eventually caused more than $6.2 billion of losses for the company. For more, click here. Juniper Falls After Disclosing Foreign Bribe Investigations Juniper Networks Inc. fell the most in more than three months after disclosing that it\u2019s being investigated for possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The shares fell 5.6 percent to $20.92 at the close on Aug. 9. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice are both conducting investigations, the Sunnyvale, California-based company disclosed in a filing Aug. 8. Juniper, the No. 2 maker of networking equipment, generated more than half of its sales outside the U.S. in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business. The company is cooperating with the investigations and \u201ccan\u2019t predict the scope or duration,\u201d said Michael Busselen, a spokesman for Juniper. John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, and Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment. In many instances, companies are investigated under the FCPA because distributors or resellers don\u2019t have strong internal controls to prevent bribery, according to Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in San Francisco. For more, click here. Obama Financial Fraud Task Force Takes On Banks Too Big to Fail The criminal investigation of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s mortgage-backed securities practice is evidence a U.S. Justice Department task force set up to investigate causes of the financial crisis is finally getting some traction against banks blamed for ruining the economy. The probe, disclosed last week in the bank\u2019s quarterly filing, is the latest enforcement effort to emerge from the Residential Mortgage Backed Securities Working Group. It was set up last year on orders of President Barack Obama to coordinate prosecutions of fraudulent underwriting activity by banks that contributed to the financial crisis. The JPMorgan probe, which is also looking at possible civil violations, grew out of the working group\u2019s efforts, said Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento, who is leading the investigation and is a member of the group\u2019s parent, the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. \u201cOver the last year and a half, the RMBS Working Group members have been aggressively investigating multiple cases across the country and the public is only beginning to see the results,\u201d Associate Attorney General Tony West, the No. 3 ranking official at the Justice Department, said in an e-mail. The JPMorgan Chase investigation, which may not lead to criminal charges, follows parallel civil lawsuits filed earlier this week by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney Office in Charlotte, North Carolina. U.S. officials claim Bank of America Corp. failed to disclose risks embedded in $850 million in mortgage-backed securities issued in 2008. The RMBS group\u2019s director is Geoff Graber, who was also the lead Justice Department lawyer in the investigation of New York-based McGraw Hill Financial Inc.\u2019s S&P unit. More than 200 federal and state attorneys, investigators and analysts have played a role in the group\u2019s work, according to the Justice Department. Graber\u2019s coordinating team, composed of eight members, is based in Washington and made up of criminal prosecutors, civil attorneys and analysts. As part of its work, it conducts day-long meetings every two months, the most recent of which occurred on July 12, according to the Justice Department. The group has faced criticism from lawmakers and consumer advocates for its failure to live up to the promises President Obama made when he announced its establishment in his January 2012 State of the Union address. The pace of the group\u2019s work drew early complaints from lawmakers. For more, click here. SAC Allowed by Judge to Keep Operating While Facing Charges SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge fund owned by Steven Cohen that is facing criminal charges and a civil money laundering lawsuit, won a judge\u2019s approval of a business plan that will allow the firm to continue operating during the cases. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan on Aug. 9 issued an order saying that federal prosecutors, who indicted the firm July 25 in an insider-trading scheme and filed a suit against the Stamford, Connecticut-based fund, will avoid interfering with SAC\u2019s legitimate operations. The approved plan requires that SAC maintain at least 85 percent of the \u201caggregate value\u201d of assets owned by the firm\u2019s \u201centity defendants\u201d as of July 1 and in exchange, allows for the fund to continue its lawful operations. If the assets fall below the specified level in a given month, the fund is required to \u201creplenish\u201d the monies, according to the order. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen & Co., declined to comment on the filing. Oregon Exchange Delay Adds to Scale-Down of Health Law Goals Oregon, a Democratic-led state that has embraced President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, won\u2019t meet all the requirements for its health-insurance exchange when the online marketplace opens Oct. 1. For at least two weeks, people using Cover Oregon won\u2019t be able to complete their purchase without help from a certified insurance broker or community group, said Lisa Morawski, an exchange spokeswoman. Consumers in all 50 states were supposed to be able to freely shop for health plans on their own. \u201cWe thought that this was an opportunity for us to open our doors on Oct. 1 with all the functionality, but not overload the system,\u201d Morawski said Aug. 9 by telephone. Oregon\u2019s step-back suggests that states don\u2019t have enough time to comply with next year\u2019s core implementation of the 2010 health law as Obama envisioned. Even the federal data services hub that is supposed to connect the exchanges may not get final security certification until Sept. 30, the inspector general for the Health and Human Services Department said April 5. \u201cWith all of the delays -- the Supreme Court delay, the election -- states and HHS for that matter simply don\u2019t have enough time to put this together as it should be,\u201d said Dan Schuyler, director of exchange technology at the consulting firm Leavitt Partners in Salt Lake City. Oregon is one of 14 states building their own exchanges. The federal government is doing most or all of the work in the remaining 36 states. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is supervising the building of state exchanges, is aware of Oregon\u2019s plan and isn\u2019t concerned, Brian Cook, an agency spokesman, said in an e-mail.

U.S. Regulator Issues Bitcoin-Related Subpoenas, WSJ Reports New York\u2019s banking regulator issued subpoenas to about two dozen companies associated with bitcoin as it looks into the virtual-currency industry, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The subpoenas, issued by the Department of Financial Services, seek information on topics including antimoney-laundering, consumer protection and investment strategies, according to the report, which didn\u2019t identify the people. The subpoenas were issued late last week, the Journal said. The department is considering setting new guidelines aimed at virtual currencies, the newspaper reported, citing a memo from Benjamin Lawsky, the agency\u2019s head. The memo, which the regulator plans to issue today, expresses concern that virtual-currency companies aren\u2019t complying with the state\u2019s money-transmission laws, according to the report. Bitcoin is a virtual currency created four years ago that can be used to buy and sell a broad array of items, from electronics to illegal narcotics. Coinsetter LLC, one of the companies cited in the report as having been issued a subpoena, said the dialogue with the regulator will have a positive effect on the industry, according to Chief Executive Officer Jaron Lukasiewicz. Lukasiewicz said there had been no misbehavior toward consumers by the leading bitcoin companies. \u201cU.S.-based Bitcoin companies are taking regulation very seriously, and each company is closely working with legal advisers to form and follow plans that adhere to it,\u201d Lukasiewicz said in an e-mail. Cantor, Ex-Trader Exchange Suits Over Alleged Blackmail Threat Cantor Fitzgerald LP accused a fired Singapore-based derivatives trader of making a blackmail threat in an exchange of lawsuits between the brokerage and its former employee over his dismissal. Gavin White, the former trader, sued in Singapore\u2019s High Court for wrongful dismissal, claiming unspecified damages. Cantor, the New York-based independent broker-dealer, countersued for a repayment of a loan and a return of a portion of his wages. A closed hearing is scheduled for Aug. 15. White, who had refused a 20 percent pay cut proposal in October, had said he might complain about alleged breaches by the brokerage in Australia, Cantor\u2019s Singapore unit said in its counterclaim. Cantor denied there had been any breaches and said it had a right to fire him for gross misconduct. White threatened to damage the firm\u2019s reputation, which amounted to a threat of blackmail, the brokerage said. \u201cMr. White strenuously denies that he made any such threat as alleged by Cantor,\u201d his lawyer Pradeep Pillai said in a phone interview. \u201cHe is eager to have his name cleared of the allegation of gross misconduct.\u201d In addition to denying having made the statements attributed to him, White said that any comments he made in October meetings to discuss his pay with his supervisor weren\u2019t supposed to be used against him. Cantor breached a three-year employment contract by firing him in November, he said in the complaint. Cantor proposed to cut White\u2019s pay in October because his division was underperforming and the brokerage couldn\u2019t sustain the \u201cextremely high salaries\u201d on the team, the firm said in court papers. White was paid S$580,000 ($461,000) a year at Cantor. Cantor is seeking the return of S$297,576. Robert Hubbell, a spokesman for Cantor, declined to comment on the litigation. The case is White v. Cantor Fitzgerald (Singapore) Capital Markets Ltd. S139/2013. Singapore High Court. UBS Agrees to Pay $120 Million to Settle Lehman Suit Claims UBS AG, Switzerland\u2019s largest bank, agreed to pay $120 million to settle claims by investors in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. securities in a lawsuit tied to the investment bank\u2019s 2008 collapse. UBS was accused of violating federal securities laws in underwriting and selling the securities to investors, who claimed that offering materials contained misleading information about Lehman Brothers\u2019 financial condition. \u201cUBS is pleased to have resolved this legacy litigation matter arising out of the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d the Zurich-based lender said in a statement. \u201cUBS agreed to the settlement to avoid the cost and uncertainty of continued litigation.\u201d The settlement, disclosed Aug. 8 in a filing in federal court in New York, compares \u201cfavorably\u201d with other recoveries stemming from the credit crisis, the plaintiffs said. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. The settlement, which requires court approval, represents a recovery of 13.4 percent of the total face value of securities at issue, or about $896 million, without taking into account UBS\u2019s defenses and rights of offset, according to the court filing. The case is In re Lehman Brothers Securities and Erisa Litigation, 09-md-02017, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). N.Y. Federal Reserve Bomb Plotter Sentenced to 30 Years A Bangladeshi man who tried to detonate what he thought was a 1,000-pound bomb at the New York Federal Reserve was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, 22, who was drawn into an undercover operation, was arrested in October after repeatedly attempting to set off fake explosives provided to him by federal agents. He pleaded guilty in February and on Aug. 9 was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon in Brooklyn, New York, for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. \u201cI am persuaded that the defendant was a serious threat to the safety of New Yorkers, of Americans,\u201d Amon said during a hearing, imposing a sentence that was at the lower end of a recommended range of as much as life in prison. On the day of his attempted bombing, while covering his face, wearing sunglasses and disguising his voice, Nafis had a federal agent posing as a co-conspirator record a video statement he made, saying \u201cWe will not stop until we attain victory or martyrdom,\u201d according to a criminal complaint. In the courtroom Aug. 9, Nafis, clean-shaven and wearing an over-sized khaki jail uniform, said he was grateful to the agents who caught him. He asked the judge to \u201cplease have mercy on me.\u201d The U.S. alleged that Nafis came to the U.S. in January 2012 with the intention of carrying out a terrorist attack. After a brief period at Southeast Missouri State University, he went to New York and tried to recruit others for his plot, prosecutors alleged. His lawyer, Heidi Cesare, said Nafis has taken responsibility for his actions and is unlikely to pose a future threat. The case is U.S. v. Nafis, 1:12-cr-00720, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). For more, click here. Harbinger Sues Deere, Garmin Over Spectrum for GPS Products Hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners sued Deere & Co., Garmin International Inc. and Trimble Navigation Ltd. claiming they concealed facts about global positioning satellite products that ruined Harbinger\u2019s investment in a wireless communications business. The companies are accused of failing to disclose that Harbinger\u2019s venture, LightSquared, would interfere with their products, according to a complaint filed Aug. 9 in federal court in Manhattan. Harbinger is seeking damages of at least $1.9 billion. \u201cPlaintiffs have already lost a great deal and now stand to lose their entire investment,\u201d Harbinger said. \u201cPlaintiffs never would have made this investment if the defendants had told the truth earlier.\u201d LightSquared filed for bankruptcy in 2012. U.S. regulators blocked the service after GPS-device makers and users -- including the U.S. military and commercial airlines -- said signals from LightSquared\u2019s service would confound navigation gear.

Now Starbucks Corp. is trying a similar feat with its loyalty program. The coffee chain has forged deals with music service Spotify Ltd., the New York Times and ride-sharing company Lyft Inc. -- all of which will let customers earn points toward free drinks and food at their local Starbucks. The program doles out \u201cStars\u201d when users make purchases, creating a form of currency that works with Starbucks\u2019 mobile app or loyalty cards. The company credited the effort with helping drive a 4 percent gain in customer traffic last quarter. The challenge now is building out the Stars network beyond the first few partners. Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz says the company is seeking out businesses in a range of industries that could work with the program, aiming to prod customers into visiting Starbucks more often. \u201cWhen fueled by partners, it drives people in the store that they might not have gotten otherwise,\u201d said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. Starbucks currently has 10.4 million active loyalty-program members, up 28 percent from a year earlier, Schultz said on a conference call Thursday. The effort has gotten a boost from more customers using their phones to pay for their Starbucks orders. In the U.S., mobile payments now represent a fifth of all in-store transactions, more than double the level two years ago. New Bitcoin? The program also is a step toward a future where Starbucks Stars are collected in a manner akin to airline miles, bitcoin, gift cards and gold. As part of their partnership with Starbucks, Spotify, the Times and Lyft all purchased a number of Stars themselves. The idea is to use them to reward customers when they sign up for subscriptions or buy rides. \u201cThat\u2019s something very close to being like a currency,\u201d said James Wester, research director for IDC Financial Insights. Future Stars partners could include companies like Staples Inc., Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Netflix Inc., according to analysts. Schultz said on Thursday that future participants may be named in the coming quarters. \u201cWe have identified prospective partners in multiple attractive business verticals,\u201d he said. If the Stars platform can build enough support, it could become currency for digital goods, said Chetan Sharma, an independent analyst for the wireless industry. That means customers could use the points to pay for songs, videos and online games. Loyalty programs tied to smartphone apps are on the rise. In June, Apple Inc. said it will be adding support for rewards programs with its iOS 9 mobile software, coming in the fall. Google Inc., meanwhile, has integrated merchants\u2019 loyalty programs into its mobile-payment service, Android Pay. That means loyalty points are automatically used at checkout. In May, a coalition that includes AT&T Inc., Macy\u2019s Inc., Rite Aid Corp. and Hulu LLC introduced Plenti, a loyalty program operated by American Express Co. It offers members multiple ways to earn Plenti loyalty points, which are redeemable at any participating retailer. Uber Technologies Inc., a Lyft competitor, also inked a deal with American Express, letting its customers earn points toward future rides. An average American household participates in 29 loyalty programs, but is active in just 12 of them, according to Colloquy research. The number of loyalty-program memberships rose 26 percent since 2013, the firm said in February. The trick for Starbucks will be to choose the right partners, and not cheapen its rewards, said Thad Peterson, a senior analyst at Aite Group. \u201cThe biggest risk to a program such as this is dilution of value,\u201d he said.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-24/starbucks-attempts-to-create-a-caffeine-based-currency', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 7, 24, 15, 21, 16, 249000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Starbucks Attempts to Create a Caffeine-Based Currency'}, {'articleText': u'  A 64-year-old physicist, identified by Newsweek magazine as Bitcoin\u2019s creator, was chased by reporters through Los Angeles and denied any role in the digital currency, saying he first heard of it three weeks ago. Hours after Newsweek published a profile of Dorian S. Nakamoto, the former defense industry and government employee emerged from his home in a Temple City neighborhood, briefly telling journalists \u201cI\u2019m not involved in Bitcoin.\u201d The group trailed him in a multivehicle car chase yesterday as he fled to an Associated Press bureau. The AP later wrote that he insisted during a two-hour interview that he first heard of Bitcoin when a reporter contacted his son last month. Journalists, bloggers and others have sought for years to identify the mysterious computer coder who wrote a paper on Bitcoin\u2019s framework and created the software that serves as its backbone. The initial document carried the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, and since the author or authors otherwise chose to remain private and anonymous, it had been widely assumed the name was a pseudonym. Publications such as the New Yorker have attempted to solve the mystery, examining possible Bitcoin founders that included a former cryptography student, a former programmer and economists. The Nakamoto living in Temple City used to be named Satoshi and adopted the first name Dorian in 1973, Newsweek reported in its cover story. He was born in Japan, attended California State Polytechnic University, worked for defense contractors on classified military projects and eventually the Federal Aviation Administration, the magazine wrote. According to Newsweek reporter Leah McGrath Goodman, when Dorian Nakamoto was confronted at his home before publication and asked about Bitcoin, he responded, \u201cI am no longer involved in that and cannot discuss it. It\u2019s been turned over to other people.\u201d He told the AP that he was misunderstood. \u201cIt sounded like I was involved before with Bitcoin and looked like I\u2019m not involved now,\u201d it quoted him as saying. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I want to clarify that.\u201d Newsweek magazine defended Goodman\u2019s reporting. \u201cMs. Goodman\u2019s research was conducted under the same high editorial and ethical standards that have guided Newsweek for more than 80 years,\u201d the magazine said on its website today. \u201cNewsweek stands strongly behind Ms. Goodman and her article.\u201d Emerging from his home after the article was published, Dorian Nakamoto told reporters he would go to lunch with one of them. He picked an AP reporter, and they got in a blue Toyota Prius and headed for Mako Sushi in nearby Arcadia. Other reporters drove after them, and as Nakamoto saw he wasn\u2019t going to be left alone at the restaurant, he bolted again. He and the reporter got back into the car and headed to the AP bureau in downtown Los Angeles. By mid-afternoon, a gaggle of non-AP reporters were standing outside the office waiting for him to come out. The episode followed a day in which Bitcoin enthusiasts reacted to Newsweek\u2019s article with a mixture of resignation and disbelief, with some debating Dorian Nakamoto\u2019s possible role or whether he should have been left alone. \u201cFascinating,\u201d Martti Malmi, a Finnish programmer who worked with Nakamoto on the Bitcoin code, wrote on Twitter. \u201cSatoshi seems not much different than how I imagined him.\u201d Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation who had been one of the few people to communicate with Satoshi Nakamoto, didn\u2019t immediately indicate whether he could identify Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin\u2019s creator. Andresen said in a message on Twitter that he regrets talking to the magazine about Nakamoto. He said he was disappointed that Newsweek decided to \u201cdox,\u201d or document, the Nakamoto family. Satoshi Nakamoto has been thought to be a pseudonym for a programmer or group of programmers who wrote the paper and the initial source code for Bitcoin. The code has since been handed off to a loose group of experts affiliated with the foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group. The paper, first published in 2008, offered a proof of the basic concept of Bitcoin, which uses a public ledger and a network of voluntary computers, known as \u201cminers,\u201d to validate transactions that are signed with encrypted signatures. After the initial source code created the first batches of Bitcoin, it grew from an obsession of specialists into a global phenomenon. Merchants around the world now accept Bitcoin for everything from kitchen appliances on Overstock.com to luxury goods listed on BitPremier, a website. It also trades for traditional currencies, and was priced at $651.14 at 4 p.m. Hong Kong time today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Bitcoin attracted media attention last week when Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the biggest exchange for the digital currency, filed for bankruptcy protection after coins valued at more than $500 million went missing. Following lawmaker calls for regulation, Japan\u2019s government said today that Bitcoin isn\u2019t a currency. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts said they were skeptical that Newsweek had found the right person. Others said they were furious that the news media would try to violate his privacy. \u201cI would have thought every Satoshi Nakamoto on planet Earth had already been contacted and ruled out,\u201d Stephen Pair, the chief technical officer at Atlanta-based BitPay, a payment processor. \u201cIf this person is the real Satoshi, it would be easy to for him to prove it if he wanted to.\u201d Jeff Garzik, one of the core developers on the Bitcoin software protocol and an employee of BitPay, said \u201cthe \u2018real\u2019 Satoshi\u201d can prove his identity only through cryptography. \u201cWe will know Satoshi by his digital signatures,\u201d Garzik said in an e-mail, adding that the founder could either sign a message using his unique encryption key or make use of the Bitcoins that the creator is known to have kept. Analysts who looked at the Bitcoin ledger have concluded that the creator of the system owns about 1 million coins, worth over $600 million at current prices, said Jered Kenna, a San Francisco Bitcoin investor. If the owner pledged never to sell or trade them, it would help add stability to what has been a volatile market, Kenna said. Adam Draper, the chief executive officer of Boost, a San Mateo, California, company that incubates Bitcoin startups, called the Newsweek article \u201cintrusive\u201d and said he\u2019s unconvinced. \u201cIf Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to be anonymous the whole time, why would he use his real name on the paper?\u201d Draper said. \u201cHe always used non-tracking e-mails and did everything he could to stay anonymous, so it\u2019s difficult for me to understand why he would use his real name.\u201d Identifying Bitcoin\u2019s founder won\u2019t affect the current network, said Gregory Maxwell, one of the core developers on the project.

Supported by the Securities Investor Protection Corp.,\nMadoff trustee Irving Picard filed papers with the high court in\nOctober asking permission to appeal a June ruling by the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals in New York that said the trustee is tainted by\nMadoff\u2019s fraud and therefore barred from suing banks that\nenabled theft.  Justices of the Supreme Court will hold a conference on\nJan. 10 to decide on allowing an appeal. If they take the case,\nthe announcement may come that day.  If there is no announcement on Jan. 10, the justices might\nsay on Jan. 13 that they won\u2019t allow another appeal. Or, they\ncould delay making a decision and request the views of the U.S.\nSolicitor General, the arm of the Justice Department that\nappears for the government in the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court by tradition doesn\u2019t say why it decides\nto hear a case, instead only laying out the issues to be argued.\nEven if the high court allows an appeal, the justices probably\nwon\u2019t say whether they were persuaded by news this month that\nJPMorgan tentatively agreed to pay about $2 billion to settle a\ncriminal investigation into whether the bank turned a blind eye\nto the Ponzi scheme.  As trustee for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities\nInc., Picard seeks to revive his lawsuits seeking $30.6 billion\nfrom the banks. Unless the Supreme Court sets aside the New York\ncourt\u2019s ruling, Picard is unlikely to pay off the entire $17.3\nbillion in claims resulting from Madoff\u2019s fraud. So far, he has\nmade recoveries equaling about 54 percent of their claims,\ncalculated as the difference between what customers invested and\nwhat they withdrew.  Opposing Supreme Court review in papers filed last week,\nthe banks said Picard is bringing up an \u201carcane question\u201d\nwhere there is no disagreement among the federal circuit courts\nof appeal. They see the case as having been decided by the\nSupreme Court in a 1972 opinion called Caplin v. Marine Midland\nGrace Trust Co.  The banks interpret Caplin as meaning that a bankruptcy\ntrustee cannot assert claims belonging to individual creditors.  This week, Picard filed his last set of papers, explaining\nhow federal appeals courts are split on two distinct questions.\nHe argued that several appeals courts interpret Caplin to mean\nthat a bankruptcy trustee can sue when a claim is common to all\ncreditors, not just a few.  Other banks that got Picard\u2019s cases dismissed include HSBC\nHoldings Plc, UBS AG and UniCredit SpA.

For\ndetails on papers filed by SIPC, click here for the Nov. 11\nBloomberg bankruptcy report.  If the Supreme Court allows the Madoff appeal, there will\nbe four bankruptcy cases in the term that began in October. On\nJan. 13, the court will hear Law v. Siegel and decide whether\nbankruptcy courts have general equity power to take otherwise\nexempt property away from individual bankrupts.  On Jan. 14, the high court will hear arguments in Executive\nBenefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison, a case to decide whether\nsomeone can waive the constitutional right for some bankruptcy\nlawsuits to be finally decided in district court.  In November, the high court agreed to hear Clark v. Rameker\nto decide if an inherited individual retirement account is an\nexempt asset a person can retain even in bankruptcy.  The Madoff firm began liquidating in December 2008 with the\nappointment of Picard as trustee under the Securities Investor\nProtection Act.  Madoff individually went into an involuntary Chapter 7\nliquidation in April 2009, and his case was later consolidated\nwith the investment firm\u2019s liquidation.

MSR Hotels & Resorts Inc., a real-estate investment trust\ncontrolled by Paulson & Co., will hold a confirmation hearing on\nFeb. 6 for approval of a Chapter 11 plan, just after the Jan. 30\nauction to locate the best bid for trademarks not included in\naffiliates\u2019 sales in their already-completed bankruptcies.  Last week, the bankruptcy judge in New York approved\ndisclosure materials explaining the plan. In October, the judge\nset up the auction procedures.  Initiated in May, the MSR Hotels Chapter 11 filing was\ndesigned to stop a lawsuit filed by Five Mile Capital Partners\nLLC and sell trademarks for the Grand Wailea Resort Hotel and\nSpa in Hawaii, the La Quinta Resort and Club in La Quinta,\nCalifornia, and the Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa in Phoenix.  MSR Hotels was an indirect owner of the three hotels, which\nwere among the five properties owned by Paulson and Winthrop\nRealty Trust that were acquired in February through consummation\nof a Chapter 11 reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in\nNew York. The properties were purchased by secured lender\nGovernment of Singapore Investment Corp. Singapore is the\nlogical buyer for the trademarks, according to the hotel REIT.  By approving the affiliates\u2019 plan, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge\nSean H. Lane overruled objections by Five Mile. The new\nbankruptcy resulted from a lawsuit Five Mile filed in New York\nState court in April against MSR Hotels and its officers from\nPaulson. MSR Hotels characterized Five Mile as an \u201cout of the\nmoney\u201d lender to the five resorts.  The Five Mile suit, transferred to federal court, blocked\nthe ability to sell the marks outside of bankruptcy. Lane later\ndismissed the Five Mile suit.  The disclosure statements shows secured lender Midland Loan\nServices Inc., owed $59.9 million, as recovering 7 percent.  Five Mile filed a $61.3 million claim which the judge\nknocked out, according to the disclosure statement.  MSR Hotels originally listed assets of $785,000 and\nliabilities totaling $59.2 million. Debt at that time included\n$59.1 million owing to Midland, a secured creditor in the five\nresorts\u2019 bankruptcy. Midland has a lien on the three resorts\u2019\ntrademarks.  Other than the trademarks, MSR Hotels\u2019 other assets were\nlisted as being $150,000 in unrestricted cash. The company has\nno operations. Revenue in 2012 was $32,500, according to a court\nfiling.  In the bankruptcy of the five resorts, one was sold. The\nremaining four went to the Singapore fund under the Chapter 11\nplan for $1.5 billion, consisting of $1.12 billion in cash and\n$360 million in debt. For details on the sale and the\naccompanying Chapter 11 plan, click here for the Aug. 20, 2012,\nBloomberg bankruptcy report.  Paulson and Winthrop acquired the five resorts through\nforeclosure in early 2011. The other two are the Claremont\nResort & Spa in Berkeley, California, and the Doral Golf Resort\nand Spa in Miami. Donald Trump bought the Doral property last\nyear.  Paulson and Winthrop put all five into Chapter 11 in\nFebruary 2011 to halt foreclosure of $1 billion in mortgages and\n$525 million in maturing mezzanine debt.  The five properties in their prior bankruptcy listed assets\nof $2.2 billion and liabilities of $1.9 billion. An affiliate of\nMorgan Stanley purchased the five resorts in 2007 for $4\nbillion.

The new plan is supported by Philip Falcone\u2019s Harbinger\nCapital Partners LLC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Fortress Investment\nGroup LLC and Melody Capital Advisors LLC.  The revised plan calls for paying most creditors in full to\navoid having the business taken over under a competing plan\nwhere Charles Ergen\u2019s Dish Network Corp. would buy LightSquared\nfor $2.2 billion.  The new LightSquared plan is financed with a $2.5 billion\nsecured exit loan, a $250 million senior secured loan and $1.25\nbillion in new equity.

Beechcraft Corp., the aircraft maker that emerged from\nbankruptcy reorganization in February, is to be acquired for\n$1.4 billion by Textron Inc.  The sale is to be completed in the first half of 2014,\naccording to a statement yesterday.

Lone Pine Resources Inc., an oil and gas exploration and\nproduction company, filed papers this week designed so a U.S.\nbankruptcy court can hold a hearing on Jan. 16 to enable U.S.\nenforcement of a reorganization plan scheduled for approval in a\nCanadian court on Jan. 9.  Calgary-based Lone Pine filed a Chapter 15 petition in\nSeptember for the U.S. court to assist the Canadian court in the\ncompany\u2019s bankruptcy reorganization under Canada\u2019s Companies\u2019\nCreditors Arrangement Act. In October, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court\nin Delaware ruled that Canada is home to the so-called foreign\nmain proceeding.  Lone Pine filed its workout plan this month in the Canadian\ncourt. It was negotiated before the bankruptcy filings with\nholders of 75 percent of the $195 million in senior notes.\nCreditors will meet to approve the plan on Jan. 6, before the\npivotal hearing three days later in the Canadian court.  Assuming no snags, noteholders will receive 100 percent\nownership of the new common stock. The existing $180 million\nsecured bank credit will be paid in full with proceeds from a\nnew asset-backed loan.  The reorganized company is to be additionally financed with\n$100 million in preferred stock to be purchased by some of the\nnoteholders. The preferred stock would be convertible into 75\npercent of the common equity.  General unsecured creditors will share a $700,000 fund.  Lone Pine defaulted on the senior notes by missing a\npayment in August.  The 10.375 percent senior unsecured notes traded at 12:50\np.m. yesterday for 34 cents on the dollar, according to Trace,\nthe bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority. The notes sold for 85 cents on June 3 and\nfetched almost 65 cents in the first trades after bankruptcy.  Chapter 15 isn\u2019t a full-blown corporate reorganization like\nChapter 11. The finding that Canada has the foreign main\nbankruptcy automatically halts creditor actions in the U.S. and\nenables the court in Delaware to assure compliance with the\nreorganization in the U.S.  Lone Pine had an initial public stock offering at $13 a\nshare in May 2011, raising $195 million. The stock lost 3.5\npercent in the first day\u2019s trading and never surpassed the\noffering price.  The case is In re Lone Pine Resources Inc., 13-bk-12487,\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia answered a\ndifficult preference question without focusing on the language\nof Section 547, the provision in the Bankruptcy Code governing\npreferences.  Instead, the circuit court took what it called a \u201cbroader\napproach\u201d by considering the \u201ccontext of the Bankruptcy Code\nas a whole.\u201d  The case involved a creditor that provided temporary\nstaffing. Within 90 days of the customer\u2019s bankruptcy, the\ncreditor received an $82,000 payment that otherwise would have\nbeen a preference.  After receipt of the preference, and before bankruptcy, the\ncreditor extended another $101,000 in credit that was\noutstanding on the date of the bankruptcy filing.  While in Chapter 11, the bankrupt company received court\napproval to pay pre-bankruptcy wages. The creditor therefore\nreceived $72,500.  The bankruptcy trustee argued that the post-bankruptcy\npayment of $72,500 should be deducted from the so-called new-value defense, leaving the creditor liable for a $53,700\npreference.  The creditor argued the $72,500 payment should be\ndisregarded, allowing the new-value defense to offset the\npreference entirely.  Writing for the Third Circuit appeals court in\nPhiladelphia, Circuit Judge Marjorie O. Rendell said the case\nwas one of \u201cfirst impression,\u201d with no decisions from circuit\ncourts. District and bankruptcy courts are almost evenly\ndivided, she said.  She rejected a \u201cplain meaning\u201d analysis of the question,\nbased on the trustee\u2019s argument that the statute doesn\u2019t contain\na cutoff date for payments taken into consideration in a\npreference analysis. Just because courts have reached different\nconclusions on a statute doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ambiguous, she said.  Looking to the preference provision in the \u201ccontext\u201d of\nthe \u201cBankruptcy Code as a whole,\u201d Rendell concluded that the\npost-bankruptcy payment doesn\u2019t reduce the new-value defense.  Section 547 on preferences deals with payments in the 90-day period before bankruptcy, not after, Rendell said. She also\nnoted in her 34-page opinion that the statute of limitations for\ninitiating a preference suit begins to run on the filing date.  If the court were to consider post-bankruptcy payments, it\nwould also be logical to include post-bankruptcy extensions of\ncredit, she said.  Rendell also looked to the purpose of the preference\nstatute and said, among other things, that it\u2019s intended to\nencourage creditors to continue dealing with companies in\nfinancial distress.

The accord depends on a Japanese bankruptcy court\u2019s approval, according to papers filed in federal court in Chicago. The settlement wouldn\u2019t release Mt. Gox principal Mark Karpeles from potential liability. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan on Feb. 28 after disclosing it couldn\u2019t account for about 850,000 units of the virtual currency, including more than 700,000 belonging to its customers. Bitcoins are worth $436.35 a piece today according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price index. While Mt. Gox later announced some 200,000 coins had been located, depositor losses still exceeded $218 million. U.S. depositor Gregory Greene of Illinois sued the company\u2019s American affiliate, along with Karpeles and a company controlled by him, on behalf of U.S. depositors almost at the same time Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan. Joined by Californian depositor Joseph Lack in a revised complaint, the men added claims against minority Mt. Gox owner Jed McCaleb, company executive Gonzague Gay-Bouchery and Japan\u2019s Mizuho Bank Ltd., which handled transactions for the exchange. Under the accord proposed yesterday, a group of outside investors calling themselves Sunlot Holdings Inc., would acquire the bankrupt company, restart it, distribute the 200,000 recovered bitcoins to depositors on a pro-rata basis and give members of the old exchange a 16.5 percent interest in the new one. Sunlot said in a statement that 127,000 customers would receive payment. Sunlot and the settling customers would also gain the cooperation of Gay-Bouchery and McCaleb in the pursuit of claims against the non-settling defendants including the bank and Karpeles, according to the filing, and recover missing currency. A parallel settlement is being proposed in a case filed in Canada. \u201cThe settlements and reorganization plan, if first approved by this court and then the Japanese bankruptcy court, have the potential of more than fully compensating the class, as well as the other exchange members who don\u2019t fall within the class, for their losses that resulted from the fall of Mt.

They filed notices of their appeals on May 2013, and on\nJune 26, the appeals court said the government presented enough\nevidence to warrant the convictions and rejected the defendants\u2019\nclaims of misconduct by the prosecutors.

A partial auction for 29,656 bitcoins will be held this month, the U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement yesterday. A total of about 144,341 bitcoins, worth about $86 million at current prices, was transferred to the agency from the FBI, the authorities said. The hoard for sale represents part of the bitcoins seized in October when Silk Road\u2019s operator, Ross William Ulbricht, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit computer hacking and conspiracy to launder money. The website was a \u201csprawling black-market bazaar\u201d used by drug dealers and other vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and launder hundreds of millions of dollars derived from the illicit transactions, the U.S. said. The value of bitcoins declined 6.7 percent yesterday to $586 apiece, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which represents an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. The auction is scheduled to start on June 27 at 6 a.m. Bidders will have to register in advance, furnish proof of identity and deposit $200,000 in cash with the U.S. Department of Justice. The winner or winners will be announced on June 30. Linzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals, said the rest of the bitcoins may be sold at a later date. \u201cThose other bitcoins are in a wallet controlled by the Marshals,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cThey are subject to an interlocutory sale order and may be sold pursuant to a court order at a later date.\u201d Bitcoins, proposed in 2008 by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, is a software protocol for issuing and moving money across the Internet. While bitcoins can be used to buy and sell goods and services on the Web and in shops, they\u2019re not in widespread use. By auctioning bitcoins instead of keeping them as digital money, the U.S. government is effectively treating them as a seized asset, such as gold or property. Bitcoin captured the attention of technologists, investors and governments last year, fueling a rally that drove it to a record of about $1,200 from $12. Scrutiny from regulators, bans in China and India and stumbles by merchants and service providers have fueled volatility and a decline in their value. The U.S. seized about 173,991 bitcoins during the investigation, according to Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The amount being prepared for auction corresponds to the number that was recovered from servers used to run the Silk Road site. The rest of the total involved bitcoins stored on computer hardware belonging to Ulbricht. On Jan. 15, the bitcoins recovered from Silk Road servers were ordered forfeited in a civil action filed by the U.S. which seeks all of Silk Road\u2019s assets.

For example, an exchange based in Tokyo went bankrupt in February after losing most of its users\u2019 accounts to hackers. \u201cThus far, interagency efforts have had a law enforcement focus, reflecting the attractiveness of virtual currencies to those who may want to launder money or purchase black market items,\u201d the GAO said in the May report that was posted yesterday after Bloomberg News wrote about its findings. Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who held the first hearings on Bitcoin last year, sought the report to clarify what the U.S. government is doing to build a legal framework for digital currencies that cross regulatory boundaries. Bitcoin, for example, can be used like money even while it resembles a commodity, and can function like a payment system. \u201cGAO\u2019s report underscores the importance that all sectors -- law enforcement, industry, relevant regulators, and consumer protection agencies -- must come to the table and engage in meaningful dialogue to provide clear rules of the road for entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers alike,\u201d Carper said in an e-mailed statement.

The technology can be tweaked to record changes in ownership of any asset in a public ledger using a distributed network of computers, and could help facilitate transactions at businesses like carriers, banks, stock exchanges or insurance providers. The bitcoin blockchain technology, as it is called, could be used to cheaply transfer money between different countries, Nahon said. Like other carriers, Orange is building up its mobile-payment business as more people use their smartphones to make purchases or transfers. Orange already has more than 12 million users for its money transfer service Orange Money in Africa and the Middle East, and is looking to expand the business. Orange Silicon Valley has been holding bitcoin events at its offices in San Francisco and is talking to two bitcoin companies, Nahon said. The group can invest $20,000 per startup and is part of global team that can spend up to 3 million euros ($3.2 million) per company. The carrier recently expanded its venture-capital effort with the creation of Orange Digital Ventures. The goal is to have supported 500 startups worldwide by 2020, Orange said in March. \u201cEven though we have a large internal R&D organization, given the pace of innovation we need to compliment our own initiatives and projects with what the outside world is doing,\u201d Nahon said. Bitcoin venture-capital investments hit an all-time quarterly high of $233.95 million in the first quarter, according to researcher CB Insights. Google Ventures and venture arms of several other large tech companies have made investments in bitcoin-related startups. Even the biggest U.S. stock exchange operators are taking steps to embrace bitcoin.

He built it. He grew it. He operated it from top to bottom.\u201d The government claims Ulbricht, 30, started Silk Road in 2011 and ran it until his arrest in 2013. In that time more than 100,000 site users paid $213 million in bitcoins to buy drugs and other illegal items anonymously from vendors located around the globe, Turner said. Turner argued that the U.S. presented the jury with a wealth of evidence tying Ulbricht, the neatly dressed, former Eagle Scout at the defense table, to Dread Pirate Roberts, the online identity of a website operator who alternated between fixing server glitches and ordering murders as he ran the most infamous drug site on the so-called dark net. Ulbricht faces as long as life in prison if convicted. Jurors will begin considering the case Wednesday. \u201cThe Internet is not what it seems,\u201d Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Dratel, told the jury of six women and six men in his closing argument. \u201cDPR and Mr. Ulbricht cannot be the same person.\u201d He has said Ulbricht started Silk Road as an \u201ceconomic experiment\u201d and passed the site to others within a few months. Dratel also claimed Ulbricht was set up as a \u201cfall guy\u201d by Mark Karpeles, the former head of the bankrupt Mt. Gox Co. bitcoin exchange. Dratel claimed Karpeles was the true mastermind behind Silk Road. Karpeles, who lives in Japan, has denied involvement with Silk Road. He hasn\u2019t been charged. Much of the government\u2019s evidence was recovered from the silver Samsung 700Z laptop computer that Ulbricht was using when he was arrested. Jurors heard testimony that Ulbricht was logged in as Dread Pirate Roberts and communicating with a U.S. agent working as an undercover Silk Road employee at the moment of his arrest, in a San Francisco library near his home. Prosecutors showed the jury files taken from the laptop, including Silk Road maintenance logs, to-do lists, weekly reports, accounting entries and a computer journal detailing the beginnings and growth of Silk Road. Turner also told jurors that Ulbricht tried to order the killing of five people who threatened Silk Road\u2019s security. Both sides agreed no murders were actually carried out. \u201cThank goodness that this man\u2019s power trip was stopped before he managed to connect with a real hit man,\u201d Turner said. Turner said Ulbricht used the name \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d taken from a series of pirate captains who passed the title from one to another in the film \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d to deflect suspicion from him. \u201cIt\u2019s a con,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bogus cover story to indicate to people there\u2019s some kind of rotating command of the site.\u201d In addition to the computer evidence, prosecutors presented testimony of a friend of Ulbricht who said he helped him with programming on the site in 2011. Richard Bates testified that Ulbricht told him he created and ran Silk Road. In the defense closing, Dratel argued that the government\u2019s evidence was planted on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop by the real DPR. He said Ulbricht was \u201clured back in\u201d to work on Silk Road, shortly before his arrest, to make him look guilty. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of blinking neon keys that have been created in this case to implicate Mr. Ulbricht,\u201d Dratel said. Dratel frequently contrasted his client\u2019s failure to use online security practices with the behavior of Silk Road\u2019s anonymity-obsessed DPR, even at a time when DPR was aware the government was investigating Silk Road. He pointed to the extensive online chats the prosecution showed jurors during the trial. \u201cSaving those chats. Does that sound like DPR?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too convenient.\u201d Dratel said the value of bitcoins rose from $100 to $1,000 after Ulbricht\u2019s arrest, benefiting Karpeles. He said the government was under pressure to make an arrest in the Silk Road case and rushed to charge the wrong person. Dratel told jurors it\u2019s impossible to determine the real identities of the people behind the thousands of Silk Road user IDs. He said it would have been easy for someone controlling Ulbricht\u2019s computer to add details to web chats and other documents falsely implicating him as DPR. \u201cThe kind of evidence we\u2019ve seen here cannot be trusted beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d he said. Dratel cited the testimony by Bates, the computer programmer, that Ulbricht told him in November 2011 that he had sold Silk Road. Dratel also pointed to testimony of several character witnesses who testified about Ulbricht\u2019s \u201creputation for peacefulness and non-violence.\u201d Ulbricht couldn\u2019t have ordered murders, he said.

When Japan\u2019s Mt.

Eric Eoin Marques, an Irish-American who the FBI calls the \u201clargest facilitator of child pornography online,\u201d has been in a Dublin jail since August 2013, fighting extradition to the U.S. on charges related to child porn. Police say Marques provided Web hosting to numerous child porn websites, and on the same server he also ran a bitcoin exchange. Efforts to contact Marques\u2019 attorney were unsuccessful, and the FBI and court officials in Ireland and the U.S. declined to comment on the case. In an interview with the Irish Independent newspaper last year, Marques\u2019 father said his son was simply an operator of a Web hosting company and was innocent of the child porn charges. Unlike credit cards, which are linked to a specific person, bitcoins typically shield the identity of their owners. In most cases, it takes nothing more than an e-mail address to create an account, and only a handful of countries regulate the currency.

Shaun Bridges, who worked for the U.S. Secret Service as a computer forensics expert, was part of a Baltimore task force whose investigation led to murder-for-hire and drug charges there against Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, known online as Dread Pirate Roberts. He was separately convicted by a jury in New York and sentenced in May to life in prison for running a $214 million criminal enterprise that catered to hackers and drug traffickers. Bridges allegedly stole $820,000 in bitcoins that he got control of during the probe. He agreed to plead guilty to money laundering and obstruction of justice, according to a filing Wednesday in San Francisco federal court. \u201cMr. Bridges has regretted his actions from the very beginning,\u201d Steve Hale Levin, a lawyer for Bridges, said in a phone interview. \u201cHis decision to plead guilty reflects his complete acceptance of responsibility and is another step towards rehabilitation.\u201d Bridges arrested a Silk Road customer support representative and, using passwords he learned from the arrest, moved bitcoin from Silk Road accounts into his own, according to prosecutors. Bridges moved the stolen bitcoin into an account at Mt. Gox, a digital currency exchange based in Japan, and then converted the online currency into U.S. dollars and transferred it at least two more times, eventually to a bank account, prosecutors said. Carl Force, the lead undercover agent on the investigation in Baltimore who worked for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, is accused of creating fictitious identities, including \u201cFrench Maid,\u201d to extort and negotiate with Ulbricht. After extorting Ulbricht, Force wired about $235,000 to an account in Panama to hide it, according to the criminal complaint disclosed in March.

Carl Force, 46, threatened to provide information about Ulbricht to the government and also offered to sell Ulbricht information about the U.S. investigation, prosecutors said Monday. A second agent, Shaun Bridges, 32, who worked for the U.S. Secret Service as a computer forensics expert, allegedly stole $820,000 in bitcoins that he got control of during the investigation. Prosecutors said in court filings for Ulbricht\u2019s trial that they had evidence he tried to arrange the murder of five people who threatened the anonymity of buyers and sellers on Silk Road. \u201cThe government\u2019s considerable efforts at keeping this monumental scandal from being aired at Ross Ulbricht\u2019s trial is itself scandalous,\u201d Lindsay Lewis, one of his lawyers, said Monday in an e-mail. The charges revealed Monday show that the investigation of Ulbricht lacked integrity and was fatally compromised, she said. \u201cThe government improperly used the ongoing grand jury process in San Francisco as both a sword and a shield to deny Mr. Ulbricht access to and use of important evidence, and a fair trial,\u201d Lewis said. Ulbricht\u2019s defense knew about the investigation but couldn\u2019t use it because it was under seal, according to the lawyer. His lawyers will use it in their appeal, she said. Whether the case against the investigators leads to a reversal of Ulbricht\u2019s conviction will depend on what evidence can be tied to their misconduct, said Terree Bowers, a former U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who\u2019s now with Arent Fox LLP. \u201cIt it\u2019s not critical to the conviction, then the conviction may stand,\u201d Bowers said in a phone interview. According to testimony at Ulbricht\u2019s trial, the underground website handled $214 million in illegal transactions paid for in bitcoins. After extorting Ulbricht, Force wired about $235,000 to an account in Panama to hide it, according to the criminal complaint filed in San Francisco federal court. He\u2019s also accused of using his position as a DEA agent to run illegal criminal history checks for a digital currency company in which he himself had invested $110,000. In addition, prosecutors allege Force used his supervisor\u2019s signature stamp on a subpoena to unfreeze one of his own accounts that had been blocked for suspicious activity. Force is being held pending a bail hearing on Thursday, said Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department spokesman. His attorney, Ivan Bates of Baltimore, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. Bridges allegedly filed an affidavit for a warrant to seize the Mt. Gox Co. exchange, where Silk Road bitcoins were stored, and its owner\u2019s bank accounts two days after he had taken his own money out of it, according to the criminal complaint. \u201cMr. Bridges, a former law enforcement officer with an unblemished record, maintains his innocence,\u201d his lawyer, Steven Levin, said in an e-mail. \u201cHe will fight the charges in the appropriate place at the appropriate time.\u201d Ulbricht, 30, faces as long as life in prison after jurors took just 3 1/2 hours Feb. 4 to find him guilty on all seven federal charges he faced. Prosecutors claimed he ran Silk Road from 2011 to 2013, armed only with a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection. When he was arrested, his computer was filled with evidence showing he conceived the site and ran it, they said. The jurors heard evidence that Ulbricht paid $150,000 to someone claiming to be a member of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang to kill a Silk Road user who called himself FriendlyChemist. The government claimed FriendlyChemist sought to extort Ulbricht by threatening to publish a list of names and addresses of Silk Road sellers and buyers unless he was paid $500,000. Ulbricht didn\u2019t face murder solicitation charges in the trial and prosecutors said they don\u2019t believe any murders were carried out. The judge in New York said the government could use the evidence to show Ulbricht\u2019s connection to Silk Road. Ulbricht still faces one murder solicitation charge in Baltimore. The case is U.S. v.

The government learned of the multiple attempts by Bridges to change his identity just hours before an otherwise routine hearing Monday in which he was scheduled to plead guilty to money laundering and obstruction of justice, prosecutor Kathryn Haun told U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco. Haun told the judge that Bridges, who reached the plea deal in June, may try flee if allowed to remain free on bail and should be locked up while he awaits his sentencing in December.

A yearlong legislative push in 2013 from President Enrique Pena Nieto culminated with a bill approved last month to open the nation\u2019s energy industry to more private investment, prompting Standard & Poor\u2019s to raise the country\u2019s credit rating one step to BBB+, the third-lowest investment grade. The government estimated an energy overhaul will lift economic growth by 1 percentage point by 2018. In addition to the law that ends Petroleos Mexicanos\u2019s 75-year production monopoly and will allow for companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. to develop crude, Pena Nieto shepherded through at least 10 constitutional amendments in his first year in office. The changes included legislation to curb the market power of dominant telecommunications companies, such as billionaire Carlos Slim\u2019s America Movil SAB.

Pot Shops Open in Denver as Colorado Projects $578 Million Sales Fourteen shops selling marijuana legally were expected to open in Denver yesterday, having obtained state and local licenses in time to sell marijuana to anyone 21 or older starting Jan. 1, just over a year after Colorado and Washington voters made their states the first to legalize recreational use. Washington\u2019s shops are expected to open later this year. Colorado projects $578.1 million a year in combined wholesale and retail marijuana sales to yield $67 million in tax revenue, according to the Legislative Council of the Colorado General Assembly. Wholesale transactions taxed at 15 percent will finance school construction, while the retail levy of 10 percent will fund regulation of the industry. Licenses for 136 marijuana stores, a majority in Denver, were mailed Dec. 23, the Colorado Revenue Department said in a statement. Recreational marijuana businesses can open only after receiving both a state and local license, said Julie Postlethwait, a spokeswoman for the Marijuana Enforcement Division. Only existing medical-marijuana retailers can apply for the licenses until July 1, she said. In Denver, home to the state\u2019s largest number of such dispensaries, that deadline extends through Jan. 1, 2016. The city\u2019s newly licensed shops feature names such as The Green Solution, The Healing House Denver and The Denver Kush Club, according to a map on the Denver city government\u2019s website. Colorado residents with a photo identification showing they are at least 21 may buy as much as one ounce of pot in a single transaction, while those from out of state can get a quarter ounce, Postlethwait said. Customers can\u2019t consume the product in public, including at the shops. Marijuana possession and sale remains illegal under federal law. In August, the U.S. Justice Department said it wouldn\u2019t challenge the legalization laws in Washington and Colorado provided the states prevent out-of-state distribution, access to minors and drugged driving, among other restrictions. In Washington, retailers will begin selling marijuana around June, according to Brian Smith, a spokesman for the State Liquor Control Board, which is overseeing the industry. Bank Indonesia Hands Over Bank Supervisory Role to OJK Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo and Financial Services Authority Chairman Muliaman Hadad signed a document in a ceremony signaling the handing-over of the bank supervisory role to the authority in Jakarta Dec. 31. Bank Indonesia will continue to coordinate with the Financial Services Authority, known as OJK, for at least another three years, Martowardojo said. The central bank handed over a 500-page book detailing the latest developments in the banking industry to OJK, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Halim Alamsyah said at a press briefing.

China Approves $353 Million of Share Sales as IPOs to Resume China\u2019s securities regulator approved the initial public offerings of five companies seeking to raise about $353 million, paving the way for share sales to resume after a freeze of more than one year. Neway Valve (Suzhou) Co. received approval for a first-time sale in Shanghai that could seek about 839 million yuan ($138 million) and will start marketing its shares early this month, the maker of industrial valves said in statements to the Shanghai Stock Exchange Dec. 30. Truking Technology Ltd., Guangdong Qtone Education Co., Guangdong Xinbao Electrical Appliances Holdings Co. and Zhejiang Wolwo Bio-Pharmaceutical Co. secured approval to list on the smaller Shenzhen exchange, separate filings by the companies showed. China hasn\u2019t had an initial public offering since October 2012 as the securities regulator cracked down on fraud and misconduct among advisers and issuers. Fifty companies are expected to be ready by the end of January, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said Nov. 30 after pledging to move toward a U.S.-style IPO registration system. It will take about a year to clear the backlog of more than 760 companies waiting to go public, the CSRC said when announcing the changes to the IPO system. Another several companies will likely receive approvals in the next few days, the China Securities Journal reported Dec. 31, citing unidentified people at the companies. SAC Said to Gain 20% in 2013 Amid Federal Insider-Trading Probe SAC Capital Advisors LP, the $14 billion hedge-fund firm run by Steven Cohen, posted a 20 percent gain last year through the last full week of 2013 amid the U.S. government\u2019s insider-trading probe, according to a person briefed on the returns. SAC rose 1.9 percent during the last month through Dec. 27, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Cohen\u2019s firm agreed in November to plead guilty and pay a record $1.8 billion for perpetrating an insider-trading scheme stretching back to about 1999. Earlier this month, a federal jury found former SAC manager Michael Steinberg guilty of using illegal tips to trade stocks of technology companies. Another manager, Mathew Martoma, is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 6. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July filed an administrative action against SAC founder Cohen, 57, who hasn\u2019t been charged with a crime. Reuters reported SAC\u2019s returns Dec. 31. Volcker Rule Court Halt Request Withdrawn by Bankers Association The American Bankers Association dropped its request for a federal judge to temporarily block Volcker Rule restrictions on collateralized debt obligations backed by trust-preferred securities. The industry group said the temporary restraining order it had requested is no longer needed after regulators said Dec. 27 they are reviewing challenged aspects of the rule, according to a filing Dec. 30 in federal court in Washington. The bankers group isn\u2019t withdrawing the lawsuit. The American Bankers Association, which represents mostly community banks, alleged in its complaint against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and other regulators that small banks will suffer about $600 million in losses because the final version of the Volcker Rule requires them to divest their holdings in some CDOs. Regulators said Dec. 27 that they were reviewing whether it would be \u201cappropriate and consistent\u201d with the Volcker Rule to allow exemption of TruPS-backed CDOs. They said they will address the matter by Jan. 15. The case is American Bankers Association v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 13-cv-02050, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).

Revenue rose 1.6 percent to $2.53 billion, falling short of analysts\u2019 estimates of $2.55 billion, as expenses climbed 8.5 percent to $1.16 billion. Global debit and credit spending volume growth remained unchanged as spending increased 7.6 percent in the U.S. and 2.7 percent in Asia, while declining 15 percent in Latin America. Adjusting for currency fluctuations, worldwide spending advanced 13 percent. The company in September forecast slower growth in earnings per share from 2016 to 2018 compared with the previous three-year period. Revenue growth is expected to increase at a \u201clow double digits\u201d pace, the company said, compared with 11 percent to 14 percent in the earlier period.

Yang, a co-founder of Yahoo! Inc., quickly introduced TangoMe to an Alibaba executive. That led to a meeting with Yang, Alibaba Vice Chairman Joe Tsai and the young company at its Space Odyssey room in Mountain View, California, in late 2013, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. By March, Alibaba had agreed to invest $215 million in TangoMe as part of a round that valued the startup at more than $1 billion. \u201cWe have been extremely fortunate to have Jerry Yang as an investor and as an adviser,\u201d TangoMe co-founder Eric Setton said in an e-mail. \u201cHe is always available to discuss strategy and help with his extensive network.\u201d Yang, 45, the onetime hotshot entrepreneur who co-founded Yahoo while at Stanford University with David Filo in 1994, is now putting his deep ties to China\u2019s largest e-commerce provider and his considerable Silicon Valley Rolodex to work as Alibaba prepares to go public this month. The moves underscore Yang\u2019s re-emergence after he stepped back from Internet pioneer Yahoo in 2012. The comeback is set to be cemented by Alibaba\u2019s initial public offering, with the Hangzhou, China-based company saying in June that Yang will rejoin its board after the public-market debut. \u201cHe is a strong, clear, and insightful voice in the boardroom,\u201d Lenovo Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing said of Jerry Yang, who joined the Chinese computer maker\u2019s board as an observer last year. Lenovo\u2019s CEO, who isn\u2019t related to the Yahoo co-founder, declined to comment on the new Alibaba board position, adding that Yang \u201chas helped to build meaningful bridges between Lenovo and the Silicon Valley community.\u201d Alibaba\u2019s IPO is the most closely watched in technology this year. The e-commerce giant\u2019s roadshow began this week and it is scheduled to price its IPO on Sept. 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company, which plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange, is seeking a valuation of as much as $162.7 billion, larger than 95 percent of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. The shares of Yahoo rose less than 1 percent to $41.26 at the close in New York, and have advanced 2 percent this year. Yang, who was born in Taiwan and speaks Mandarin, previously served on Alibaba\u2019s board for six years before stepping down in 2012. He will join a board that is expanding to nine after the IPO. Directors include Alibaba founder Jack Ma, Softbank Corp.\u2019s CEO Masayoshi Son, as well as six new incoming members. Those new appointees include Yang, J. Michael Evans, the former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Tung Chee-Hwa, the former chief executive of Hong Kong. \u201cJerry Yang is one of the great innovators of our time and he brings important expertise and experience to our company,\u201d Jim Wilkinson, an Alibaba senior vice president, said in a statement. Yang declined to comment for this story. Yang is raising his profile again in the technology industry in other ways apart from Alibaba and Lenovo. In November, he joined the board of Pleasanton, California-based Workday Inc., a provider of human resources and finance software. He\u2019s also a founding partner of AME Cloud Ventures, which was started in 2012, and has invested in startups such as Scanadu Inc., a personalized health electronics company. Yang\u2019s ties with Alibaba go back to 1997 when he visited China and met Alibaba\u2019s Ma. At the time, Ma was briefly employed by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two men became friends during hikes on the Great Wall of China, Yang said during a presentation at an Internet conference in Hangzhou in 2005. The two technology leaders\u2019 lives became more closely entwined in 2005 when Yahoo poured $1 billion into Alibaba, a hefty sum at a time when Yahoo\u2019s gross annual revenue was $5.3 billion. \u201cI have confidence in Jack,\u201d Yang said a month after the investment. The investment also put Yang onto Alibaba\u2019s board for the first time. In the ensuing years, Yahoo lost ground to rivals including Google Inc., particularly with search and advertising revenue. Yang became CEO of the Sunnyvale, California-based company in June 2007. During his tenure in that role, Yang spurned an acquisition offer from Microsoft Corp. for Yahoo, a decision that triggered criticism of his leadership. In early 2009, he stepped down as CEO to make room for Carol Bartz. Yang remained influential as a director at Yahoo and Alibaba during Bartz\u2019s tenure, even as tensions rose between the two companies. In 2010, the companies couldn\u2019t come to an agreement that would enable Alibaba to buy back shares held by Yahoo. In 2011, the companies also clashed over how a spinoff of the Chinese company\u2019s Alipay business was managed. Yang\u2019s ties to Ma helped keep the relationship from fraying further, according to people familiar with the matter. In early 2012, Yang left the boards of Yahoo and Alibaba. In a letter to then-Yahoo chairman Roy Bostock, Yang wrote that \u201cthe time has come for me to pursue other interests.\u201d The move followed months of investor frustration with Yahoo, as activist fund Third Point LLC demanded two board seats and asked for Yang to depart as a director. Since then, Yang has receded from view. While he has been less visible publicly, he has been busy behind the scenes investing around Silicon Valley. That includes his efforts with AME Cloud Ventures, which focuses on investing in closely held technology companies. He\u2019s also been seen at technology gatherings with Silicon Valley executives, including the Allen & Co. event in Sun Valley, Idaho, last year. Wences Casares, CEO of bitcoin-focused startup Xapo Ltd., took an investment from Yang earlier this year. He said Yang has earned a reputation in Silicon Valley as a smart investor who works well with entrepreneurs. He also appreciated Yang\u2019s connections in Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a seal of approval to have him invest in us,\u201d Casares, whose Palo Alto, California-based company provides secure online storage for bitcoins, said in an interview. \u201cWe jumped at that opportunity.\u201d Yahoo is also set to benefit from Yang\u2019s investor acumen. Since Yang championed Yahoo\u2019s investment in Alibaba nine years ago, the stake has pushed up the Web portal\u2019s value. When Alibaba goes public, Yahoo will sell as much as 140 million shares of the Chinese company, or about a quarter of its holdings, potentially reaping $8 billion or more. Yahoo has said it plans to return at least half the cash to investors. CEO Marissa Mayer, who is trying to turn around the Web portal, also can use some of the proceeds for acquisitions. During a call with investors in July, Mayer, who joined Yahoo in 2012, thanked Alibaba\u2019s Ma and Tsai, saying she appreciated the relationship with the company and the value that\u2019s delivered to Yahoo. Mayer also gave credit to Yang, saying she wanted to \u201ctake a moment and offer a word of thanks\u201d to \u201cour founder, Jerry Yang, who identified Alibaba as an investment opportunity and really championed it here at Yahoo.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-11/yahoo-s-yang-is-back-playing-alibaba-board-power-broker', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 11, 20, 15, 20, 449000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Yahoo\u2019s Yang Is Back Playing Alibaba-Board Power Broker'}, {'articleText': u'  Bill Miller, the fund manager best known for value stock picks at Legg Mason Inc., said he owns Bitcoin through his personal investments, adding to a chorus of investors touting the virtual currency\u2019s potential. \u201cBitcoin is like making a venture bet,\u201d Miller, who beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index for a record 15 years through 2005 when he ran the Legg Mason Capital Management Value Trust, said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cSurveillance\u201d with Tom Keene. \u201cThe potential return is huge.\u201d Miller, 64, joins Michael Novogratz, a principal at private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC, in buying bitcoin, a digital currency that has attracted attention from investors and regulators. Novogratz said in October he\u2019d taken a \u201cnice little Bitcoin position\u201d with his own money. Pantera Capital Management LP, which manages money for Fortress executives, disclosed in a December regulatory filing that it had formed a $147 million investment fund for Bitcoin. Created by an anonymous developer or developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the most popular digital currency. Governments around the world are grappling with how to classify and regulate virtual currencies while exchanges have struggled to defend holdings from theft. Hackers may have stolen more than $390 million in Bitcoin from Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest exchange for digital currency transactions. The price has dropped 28 percent since Jan. 31 to $608.82 yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Bitcoin is \u201can interesting intellectual and technological experiment,\u201d Miller said, adding he would buy Bitcoin for his funds \u201cwhen Bloomberg can get a quote on it and it can be securely stored.\u201d Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins who claimed Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social-networking website to start Facebook Inc., have said they are seeking to open the first exchange-traded fund tracking the virtual asset. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said in a report last week that Bitcoin may have a future as an innovative payments technology instead of gaining wider use as a true alternative currency. Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology could also enable new methods for payments and e-commerce. Miller stepped down from the Legg Mason Value Trust in April 2012 after returns slumped following the financial crisis. He continues to oversee the $2.2 billion Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, co-managed by Samantha McLemore. It has returned an annual average of 31 percent over the past five years, beating 97 percent of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Miller also opened his own new fund, the Miller Income Opportunity Trust, on Feb. 28. He manages the fund with his son, William Miller IV.

Masters is interested in the blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin, which is at the center of much hype as well as promise for transforming Wall Street trading.\xa0Blockchain technology, a shared, cryptographically secure ledger of transactions, could save major financial institutions billions of dollars on the cost of settling trades and other financial transactions, while improving efficiency and reducing errors. "That\u2019s a pretty long list of positive attributes," said Masters. Digital Asset Holdings, which she joined in March, designs software that banks, exchanges and other market players can use to make financial transactions more efficient with blockchain technology. Financiers have begun sizing up blockchain\u2019s potential as a tool for markets. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG have all joined startup R3 in developing protocols for using blockchain to speed execution and settlement of trades in markets including syndicated loans and repurchase agreements.\xa0 A recent study found 94 percent of financial services professionals surveyed on Wall Street said blockchain-- also called a distributed ledger or decentralized ledger-- could be used in finance. Some companies have already put the blockchain to use as a mechanism for ATM withdrawals, gold bullion-related recordkeeping and land title registries. Still, the blockchain can appear complex and intimidating even to financial professionals. "At its simplest level, a blockchain is nothing much more than a fancy kind of database," Masters said.

Ilhwan Yum, a former special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told jurors in Ulbricht\u2019s conspiracy and drug trafficking trial in Manhattan that he was able to trace the bitcoins from Silk Road\u2019s computer servers to the Samsung 700Z laptop that agents grabbed when Ulbricht was arrested in a San Francisco public library in October 2013. Yum, who is now a senior director with FTI Consulting Inc., testified that he used Blockchain, a website where bitcoin transactions are recorded. More than 700,000 bitcoins on Ulbricht\u2019s computer were traced to Silk Road, where customers used the currency to buy heroin, LSD, Ecstasy, computer hacking tools and phony identification, Yum said. About 90,000 bitcoins weren\u2019t matched to Silk Road transactions, Yum told jurors. Prosecutors claim Ulbricht was the \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d who ran the Silk Road site.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, who\u2019s overseeing the trial, denied a request from Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Dratel, for a delay until Monday to prepare to question Yum.

Later in the trial, Dratel claimed Ulbricht was set up as a \u201cfall guy\u201d by Mark Karpeles, the former head of the bankrupt Mt. Gox Co. bitcoin exchange.

The San Francisco-based company is among several upstart exchanges such as Mt. Gox and BTC-e that have emerged to support Bitcoin trading. Jered Kenna, chief executive officer of Tradehill, didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment. Tradehill registered this month with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a U.S. Treasury agency that targets money laundering, the company said in its statement. Steve Hudak, an agency spokesman, said he couldn\u2019t comment on any regulatory issues for a specific firm. FinCEN, as the Treasury agency is known, released guidance in March saying digital-currency administrators and exchangers are considered money-services businesses subject to regulations and anti-money-laundering controls. The agency, along with other federal regulators and law-enforcement officials, met this week to discuss the industry with a trade group, Bitcoin Foundation. Regulators in Tradehill\u2019s home state have also been watching virtual currencies. In May, the California Department of Business Oversight -- then the Department of Financial Institutions -- issued a cease-and-desist letter to Bitcoin Foundation to stop money transmission activity without state approval. The foundation said in a response letter that it \u201cdoes not operate a bitcoin exchange and does not sell bitcoin to consumers.\u201d Mark Leyes, a spokesman for the California regulator, said the agency does not discuss its actions regarding specific firms. Tradehill told customers last week it would transfer their accounts to a U.S. credit union to make it easier to complete transactions. The company said in an e-mail to clients that customer accounts were being frozen as of Aug. 23 for the move, and clients who didn\u2019t want to switch to the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union were offered the option to liquidate their holdings. The credit union is also concerned that the regulatory environment for Bitcoin trading requires greater \u201cclarity,\u201d according to the firm\u2019s CEO, Jordan Modell. \u201cOur credit union has worked within the evolving regulatory environment, which has not always been easy,\u201d Modell wrote in a blog post on his firm\u2019s website. \u201cUntil we have further clarity, we are unable to service some of our corporate members.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-30/bitcoin-exchange-tradehill-pauses-trading-for-regulatory-reasons', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 8, 30, 23, 21, 46, 799000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Exchange Tradehill Pauses for Regulatory Reasons'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin, the virtual money that exists only in digital form, is spawning a real-world hardware boom. The currency, used to buy and sell everything from electronics to illegal drugs on the Web, has surged to about $135, more than 10 times its value a year ago. The rally has created a cottage industry of speculators eager to get their hands on Bitcoins, which can only be created digitally by using powerful computers to solve complex software problems. That has in turn boosted a market for high-powered machines, some costing more than $20,000 apiece, which are custom-made to unlock new Bitcoins in a process called mining, a nod to the excavation of minerals and metal ore. \u201cMining can actually be quite profitable when miners are able to get their equipment in a timely manner, which is what keeps many of us looking for better, faster and cheaper hardware all the time,\u201d said Andrew Korb, who set up a fund that buys systems to mint Bitcoins and shares the proceeds with investors. Beyond investing in the currency, the speculation has extended to equipment manufacturers targeting Bitcoin miners and automated teller-like machines for cashing in or exchanging the currency. Startups such as Butterfly Labs Inc., KnCMiner AB and Robocoin Technologies say hardware sales have soared along with the price of Bitcoins. Korb, 24, has persuaded 65 people to invest 907 Bitcoins worth more than $100,000 in the Korb & Co. Investments Mining Fund. The group, which has a prospectus online, has bought computers from Butterfly, KnCMiner and CoinTerra to crunch data. His CoinTerra gear has yet to be delivered because the startup hasn\u2019t begun shipping yet. \u201cLike during the gold rush, it\u2019s the shovel companies that made money,\u201d Korb said in an interview. Korb, based in Burlington, Vermont, is taking a risk, since the cryptographic challenges embedded in Bitcoins get increasingly complicated as more digital money is created. That in turn fuels greater demand for computing power. The virtual currency was designed that way, so that the money self-regulates supply and prevents out-of-control inflation. Since being introduced four years ago by a programmer or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, there are now 11.8 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks the digital currency\u2019s activity. Butterfly Labs, whose mining computers can cost more than $22,000 apiece, has sold thousands of units, posting revenue that\u2019s growing by triple digits annually, according to Jeff Ownby, vice president of marketing and e-commerce. CoinTerra, based in Austin, Texas, raised $1.5 million in funding from angel investors in August. Virtual Mining Corp. started taking orders for its equipment in July, with one recent purchase reaching $140,000, Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Slaughter said. \u201cWe are starting to do a lot of big sales,\u201d said Slaughter, who is also mining Bitcoins. About 1 million Bitcoins are being generated by miners every year, estimated Tuur Demeester, an investor in CoinTerra. The total number of Bitcoins is capped at 21 million, based on rules embedded within the software code, and the increasing complexity of the cryptographic problems for creating them means it will probably take years to reach that limit. In 2009, people could mine 50 coins every 10 minutes. By the end of 2012, that amount was halved to 25 coins, said Slaughter. Double Investment? CoinTerra received 125 orders for its mining equipment on its first day of sales, with the initial delivery scheduled in December, according to CEO Ravi Iyengar, a former chip-design researcher at Samsung Electronics Co. and Nvidia Corp. Customers will recoup their investment in less than 60 days -- and double or triple their investments within a year, he said. \u201cBitcoin is all about performance,\u201d Iyengar said. \u201cThe greater performance, the greater share of Bitcoins you can get.\u201d Dabbling in the Bitcoin market carries risks. First, the inherent difficulty of unlocking new Bitcoins makes it costly. Virtual Mining\u2019s Slaughter said the sooner people start mining, the more likely they are to make a return on their investment in computing hardware. Yet the more Bitcoins created, the more complicated the process becomes, increasing the computing power needed to make them -- and the expense of doing so. \u201cA lot of the manufacturers started shipping, and it\u2019s twice as difficult to mine these coins than a month ago,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cThe difficulty is going to shoot up so fast. People are going to say they can\u2019t make any money.\u201d Slaughter, who runs six Avalon mining machines from BitSynCom LLC that cost him $1,500 each, said he\u2019s creating about 1.2 Bitcoins per day, or the equivalent of about $162. That\u2019s down from $300 a day in September and $1,200 a day in August. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a wash due to the amount of energy used and the time used,\u201d said Ugo Egbunike, senior ETF specialist at IndexUniverse, an index-fund researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s probably correlated with the growth in Bitcoin\u2019s popularity. They might be a little misled in how much yield they could get out of these mining strategies.\u201d The Bitcoin market is also volatile. The currency\u2019s value dropped as much as 33 percent earlier this month after the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation seized the \u201cSilk Road Hidden Website,\u201d an online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods where anonymous users conducted transactions with the digital currency. The closing spurred concern that demand for the currency would decline. The value of Bitcoins has since recovered. Some people are buying Bitcoins as a refuge amid concern that the U.S. will breach its debt ceiling, hurting the U.S. dollar. Bitcoins are also being purchased as a hedge against a rising rate of inflation in Argentina. \u201cIf there\u2019s a U.S. default, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the value of Bitcoins is back above $200,\u201d Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, an investor group focused on Bitcoin startups, said in an interview. The value of Bitcoin rose 11 percent to $135.40 on Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp today, according to tracker Bitcoincharts.com. The burgeoning hardware market isn\u2019t limited to mining gear. Demand is also emerging for automated teller machines that exchange Bitcoins for dollars, euros and other legal tender. Three New Hampshire residents are working on making Bitcoin ATMs for a venture called Lamassu Inc. Designed in Portugal and costing as much as $5,000, about 40 of the machines have been ordered from customers from as far away as Australia, Denmark and Brazil, CEO Zach Harvey said. Robocoin, another Bitcoin ATM maker, unveiled a machine in August priced at $18,500. The Las Vegas-based company received 15 orders in the first 36 hours, according to CEO Jordan Kelley. \u201cSince we\u2019ve announced preorders, it\u2019s been insane, Kelley said. \u2018\u2018My fingers are cramping from writing e-mails.\u201d Based on initial demand, he projects sales of 100 units in the first year. Mitchell Demeter, a 27-year-old who operates a physical dollar-to-Bitcoin exchange store in Vancouver, said he\u2019s ordered five Robocoin machines. \u201cWe are looking to scale our business, and doing so would require a lot of manpower,\u201d Demeter said. \u201cRobocoin solved those problems for us.\u201d He\u2019s planning to put the ATMs at coffee shops and other locations throughout Canada, and recoup his investment in three to six months by charging a fee of about 3 percent per transaction. Like Demeter, many Bitcoin buyers are young. Many have attended local Bitcoin-enthusiast gatherings and have purchased everything from beer to luxury cars using the currency. \u201cEverybody is trying to get in early at this point,\u201d Egbunike said. \u201cIt\u2019s people trying to get in before the rush.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-15/bitcoin-mining-rush-means-real-cash-for-hardware-makers', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 10, 15, 4, 1, 0, 9000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Mining Rush Means Real Cash for Hardware Makers'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin\u2019s price climbed to a record at $330.01 on the BitStamp online exchange, as U.S. senators scheduled a hearing to discuss the future of the digital money and other virtual currencies. The U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will meet on Nov. 18 \u201cto explore potential promises and risks related to virtual currency for the federal government and society at large,\u201d it said in a statement today. The price of Bitcoins has more than doubled even after the closing five weeks ago of the \u201cSilk Road Hidden Website,\u201d where people could obtain drugs, guns and other illicit goods using Bitcoins. While the digital money lost a third of its value in the days after the website was shut down, it\u2019s becoming an increasingly popular way of paying for goods and services on the Web and in stores that accept the tender. \u201cBitcoin is obviously getting a lot of attention from the federal government on the regulatory side,\u201d Nicholas Colas, an analyst at ConvergEx Group, said in an interview. \u201cGiven the involvement of the currency in illegal activities, that is entirely warranted. I expect these hearings to be largely informational, which is good for Bitcoin.\u201d The hearing, titled \u201cBeyond Silk Road: Potential Risks, Threats, and Promises of Virtual Currencies,\u201d will invite witnesses to testify about the challenges facing law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and include views from \u201cnon-governmental entities who can discuss the promises of virtual currency for the American and global economies.\u201d Bitcoin reached a record on BitStamp, one of the more active Web-based exchanges where the digital money is traded for dollars, euros and other currencies. Bitcoins were trading at $323 apiece at 12:36 p.m. in New York. The virtual currency exists as software that\u2019s designed to be untraceable, making it an attractive tender for those seeking to trade anonymously via the Web. There are about 30 transactions per minute, at an average amount of 16 Bitcoins, according to a report this week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. \u201cThe architecture of the system is elegant from a computer-science perspective, but hard for a non-tech person to understand,\u201d Colas said. \u201cGetting industry professionals to close this gap will be very helpful.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-08/bitcoin-at-record-senate-seeks-to-discuss-virtual-money', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 8, 17, 58, 55, 61000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin at Record, Senate Seeks to Discuss Virtual Money'}, {'articleText': u'  As the Internet took off, newspaper publishers, record labels and travel agencies were all walloped by the emergence of free online alternatives. Today, the range of threats to businesses is widening as companies from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Intel Corp. and Siemens AG grapple with similar dilemmas. At this week\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, technological disruption -- and what companies are doing to prepare for it -- is on executives\u2019 minds, and was the subject of a Bloomberg Television panel today on the slopes of the Alpine resort town. When meeting with chief executive officers, \u201cwhat you hear is, technology is moving three to five times faster than management,\u201d said Dominic Barton, the global managing director of consultancy McKinsey & Co., who is in Davos. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be excited or paranoid. It means you can do new things, but it also means competitors can come out of nowhere.\u201d Today\u2019s panel included Qualcomm Inc. CEO Paul Jacobs and incoming Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, discussing how innovation will affect the global marketplace this year. The last year saw a run of bad news for big corporations, even as a recovery in the U.S. and European economies took hold. Wal-Mart in November cut its annual profit forecast for the second time since mid-2013 as Amazon.com Inc. expands its online retail offerings. Wal-Mart is improving its online services by using its existing distribution network and constructing large fulfillment centers, spokesman Dan Toporek said. The retailer has also built a Silicon Valley-based e-commerce development arm with about 2,500 staff worldwide. Intel, the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, predicted 2014 sales will be little changed from a year earlier as chips designed by smaller competitors like ARM Holdings Plc dominate the market for semiconductors in tablets and smartphones. And Siemens abandoned a profitability goal and began an overhaul of its structure as performance slumped in its infrastructure and industry units. \u201cDigitalization and software has an increasing role in what were traditional hardware markets,\u201d said Siemens CEO Josef Kaeser, who is also in Davos. \u201cThat means there are opportunities in lots of sectors for others coming into our area.\u201d For Siemens, those challenges include staying ahead of software-focused firms that are pushing into industries like energy equipment. Google Inc. this month announced a $3.2 billion acquisition of energy-management startup Nest Labs, one of a welter of companies offering tools for \u201csmart grid\u201d electrical systems. Siemens is also competing with companies like Samsung Electronics Co. in the market for medical devices. Among other measures, Siemens has tried to pre-empt the possibility of seeing its business model disrupted by creating a joint venture with Accenture Plc for energy software and services. It also appointed Jim Hagemann Snabe, who is stepping down as co-CEO of enterprise-software maker SAP AG, to its board in October. Siemens Chairman Gerhard Cromme said Snabe was brought in to improve understanding of new technologies. Like Google, many companies are turning to takeovers to avoid being disrupted, especially in the telecommunications, media, and technology, or TMT, sectors. They were a rare bright spot for dealmaking last year, with about $561 billion in announced takeovers, up 29 percent from 2012, while overall transactions rose four percent. The largest deal in those areas, Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s $130 billion buyout of Vodafone Group Plc\u2019s stake in its wireless unit, reflected the potential of so-called 4G mobile technology. Verizon, the largest U.S. mobile carrier, has said it will use full control to increase investment in 4G service, which can be sold at a premium to users. Another major deal, the $30 billion merger of Publicis SA and Omnicom Group Inc. that will create the world\u2019s largest advertising agency, was hatched in part, the companies said, to prevent Silicon Valley firms like Google and Facebook Inc. from displacing the traditional ad industry. \u201cTech business models are starting to disrupt a greater portion of the Fortune 500,\u201d said Neil Rimer, a partner at venture capital firm Index Ventures. Emerging technologies may expand the array of threats to successful companies. 3D printers, which produce complex items using extruded plastic or metal, may reduce demand for some manufactured goods and for deliveries. Sales in the 3D printing industry will approach $6 billion by 2017, compared with $2.2 billion in 2012, according to consultancy Wohlers Associates, growth that\u2019s prompting United Parcel Service Inc. to offer the service in some of its shops -- before customers start buying the printers themselves. The machines could also threaten suppliers of parts to the automotive and aerospace industries if manufacturers opt to produce the items in-house instead, according to venture capitalists. The financial industry, too, faces disruption, thanks to new models for payments and lending that cut out traditional providers. For example, China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the country\u2019s largest e-commerce firm, has begun lending to small and medium-sized businesses, posing a potential future threat to banks. Startups like Britain\u2019s Wonga.com Ltd. are doing the same. \u201cInnovation is all happening outside of banks,\u201d said Bruce Golden, a partner at Accel Partners. Risk-averse and slow to adopt new technologies, most large financial institutions \u201cdon\u2019t have the architectural skills to innovate,\u201d he said. Regulation will protect banks\u2019 existing businesses to some extent. China and Denmark have already tightened rules on the Bitcoin virtual currency amid concern over money laundering. In the U.S., politicians including Senators Tom Carper and Tom Coburn have asked regulators to lay out their plans for virtual currencies. Yet on the whole, vigorous technological competition is making it harder for big firms to innovate, said Reinhard Ploss, CEO of German semiconductor producer Infineon Technologies AG. \u201cWhen our market was young, it was easy to have an impact with new technologies,\u201d Ploss said. \u201cThat\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult.\u201d The market leader in semiconductors, Intel, is making particular efforts to find a new business model as demand for personal computers shrinks for a third year in a row. To stay ahead, Intel assigned a former Apple Inc. executive to head its New Devices division, which is seeking to develop wearable gadgets and peripherals for smartphones and tablets. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy declined to comment. The risks even to nimble firms will only grow as the so-called Millennial generation, raised on Facebook and YouTube, enters the workplace and demands better, faster technology, said Marcus Weldon, chief technology officer at Alcatel-Lucent SA. \u201cWe\u2019re at five minutes to midnight because of the evolution of the teenage population into the adult population,\u201d Weldon said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a generation that just thinks how we do things is stupid.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-23/davos-stalked-by-tech-disruption-as-intel-to-wal-mart-challenged', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 23, 12, 40, 1, 110000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Davos Stalked by Tech Disruption as Intel to Wal-Mart Tested'}, {'articleText': u'  Hackers from the U.S., Russia and Ukraine hawk computer exploits for as much as $300,000 on an underground market fueled by digital currencies like Bitcoin, a report by RAND Corp. and Juniper Networks Inc. shows. The thriving trade in software, data or commands that takes advantage of computer bugs and glitches generates billions of dollars using digital storefronts that connect sellers with buyers or where mercenaries can be hired to do the job, according to the report released today. \u201cAnyone with an Internet connection can get involved,\u201d Lillian Ablon, an information systems analyst at RAND and the study\u2019s lead author, said in a phone interview. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do something, you can find someone else to do it for you.\u201d One of the first comprehensive efforts to map out how criminal hackers operate using anonymous networks, encrypted communications and digital currencies, the 83-page report comes amid warnings by U.S. government and industry officials that digital attacks are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous. Exploits, the tools for conducting computer attacks, can be used for a range of illegal actions, from stealing data off a user\u2019s mobile device to breaching corporate databases, according to the report. In the past year, the networks of retailers Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. were breached, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other U.S. banks have defended against attacks aimed at shutting down their computers. \u201cYou have to conclude from this that the rise of these markets is giving cyber criminals more power,\u201d said Martin Libicki, a senior scientist at RAND, a Santa Monica, California-based nonprofit that does research for governments and companies. The findings were based on interviews with more than two dozen cybersecurity experts, including researchers and law enforcement officials. The report was sponsored by Sunnyvale, California-based Juniper Networks, which sells network security products and services. Hackers are increasingly using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to hide their identities, according to the report. This is in response to traditional banks cooperating with law enforcement agencies on investigations that could end in their arrests, Libicki said. Bitcoin is a legitimate currency with lawful uses, said Jim Harper, global policy counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, the trade group that promotes the currency. Criminals will use it, just like they use cash, Harper said in an e-mail. \u201cBitcoin is far from the magic cloak for criminality that early news reports portrayed it to be,\u201d he said. Prices for the tools to attack software vulnerabilities that aren\u2019t yet known or fixed by manufacturers -- commonly called zero-day exploits -- are the highest. One targeting Apple Inc.\u2019s iOS operating system in 2012 sold for as much as $250,000, according to the report. Governments, which weren\u2019t identified, \u201care increasingly showing up as buyers\u201d for zero-day exploits, the report said. Simple malicious programs, such as a do-it-yourself kit called WebAttacker that uses spam to lure victims to fake websites, sold for as little as $15 in 2006. Stolen data, such as credit card numbers and technology designs, are bought and sold through illicit forums with as many as 80,000 members that only can be accessed through virtual private networks, according to the report. Experienced hackers vet participants and restrict those who consistently fail to deliver goods and services. Credit-card data acquired in the recent breach of Target\u2019s payment processing system initially fetched anywhere from $20 to $135, according to the report. The underground economy, however, operates in many of the same ways as traditional markets. Supply and demand affect prices and large-scale data thefts like the Target attack occur about once every three years, according to the report. The U.S. has become fertile ground for homegrown hackers, the report found. \u201cIn 2013, almost a fifth of the market was U.S.-based, ranked third behind Ukraine and Romania,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThe United States has more home-grown hackers than Russia.\u201d One reason for the rise in U.S. hackers is that perpetrators are learning about hacking and financial crimes in prison \u201cso people are getting released on streets and that becomes their new set of tactics,\u201d the report found. \u201cViolent crimes go down, but financial crimes more than make up the difference.\u201d Despite efforts by law enforcement in the U.S., and other countries to crack down on financing or some of the popular marketplaces, \u201cthe hacker economy has proved to be quite resilient,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThe market bounces back after a takedown or arrest.\u201d In addition to using virtual currencies, hackers increasingly use so-called darknets, or private forums that mask their identities, according to the report. U.S. lawmakers, intelligence officials and industry representatives have said one of their biggest concerns is that terrorists will use sophisticated exploits to disrupt banks, utilities and other critical services. Terrorists weren\u2019t seen operating in the illicit forums described in the report, Libicki said. \u201cThe tools that are good for cyber crime aren\u2019t necessarily good for taking down physical systems,\u201d he said. Better cooperation between law enforcement organizations and intelligence agencies in the U.S. and other countries is needed to disrupt the underground market, Robert Dix, vice president of government affairs for Juniper Networks, said in an interview. More education to close cybersecurity gaps also is needed, he said. \u201cMost of the perpetrators don\u2019t fear being caught,\u201d Dix said. \u201cWe need to be thinking about how to disrupt the economic model that favors the bad guys.\u201d  Download: Newman on Cybersecurity and Lawsuits Over Data Breaches (Audio) ', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-25/hackers-sell-exploits-for-bitcoins-in-underground-market', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 25, 4, 0, 1, 2000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Hackers Sell Exploits for Bitcoins in Underground Market'}, {'articleText': u'  An increase in the value of bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest online currency, may fuel concerns that virtual money could undermine the role of central banks. The CHART OF THE DAY shows that bitcoin has more than doubled in the past 12 months, strengthening to $16.37 from $5.88, according to data from Mt. Gox, the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange. The money, issued by a decentralized network of computers, has recovered after falling to $2.14 in November 2011 from a high of $29.58 five months earlier. Greater demand for virtual currencies could have a negative impact on the reputation of central banks, according to a report published by the European Central Bank in October last year. Since the report was released, bitcoin has risen more than 55 percent against the dollar and use of the currency has surged. Bitpay Inc., a bitcoin payment processing company that recently raised $510,000 in an investment round, this month announced that the number of companies using its services has increased almost 50 percent to more than 2,000 since November, when blog management firm WordPress.com said it would accept the digital currency. \u201cI think the ECB obviously is concerned, and it\u2019s not reputational,\u201d said Steve Hanke, a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who helped to establish new currency regimes in countries such as Argentina and Bulgaria. \u201cI think it\u2019s a competitive threat. Maybe virtual currencies will be so convenient that they will pose a threat because of their ease of use.\u201d Virtual currencies \u201ccould have a negative impact on the reputation of central banks\u201d if their use grows considerably, the Frankfurt-based ECB said in its research paper. \u201cThis risk should be considered when assessing the overall risk situation of central banks.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-28/bitcoin-s-gains-may-fuel-central-bank-concerns-chart-of-the-day', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 1, 28, 0, 0, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin\u2019s Gains May Fuel Central Bank Concerns: Chart of the Day'}, {'articleText': u'  Two Florida men charged with using the online Bitcoins in an alleged money-laundering scheme did nothing illegal because state law covers only currency issued by the U.S. or another country, their lawyers said. Pascal Reid, 29, and Michell Abner Espinoza, 30, were charged Feb. 6 with laundering and engaging in an unlicensed money-servicing business in what one prosecutor said may be the first state charges over the use of Bitcoin. Reid\u2019s attorney, Ron Lowy, asking a Miami-Dade Circuit Court yesterday to reduce his client\u2019s $450,000 bail bond to $25,000, argued that prosecutors are attempting to apply existing laws to Bitcoin even though \u201cthe language of the Florida statutes excludes and was never intended to cover Bitcoins.\u201d \u201cNo one ever anticipated there would be a non-government form of currency, but there is,\u201d Lowy said after a court hearing. Federal prosecutors are probing possible criminal violations tied to the shutdown this week of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest exchange for digital-currency transactions, two people familiar with the matter said Feb. 26. It follows a series of charges filed by U.S. prosecutors since last year related to the currency. The Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office also requested information from the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group, and companies that have done business with Mt. Gox, said a person briefed on the foundation\u2019s contacts with prosecutors. The foundation and the companies aren\u2019t targets, the person said. Japanese authorities are also probing Mt. Gox\u2019s shutdown. Steven J. Wisotsky, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, said Lowy\u2019s strategy has \u201csubstantial merit.\u201d \u201cSuppose instead of Bitcoin, which is intended to be a medium of exchange, suppose he had traded cigarettes for U.S. cash,\u201d Wisotsky said in a phone interview. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t say that was money laundering. This is uncharted territory. The court is going to be faced with questions that, to  my knowledge, have not been resolved. Bitcoin is all so new.\u201d Both defendants, who are being held in Miami-Dade County jails, were scheduled to be arraigned yesterday. Their cases were delayed and a hearing to set Reid\u2019s bond is scheduled for March 10, while Espinoza\u2019s hearing is set for the next day. The men are accused of selling Bitcoins to undercover officers, who told them they were using the currency to launder the proceeds of credit-card fraud. Digital currency \u201cis both a new area of the law and a new area of criminal activity,\u201d Ed Griffith, spokesman for the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office, said yesterday in an e-mail. \u201cAs prosecutors, we relish the opportunity to help define the law regarding this potentially important field.\u201d A prosecutor said the cases may be the first time anyone has been prosecuted for Bitcoin activity under a state statute. \u201cThe use of Bitcoins in the transactions is a new technological flourish to this very old crime,\u201d Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said after the men were arrested. The \u201carrests may be the first state prosecutions involving the use of Bitcoins in money laundering operations,\u201d she said. Espinoza\u2019s attorney, Rene Palomino, said yesterday his client did nothing wrong. \u201cThere is no money laundering scheme or anything of that nature,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think what happened here was even a crime. Bitcoins in and of themselves are not illegal. This was a regular business transaction.\u201d He said Espinoza is \u201ca humble, simple man. He was just beginning his adult life.\u201d Lowy said Reid has been unfairly portrayed as a money launderer. \u201cHe\u2019s a poor schlep who was excited about Bitcoin,\u201d Lowy said. \u201cNow he\u2019s being made a scapegoat so they can frighten the industry.\u201d Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, has no central issuing authority and uses a public ledger to verify encrypted transactions. It has gained traction with merchants selling legitimate products while it also has been used to facilitate illegal transactions. Federal prosecutors in New York have charged several people in connection with Bitcoin transactions since October. Ross William Ulbricht, known as the \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d was arrested for allegedly operating the billion-dollar Silk Road website, where customers bought and sold illegal drugs with Bitcoins. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial Nov. 3 in Manhattan. In the Miami case, undercover police officers sought out \u201cindividuals engaged in high volume Bitcoin activity,\u201d Rundle said after the two men were arrested. In December and January, a Miami Beach police officer and a Secret Service agent bought $1,500 in Bitcoins from Espinoza and another $1,500 from Reid in separate transactions, according to arrest affidavits filed in the case. They told both men they were using the digital currency to buy stolen credit cards. The officers found the men on the Bitcoin exchange site LocalBitcoins, according to the filings. In February, Reid sold the Secret Service agent $25,000 worth of Bitcoins, paying him a $5,000 commission, police said. The Miami Beach officer tried to purchase $30,000 in Bitcoins from Espinoza, but Espinoza backed out of the deal, fearing the cash might be counterfeit, according to the affidavits. Although the defendants were paid in U.S. dollars for the Bitcoins, Lowy wrote in his motion that \u201cBitcoins may be exchanged for currency to the extent another private party is willing to buy them on an exchange or in peer-to-peer transactions. Additionally, Bitcoins do not represent a \u2018fixed amount of money\u2019 in the currency of any nation, as their value constantly fluctuates relative to government backed securities.\u201d Florida\u2019s money laundering law defines monetary instruments as \u201ccoin or currency of the United States or of any other country, travelers\u2019 checks, personal checks, bank checks, money orders, investment securities in bearer form or otherwise in such form that title thereto passes upon delivery, and negotiable instruments in bearer form or otherwise in such form that title thereto passes upon delivery.\u201d Brian Tannebaum, a Miami attorney and former president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, called Lowy\u2019s strategy brilliant. \u201cI think it\u2019s such a new and novel form of currency, there\u2019s a question of whether it really is a currency,\u201d Tannebaum said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd whether it even has value.\u201d The\xa0cases are State of Florida v.

Unusual trading patterns around 3 p.m. in London, when the so-called afternoon fix is set on a private conference call between five of the biggest gold dealers, are a sign of collusive behavior and should be investigated, New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business Professor Rosa Abrantes-Metz and Albert Metz, a managing director at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, wrote in a draft research paper. The paper is the first to raise the possibility that the five banks overseeing the century-old rate may have been actively working together to manipulate the benchmark.

Banks\u2019 Corporate-Bond Sales Said to Face SEC Probe of Favoritism The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is examining whether Wall Street banks have given certain clients preferential treatment in corporate-bond sales, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The SEC also is reviewing the banks\u2019 trading of bonds after offerings, said the person, asking not to be named because the probe is confidential. The inquiry is in early stages and may not lead to any enforcement action, the person said. The SEC sent banks requests in the fourth quarter seeking information about allocations and trading, the Wall Street Journal reported Feb. 28, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The agency is reviewing whether some money managers exert too much influence in offerings, leaving smaller investors disadvantaged in the deals, the paper said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s annual filing last week added \u201callocations of and trading in fixed-income securities\u201d to a list of activities at the New York-based firm that are subject to open regulatory scrutiny.

Gox, once the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in Japan. The collapse follows weeks of turmoil amid reports that hackers had pilfered the missing $473 million in Bitcoin from Mt. Gox, leading the company to halt withdrawals on Feb. 7. The regulation of Bitcoin and its derivatives is an unresolved question in many parts of the world. At the top U.S. derivatives regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, lawyers are considering if and how to oversee derivatives linked to Bitcoin and other digital currencies, according to two people briefed on its work. Steve Adamske, CFTC spokesman, declined to comment.

UBS Planning China Stock Futures as Hedge Demand Soars UBS AG plans to start trading Chinese stock-index futures after turnover more than tripled in the past two years amid growing investor demand for ways to hedge against equity losses. The Swiss bank will probably offer contracts on the CSI 300 Index by next year after acquiring a Chinese commodities-futures brokerage last month, said Yang Xia, the head of China equities at UBS. The use of financial derivatives in China is expanding as policy makers allow more investment from foreign money managers, loosen restrictions on hedge funds and seek a bigger role for the yuan in global capital markets.

Their proposal for an investment tracking the virtual currency Bitcoin faces a protracted fight to win over regulators and market makers. The twins, who attended Harvard University at the same time as Facebook founder Zuckerberg, this week filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, a variation of an exchange-traded fund that would hold Bitcoins and issue shares on a secondary exchange. The trust would be the first product in the $2 trillion ETF industry to track a virtual asset, rather than securities such as stocks and bonds or commodities such as gold and oil. The biggest hurdle for the 31-year-old brothers is persuading the SEC, which has moved haltingly when approving funds that break new ground, to give their product the green light. Reginald Browne, head of exchange-traded product trading at Knight Capital Group Inc., the largest lead market maker for ETFs and their cousins ETPs on the New York Stock Exchange, said he expects the examination to take years. \u201cI like new, creative ideas but I would need a lot more information to figure out the investor metrics of that proposal,\u201d Browne, who is based in Jersey City, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. ETPs require the backing of a lead market maker, a trading firm that agrees to quote prices to buyers and sellers of its shares at all times. Knight\u2019s position as largest market maker is followed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to Laura Morrison, head of trading and listing services for ETFs at NYSE Euronext. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to buy and sell a broad range of items, from electronics to illegal narcotics. Created four years ago by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, the value of Bitcoins has varied widely, reaching a high of $266 in the second quarter and a low of $45, according to the filing. The Winklevosses own about $10 million of Bitcoins, 1 percent of the outstanding amount. Regulators haven\u2019t released comprehensive guidance on how Bitcoins might be regulated. Individuals who own and trade them aren\u2019t required to register as money-service businesses, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said in a report released on March 18. \u201cWhen I read the headlines my initial reaction was to chuckle,\u201d William Borden, a senior vice president for wealth management at UBS AG in San Francisco. \u201cWhile I find developments in the Bitcoin story to be intriguing, I doubt that the Winklevoss ETF would be how I would play it should I ever decide to buy Bitcoin.\u201d The first and largest ETP, the $134 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, appeared in 1993 as an easy way for investors to track the S&P 500 Index with a single security that trades throughout the day like a stock. The industry has expanded steadily into bonds, commodities, currencies and other asset classes, capturing $2.14 trillion as of May 30, according to research firm ETFGI LLP in London. Most ETPs in the U.S. are structured as funds under the 1940 Investment Company Act. The proposed product would be established as a grantor trust because it wouldn\u2019t qualify as a fund, Kathleen H. Moriarty, a partner at Chicago-based law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP who helped prepare the registration statement, said in an interview. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a 1940 Act product because it would have to hold securities, and we think Bitcoins are not securities,\u201d Moriarty said. The $38.8 billion SPDR Gold Trust, which holds bars of gold bullion in a London vault, is structured as a grantor trust. Its shares, representing fractional claims on the physical gold, trade on the NYSE Arca exchange. \u201cI think there\u2019s a precedent for it in precious metals products, but this is a unique asset,\u201d Moriarty said. \u201cThere necessarily will be novel questions that need to be asked.\u201d Those questions will include whether the product is operationally sound, whether it can be hedged and whether market makers can make a \u201cfair and orderly market,\u201d said Adam Patti, chief executive officer and founder of IndexIQ Inc., a New York-based sponsor of ETFs that focus on alternative-investment strategies. The SEC\u2019s division of corporate finance reviews registration statements for securities issuers to make sure they comply with disclosure requirements, John Nester, a spokesman, said in an interview. The review doesn\u2019t produce any comment on a product\u2019s utility, he said. The Bitcoin trust would also require approval from the agency\u2019s division for trading and markets, he said. The SEC has moved at a deliberate pace in approving products that may be complex or unique in their approach. SPDR Gold Trust opened 18 months after its initial registration statement, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The agency froze approval for new ETFs that make significant use of derivatives in March 2010, seven months after warning that some products could confuse individual investors. While the ban was partly lifted in December, the SEC still doesn\u2019t approve new ETFs that amplify returns or provide the inverse performance of an index. Bitcoins are created, or \u201cmined,\u201d by computers that solve difficult cryptographic problems to verify transactions. As more Bitcoins are created, the problems become more difficult. Pioneers could mine coins on their laptops. Now, high-powered computer equipment is needed. Bitpay, Bitcoin\u2019s largest payment processor, has signed up over 4,500 merchants across the world to accept payments. The currency traded at $90 yesterday on Tokyo-based Mt.Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange. \u201cBitcoin is in many ways the cyber version of gold,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, chief marketing officer at New York-based trading services firm ConvergEx Group. \u201cThe biggest challenge will be how you categorically assure the SEC and investors that Bitcoins that underly the ETF are secure.\u201d The trust aims to attract investors who might be put off by the complexities and costs associated with trading in the digital currency. \u201cWe recognized that there was not an easy way to gain Bitcoin exposure, so we\u2019re trying to creating a simple solution,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss said in an e-mailed statement. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss rose to prominence in 2010 when they were portrayed in the movie \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d which recounts the early years of Facebook. The film includes the allegation that Zuckerberg as a Harvard sophomore agreed to write code for the twins on a similar social-networking website before surreptitiously starting Facebook. The company, which started in 2004, has since expanded to become the largest social network in the world with more than 1.1 billion users. The Winklevoss twins sued Facebook and in 2008 agreed to a $65 million cash and stock settlement. The twins later filed another suit seeking to reopen the case, saying the company didn\u2019t disclose an accurate valuation of its shares before they agreed to the deal. In 2011, a federal judge threw out the suits. The twins both participated in the 2008 Beijing Olympics where they competed in rowing.

The order reflects concern that investors using Bitcoin might not get their money back, said Bob Webster, a spokesman for the Washington-based North American Securities Administrators Association. Webster described the order as the first of its kind. Bitcoin is the most popular of a group of digital currencies that have no central issuing authority, use a public ledger to log every transaction and employ a network of volunteer computers to ensure coins cannot be spent twice. The Texas commissioner said Balanced Energy and its president, Kirk Johnson, failed to disclose to investors the risks of using Bitcoin to purchase working interests in wells located in West Texas.

It\u2019s also not a payment instrument, because the law stipulates that a payment instrument must have an issuer responsible for its operation,\u201d Paeivi Heikkinen, head of oversight at the Bank of Finland in Helsinki, said in a Jan. 16 phone interview. \u201cAt this stage it\u2019s more comparable to a commodity.\u201d Finland is the latest country to try to come to grips with the advent of virtual currencies that aren\u2019t controlled by any central bank or government.

Globally, Bitcoin has had a mixed reception, with China\u2019s central bank banning lenders from handling the virtual money. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service hasn\u2019t offered guidance on Bitcoin beyond saying it\u2019s working on the issue and that it has been monitoring digital currencies and transactions since 2007. Meanwhile, Texas Senate candidate Steve Stockman is accepting Bitcoin campaign donations. In Finland, a AAA-rated euro member that has tended to side with Germany on most economic policy matters, the response to Bitcoin by the public has been mixed. One in ten Finns is interested in investing in Bitcoin, according to a survey commissioned by stockbroker Nordnet AB from CINT AB. Among Finnish men, interest was higher at 17.2 percent. Europe\u2019s first automated teller machine for buying Bitcoin was installed at a record store at Helsinki Railway Station last month.

Though Finland\u2019s central bank rejects Bitcoin\u2019s status as a legal form of tender, Finns can legally use the software to make payments. Capital gains made on Bitcoin investments are taxed, though losses aren\u2019t deductible, according to guidelines by the tax authority. Finns are required to pay income tax on mined Bitcoins. \u201cFinns can enter into agreements on which means of exchange they want to use,\u201d Heikkinen said. \u201cNo one supervises or regulates it, no one guarantees it and its value has fluctuated hugely. It\u2019s at your own risk.\u201d The price of Bitcoins soared in November, topping $1,000 for the first time, as speculators anticipated broader use of digital money. The price has since dropped to around $820 on Bitstamp, one of the more active online exchanges where Bitcoins are traded for dollars and other currencies. One Bitcoin cost about $15 a year ago. The European Banking Authority warned in December that consumers using virtual currencies should be aware they\u2019re not protected from losses.

Tradehill is moving accounts to the credit union to win more business from investors and financial institutions that trade in Bitcoins, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren\u2019t public. Created four years ago by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to buy and sell a broad range of items -- from cupcakes to electronics to illegal narcotics. The surge in the value of Bitcoins has made millionaires out of people who loaded up on them early on -- however briefly. Many of them are self-described libertarians, drawn by the idea of a currency that exists outside the control of governments. \u201cIt\u2019s a big move for the Bitcoin market in terms of legitimizing it,\u201d Ugo Egbunike, senior ETF specialist at IndexUniverse, an index-fund researcher, said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve made it clear, the types of people they cater to: sophisticated, legitimate investors.\u201d Tradehill, based in San Francisco, is among several upstart exchanges including Mt. Gox and and BTC-e that have cropped up to support Bitcoin trading. Tradehill\u2019s client deposits will be insured for as much as $250,000, according to the e-mail to customers. Customers must provide government-issued photo identification and a social-security number to transition their Tradehill account to the credit union, according to the e-mail. Accounts were being frozen as of Aug. 23, and clients who didn\u2019t want to switch to the credit union were offered the option to liquidate their holdings, according to the e-mail. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based credit union is led by Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, one of world\u2019s largest online digital libraries. In an April blog, Kahle said that the Internet Archive began receiving donations of Bitcoins in 2011, and that he thinks of it \u201cas the local currency of the Internet.\u201d The Internet Archive set up a Bitcoin ATM, and even paid some employees in Bitcoin, he said. Kahle didn\u2019t return a request for comment. \u201cIt is vital to us to serve and protect our clients as well as facilitate law enforcement efforts to keep us all safe by combating the use of the financial system to launder money,\u201d Ryan Singer, co-founder of Tradehill, wrote in in an e-mailed statement. \u201cFor legal and confidentiality reasons, we cannot speak to our clients\u2019 banking relationships.

There\u2019s a competing digital currency angling for the spotlight. Merchants and investors are taking notice of litecoin, which is pitched by its developers as cheaper to generate, more plentiful and easier to use for small transactions than bitcoin. While prices for both have slid since a surge late last year, litecoin\u2019s remains about 490 percent higher than six months ago, compared with about 140 percent for bitcoin. Daily litecoin transactions also have climbed faster. The total value of litecoins available for use ranks second only to bitcoin\u2019s, according to CoinMarketCap, a website tracking more than 200 digital currencies. That status has helped make litecoin an obvious alternative for investors and enthusiasts seeking new opportunities to profit from virtual money. \u201cLitecoin right now is where bitcoin was the same time last year,\u201d Michael Curry, co-founder of Canadian digital-currency exchange Vault of Satoshi, said in an interview. \u201cAs people are becoming more familiar with bitcoin, they are starting to see there are other coins out there.\u201d Bitcoins jumped from about $13 at the start of last year to more than $1,200 in December, then slid to about $490 as of yesterday, according to CoinDesk, which tracks prices across key exchanges. Litecoins, which surpassed $48 in November, traded for about $12 yesterday, according to data from exchange BTC-e. The average number of daily transactions in litecoins this month is 155 percent greater than October\u2019s level, according to CoinDesk data. That compares with a 19 percent increase for bitcoins. Daily transactions in bitcoins this month still outnumber those in litecoins almost sevenfold, the data show. Technology enthusiasts and venture capitalists are pitching digital currencies as fast and cheap alternatives to traditional financial systems, in which middlemen such as networks, merchant acquirers and banks take a cut. Backers also argue that instruments such as bitcoin may be of use to people and businesses in countries with unstable currencies. Litecoins are drawing notice in part because they can be mined more cheaply than bitcoins. The process uses computers to solve software problems and unlock new digital coins. While bitcoin speculators compete with increasingly expensive machines, litecoins were designed to be efficiently mined with consumer-grade hardware, even if some miners prefer powerful processors. Sam Cole, co-founder of KnCMiner, one of the biggest mining companies, said equipment used for mining litecoins and similarly designed alternative currencies now accounts for 60 percent of sales. The maximum number of litecoins that can be mined is four times more than that for bitcoins, potentially making them more attractive to users and miners. Miners have more rewards to go around, while consumers may see litecoins as more affordable, even if bitcoins are typically spent in pieces. \u201cThis will make litecoin appear more accessible, since its price will climb more slowly than bitcoin,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, a trading services company in New York. While both digital currencies can be used at online stores for services and products, such as cosmetics and video games, bitcoin is accepted more widely. Still, some merchants are paying attention to litecoins. Patrick Byrne, chief executive officer of Overstock.com Inc., said in an interview that the online retailer is considering accepting litecoins. \u201cIt\u2019s time I start looking hard at it,\u201d said Byrne, whose Salt Lake City-based company accepts bitcoins. \u201cWe certainly want to be always at the forefront of accepting such currencies.\u201d More than 36,600 computers are part of the litecoin network, according to BitInfoCharts. That\u2019s more than half of the 63,000 nodes for bitcoin, which is more prominent and two years older. At Vault of Satoshi, litecoins account for 20 percent to 25 percent of all trades, Curry said. At Verbena Products LLC, which sells beauty supplies, litecoin accounts for more than 20 percent of all alternative-currencies sales, while bitcoin takes up the rest, President Robert Roque said in an interview. \u201cIn terms of a payment solution for us, it\u2019s as good as bitcoin,\u201d Roque said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t have the popularity of bitcoin. But a lot of exchanges are beginning to accept litecoin, and that should create liquidity for the future.\u201d Litecoin was created in 2011 by Charles Lee, who now works for bitcoin company Coinbase Inc. Based on the bitcoin software, it seeks to offer improvements on the basic technology, including a faster transaction time to ease purchases of small items, like coffee or bagels. \u201cLitecoin has always been viewed as silver to bitcoin\u2019s gold,\u201d Anton Yemelyanov, one of the core litecoin developers, said in an interview. \u201cBitcoin would be used to transact larger value transactions, whereas litecoin would absorb smaller transactional value.\u201d Some alternative-currency enthusiasts advocate investing in both bitcoins and litecoins to hedge risks. \u201cIf something like a bitcoin failure does take place, litecoin is next in line and uses a different algorithm, so likely won\u2019t fall with bitcoin,\u201d said Colin Lusk, a networking engineer in Portland, Oregon, who mines and owns both currencies. Many digital-currency prices have dropped this year as authorities in a growing number of nations resist virtual money, warning that the instruments suffer from volatility, can be exploited for money-laundering, fraud and terror financing, and may be vulnerable to robbery via hacking. Litecoin\u2019s longevity isn\u2019t assured. Some 230 alternative coins exist, according to CoinMarketCap, with more added weekly -- and nearly each one touts unique features. Several of them, such as dogecoin, are gaining attention. For now, most venture capitalists are still focused on bitcoins. \u201cAlternative currencies are great,\u201d said Adam Draper, CEO of Boost VC, which invests in bitcoin startups. \u201cThey all run into the same problem, though, which is: They are not bitcoin.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-24/bitcoin-wannabe-litecoin-emerges-as-low-price-challenger', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 4, 24, 4, 0, 7, 2000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Wannabe Litecoin Emerges as Low-Price Challenger'}, {'articleText': u'  The Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the nascent digital currency, provided information to federal prosecutors this week that aided a probe into Mt.

Gox\u2019s chief executive officer, Mark Karpeles, quit the foundation\u2019s board on Feb. 24, the group briefed the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s office with information about the possible theft of as much as $400 million from the Bitcoin exchange, according to two people familiar with the effort. They requested anonymity because the talks were private. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are probing possible criminal violations tied to the shutdown of Mt. Gox, two other people familiar with the matter said. Bharara requested that Mt. Gox preserve documents as part of the probe, one of the people said. Bharara\u2019s office also requested information from the foundation and companies that have done business with Mt. Gox, said one of the people briefed on the foundation\u2019s contacts with prosecutors. The foundation and the companies aren\u2019t targets of the investigation, the person said. Japanese authorities said earlier they are probing the exchange\u2019s shutdown as well. A statement posted yesterday on the Mt. Gox website attributed to Karpeles said he is \u201cstill in Japan\u201d working to resolve the exchange\u2019s problems. The exchange\u2019s staff has been instructed \u201cnot to give any response or information,\u201d according to the statement. Bitcoin\u2019s price was $565.34 at 10:38 a.m. London time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. It slumped as low as $418.78 on Feb. 25, and was as high as $1,151 on Dec. 4. The shuttering of Mt. Gox, once the world\u2019s largest exchange for digital-currency transactions, comes after months in which Bitcoin soared, attracting attention from investors and customers, even as regulators and lawmakers raised concern that the currency could be used for money-laundering and fraud. Japan Vice Finance Minister Jiro Aichi told reporters in Tokyo today that countries should cooperate on Bitcoin regulation. Japanese officials said this week that they don\u2019t have responsibility for overseeing the virtual currency. Tembusu Terminals Pte set up what may be Singapore\u2019s first dispensing machine for Bitcoin, the company said today, days after Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said the central bank didn\u2019t recognize it as legal tender. Andras Kristof, Tembusu\u2019s chief technical officer, said Mt. Gox\u2019s shutdown wasn\u2019t surprising in a young industry where barriers to entry are low. \u201cThey became big because they were very early in the game,\u201d Kristof said at a briefing in Singapore. \u201cBut neither their technology nor their management was up to the challenge to handle this amount of money.\u201d As reports surfaced suggesting the exchange was in trouble, other Bitcoin companies and the foundation worked to distance themselves from Mt. Gox. \u201cAs our industry matures, we are seeing a second wave of capable, responsible entrepreneurs and investors who are building reliable services for this ecosystem,\u201d the foundation said yesterday. Mt. Gox, which had the largest market share of all digital currency exchanges as recently as April 2013, went offline Feb. 25 after halting customers\u2019 Bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7. A document posted on the Internet labeled \u201cCrisis Strategy Draft\u201d said Mt. Gox had lost 744,408 Bitcoins, worth about $400 million at current rates, as a result of theft that \u201cwent unnoticed for several years.\u201d Bharara\u2019s office obtained the document from people in the digital-currency business who were worried that Mt. Gox might have broken the law, one person briefed on the discussions said. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital currency, based on a peer-to-peer software protocol, has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify transactions while preserving user anonymity. Jennifer Queliz, a spokeswoman for Bharara, said the office wouldn\u2019t comment on the existence of a federal investigation. Bharara\u2019s office has previously filed charges against Silk Road, an online drug bazaar that accepted Bitcoin, and BitInstant, a New York-based exchange. This isn\u2019t the first time Mt. Gox has drawn the attention of U.S. authorities. The Department of Homeland Security seized two bank accounts belonging to Mt. Gox worth a total of $5 million last year because the exchange wasn\u2019t registered with the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The foundation and Mt. Gox clashed on Feb. 10, before the exchange went offline, when the exchange blamed its troubles serving customers on the underlying software for Bitcoin.

The online service plans to start on a trial basis by March, after obtaining regulatory approval, and gain 1 percent market share within a year by handling 6,500 transactions a month, Chief Executive Officer Elizabeth Rossiello said yesterday in an interview in the capital, Nairobi. Bitcoin gained credibility this month after law enforcement and securities agencies said in U.S. Senate hearings that it could be a legitimate means of exchange. The price of Bitcoin today traded at a record $1,188.67 apiece on the Mt. Gox online exchange, fueled by speculators snapping up the virtual currency as it gains wider acceptance. \u201cThere are no other market entrants trying to solve the problem of the very high cost of remittances in Africa,\u201d Rossiello said. Western Union and MoneyGram International Inc. deduct $10 to $17 to wire $200 to Kenya from the U.S., including charges to exchange funds, in a process that can take an hour to five days, according to the World Bank\u2019s Send Money Africa price database. BitPesa will charge 3 percent on overseas transfers and says the money arrives the same day. At that rate, it would cost $6 to send $200 via BitPesa. Kenya is sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s third-biggest recipient of remittances, after Nigeria and Senegal, with more than 3 million people of Kenyan origin living abroad. North America is the main source of remittances to Kenya, accounting for about half, followed by Europe at almost a third. Overseas transfers to the East African country are growing almost five times faster than the sub-Saharan African average of 6.2 percent this year. The region is the world\u2019s most expensive for remittances because of factors such as limited competition and regulatory barriers, the World Bank said. BitPesa is in talks to partner with two Kenyan commercial banks, and it\u2019s also considering working with at least one telecommunications company and one money-transfer agent, Rossiello said, declining to identify the companies. Pesa means money in the Swahili language. Safaricom Ltd., 40 percent owned by Vodafone Group Plc, runs Kenya\u2019s most widely used M-Pesa mobile-phone money-transfer service, which competes with Airtel Kenya Ltd.\u2019s Airtel Money, Essar Telecoms Kenya Ltd.\u2019s YuCash and Orange Money by Telkom Kenya Ltd., a unit of France\u2019s Orange. Bitcoin is used as an alternative to cash to pay for everything from candy to smartphones on the Internet. There are more than 12 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Bitcoincharts, a website that tracks activity across exchanges. The rally in Bitcoin had gathered steam last month after regulators shut down the Silk Road Hidden Website, where people could obtain guns, drugs and other illicit goods using Bitcoins. That generated optimism the digital money would become more widely used for legal purposes. \u201cThe minute you confirm the transaction, the price is locked in,\u201d Rossiello said. \u201cWe absorb all the exchange risk, and like anyone else with foreign exchange exposure we will hedge our risk.\u201d BitPesa will need to develop its reputation in Kenya to become competitive, said Sarah Wanga, a research analyst at Nairobi-based investment company ICEA Lion Group. Commercial banks handle about half of the remittance transactions to Kenya, led by Equity Bank Ltd., the second-biggest lender by market value, and Barclays Bank Kenya Ltd.; each controlling 14 percent of the market. Western Union accounts for 31 percent of business and MoneyGram 6 percent, according to a 2010 study commissioned by the World Bank. \u201cThere is an element of reliability with banks, people have security putting their money there because it\u2019s what they are familiar with,\u201d Wanga said. \u201cBut if this new system markets itself right, makes itself a household name, and it\u2019s cheaper, I think it could become a threat.\u201d Under the model developed by BitPesa, the sender will use an Internet-based service to make payments and the funds will be traded into Bitcoins. BitPesa will then convert the virtual money back into a conventional currency at a competitive exchange rate for withdrawal by recipients through either their mobile phones or a bank account, said Rossiello.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-28/bitcoin-service-targets-kenya-remittances-with-cut-rate-fees-1-', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 28, 15, 36, 10, 916000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Service Targets Kenya Remittances With Cut-Rate Fees'}, {'articleText': u'  Bitcoin isn\u2019t just for buying and selling cupcakes and cameras anymore. A crop of entrepreneurs, backed by investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and BitAngels, are betting that the technology behind the virtual currency can be used for a range of financial tasks now handled by banks, exchanges, e-commerce providers and other middlemen. Invictus Innovations Inc., Ripple Labs Inc. and other startups are harnessing Bitcoin\u2019s underlying code for such tasks as authentication, which means making sure that a buyer isn\u2019t posing as someone else, and verification of payments to ensure that a transaction is valid. If successful, the new tools could reduce the fees shouldered by buyers and sellers in the $1.22 trillion global electronic-commerce market, as well in financial services, cloud computing and other areas. \u201cPeople are just starting to realize that Bitcoin isn\u2019t a currency and a payment system, it\u2019s the Internet of Money,\u201d David Johnston, co-founder of BitAngels, a group of investors in Bitcoin-related startups, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time.\u201d BitAngels is currently considering more than 30 projects in the Internet-of-Money category, Johnston said. There\u2019s growing recognition, even among financial firms, that Bitcoin\u2019s underlying design can be used for any transaction requiring some degree of verification. In a report this month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said while Bitcoins probably won\u2019t be viable as a currency, the basic technology \u201ccould hold promise.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s future as the Internet of Money was one of the hottest topics at the CoinSummit conference in San Francisco this week. Bitcoin captured the attention of investors and innovators last year, fueling a rally that drove the value of the digital money to about $1,200 from $12. More recently, scrutiny from governments, bans in China and India, and the collapse of online exchange Mt. Gox have cast doubt on the viability of Bitcoin as credible replacement for fiat currencies. The price of Bitcoin plunged almost 10 percent yesterday after China\u2019s central bank ordered banks and payment companies to close the trading accounts of more than 10 Bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin was valued at about $500 yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. The software behind Bitcoin relies on a public record of every transaction that\u2019s ever made. When someone spends all or part of a Bitcoin, the change in ownership is recorded by a global network of computers and posted to a public register, ensuring that the same unit of money can\u2019t be used twice. The owners of computers solving and verifying these transactions are rewarded with new Bitcoins for their work. Bitcoin\u2019s building blocks, designed to validate each transaction, are adaptable for any type of exchange, regardless of whether they are attached to a currency or not. Called a blockchain, the currency\u2019s underlying design opens up possibilities for the technology to be used in other industries, according to Marc Andreessen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who is looking to fund startups focused on this new category. \u201cThe blockchain is the core innovation,\u201d Andreessen said at CoinSummit. \u201cWe want a whole sequence of companies: digital title, digital media assets, digital stocks and bonds, digital crowdfunding, digital insurance. If you have online trust like the blockchain provides, you can reinvent field after field after field.\u201d Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz. BitShares X, a decentralized bank and exchange, is among the first Internet of Money services. Developed by Blacksburg, Virginia-based Invictus, BitShares X will debut in the second quarter and will offer users the ability to save, trade, borrow and lend financial securities, from dollars to derivatives, without an intermediary like a bank or brokerage. Transactions are handled by users\u2019 computers, and verified publicly, making theft or fraud impossible. \u201cWith a traditional exchange, you send your dollars, and they record an IOU for so many dollars,\u201d Dan Larimer, chief executive officer of Invictus, said. \u201cThe exchange can default on their IOUs to you -- Mt. Gox is an example. In our case, no one can steal the balance from your account.\u201d The technology can potentially eliminate fees, which pay for the cost of accounting systems, banking services and verification of account holders, according to Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. By eliminating most of those expenses, financial services such as escrows and dispute resolution based on the Internet of Money could represent a significant business opportunity, he said in an interview. \u201cWhat Bitcoin does, it removes the need for trust in the system,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cIt\u2019s very brilliantly designed.\u201d People buying and selling physical goods, especially expensive items such as cars and houses, can also benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s technology. EBay Inc. and real estate brokers stand in the middle of transactions, ensuring each party\u2019s identity and making sure everyone gets paid, for a fee. While this doesn\u2019t rule out person-to-person deals, many opt to pay a commission to a middleman to minimize risk. Ownership of goods could be tied to a verified digital token that can be transferred to the buyer from the seller, simultaneously with a payment. \u201cThere\u2019s a potential for at least 10 percent of the world\u2019s e-commerce to be done over the blockchain,\u201d Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, said in an interview. Keybase, another nascent idea, works as a virtual identity card, verifying people using the same underlying Bitcoin technology. In addition to confirming people for messages or e-mail, it can also be used to as a certificate of authenticity for files or online video streams. In another scenario, Bitcoin Tangible Trust lets people buy and trade gold using Bitcoin technology to validate transactions and show ownership. Ripple Gateway Pte\u2019s RippleSingapore offers a similar service for trading gold, silver, platinum and currencies. Some 200 people are using the system, which is backed by bullion reserves, and currency deposits at Singapore\u2019s Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. Digital media, such as music and video can also benefit from the same technology. Invictus is planning a service that lets users buy shares in sound tracks, for example. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for fans to buy into a song when it\u2019s new, and if it becomes popular, you can make money,\u201d Larimer said. Since digital content ownership will be verified, such a service will be a natural defense against piracy, he said. Using Bitcoin technology and cars connected to wireless networks, package courier services could evolve into a self-organizing industry. Anyone who is part of the service with a car could become a courier, picking up and delivering packages as they commute or run errands. While still a conceptual idea, the system would collect fees from senders and pay deliverers. MaidSafe has developed a service that lets consumers share storage or processing power with others, an alternative to cloud-computing providers such as Amazon Web Services. David Irvine, MaidSafe\u2019s founder, said he\u2019s working with about 20 companies that are creating Web applications. The Internet of Money isn\u2019t all about cash and software, said Dave Cohen, a 45-year-old programmer in San Francisco who is working on a way to let users cast votes using Bitcoin-based verification. \u201cI would like to see voting for the voters to be convenient, and for the vote counting to be almost instantaneous,\u201d Cohen said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and EBay have filed patents that mention digital currencies such as Bitcoin and underlying technologies. \u201cWe know for a fact that many financial companies are thinking about adopting it,\u201d Balaji Srinivasan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said in an interview. \u201cWe see banks all the time that are evaluating this for internal operations.\u201d While some of the Bitcoin 2.0 startups are using the existing Bitcoin network, many are creating alternate versions that work in the same way to provide verification. The most well-known projects are Mastercoin, Ethereum, Colored Coins, Counterparty, Ripple and BitShares. BitAngels\u2019 Johnston said the majority of his group\u2019s funding and deals will be related to Internet of Money this year. After evaluating 200 investments last year, the venture-capital group invested more than 60 percent of its funds in Mastercoin, he said. \u201cRight now, Bitcoin is in the lead,\u201d Brock Pierce, an investor in Mastercoin, said. \u201cAnd usually, the technology that gets the most adopters wins.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-28/bitcoin-2-0-shows-technology-evolving-beyond-use-as-money', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 28, 4, 1, 0, 16000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin 2.0 Shows Technology Evolving Beyond Use as Money'}, {'articleText': u'  Ukrainian activists are turning to Bitcoins to fund a three-month protest in Kiev\u2019s Independence Square that helped oust President Viktor Yanukovych amid violence that left at least 82 people dead.

The built-in anonymity has led to concern the digital currency may be used for money-laundering and illicit sales, prompting authorities in Russia, China and Israel to seek restrictions. It also sparked a debate on Bitcoin forums about who actually receives the donations and how they are used, with some posters claiming the images have been digitally altered.

Carper\u2019s staff is now writing a report about virtual currencies, which will be released by the spring of this year, his spokeswoman, Jennie Westbrook, said in an e-mail.

Bitcoin Foundation, a Seattle-based group that promotes the\ncurrency, seeks to improve standardization and security for the\n\u201cnon-political online money,\u201d according to its website.\nVessenes described the meeting as an \u201ceducational meet-and-greet.\u201d  The group is \u201ccoming in to talk to regulators, law\nenforcement and Treasury officials this afternoon as part of our\nongoing dialogue with virtual currency providers,\u201d said John\nSullivan, a Treasury Department spokesman, in a telephone\ninterview.  New York\u2019s top banking regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, sent\nsubpoenas to 22 digital-currency companies, including BitInstant\nLLC and Dwolla Corp., to determine whether new regulations\nshould be adopted to govern the emerging industry, according to\na person familiar with the matter.  OTC Derivatives Rules\u2019 Benefits Outweigh Costs, Basel Group Says  Tougher rules for trading in over-the-counter derivatives\nwill deliver economic benefits that outweigh the costs they\nimpose on banks, a study found.  A group of supervisors and central bankers set up by the\nBank for International Settlements estimated that when\nregulators have stricter standards in place, they will boost\nglobal economic output by 0.12 percent per year and the\npotential for financial crises will be reduced.  Regulators and banks should try to have the largest number\nof derivatives trades as possible pass though clearinghouses,\nthe group said in a statement yesterday. The market for OTC\nderivatives, which are traded away from exchanges and other\nregulated venues, should be based around a \u201cmodest number\u201d of\nclearinghouses, the Basel, Switzerland-based group said.  Nations are trying to bolster and align their rules for the\n$633 trillion market for swaps and other OTC derivatives, which\nbecame a target for reinforced oversight after the 2008 collapse\nof Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the rescue of American\nInternational Group Inc., two of the largest traders in credit-default swaps. Global regulatory plans include boosting the use\nof clearinghouses, pushing activity onto regulated markets and\nrequiring banks to put up more collateral against their trades.  Swedish banks, already subject to some of the world\u2019s\ntoughest capital rules, may face even higher requirements as the\ngovernment tries to protect the economy and public finances from\nfuture crises.  Financial Markets Minister Peter Norman yesterday proposed\na raft of measures aimed at strengthening bank industry\nstability in the largest Nordic economy. Steps include giving\nthe Financial Supervisory Authority more tools and putting the\nregulator in charge of oversight, according to an e-mailed\nstatement.  \u201cIn addition to these measures to form a stricter\nframework and tougher rules for the banks, the development and\nthe risks that are tied to it means it may be necessary to\nsharpen the requirements on the financial sector further in the\nfuture,\u201d Norman wrote in an opinion piece in Dagens Nyheter\nnewspaper yesterday. \u201cThat could, for example, include higher\ncapital rules for banks.\u201d  Sweden\u2019s four biggest banks already face stricter capital\nrequirements than standards targeted elsewhere. Nordea Bank AB,\nSwedbank AB, Svenska Handelsbanken AB and SEB AB must hold at\nleast 10 percent core Tier 1 capital of their risk-weighted\nassets this year, and no less than 12 percent by 2015. The Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision, headed by Swedish central bank\nGovernor Stefan Ingves, sets a 7 percent minimum from 2019.  The central bank and the financial regulator have clashed\nopenly over which body should have the main responsibility for\nlimiting systemic risk in Sweden. The proposal from the\ngovernment marks a defeat for Ingves, who had argued that the\ncentral bank is best suited to handle macro-prudential\nsupervision.  Denmark\u2019s new minister in charge of bank legislation says\nthe market should be left to itself to decide the fate of one-year mortgage bonds under threat from the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision.  The bonds are at the center of a debate in Denmark on how\nto treat one of the most popular home-loan products in the\nnation\u2019s $500 billion mortgage bond market, the world\u2019s biggest\nper capita. The central bank and rating companies have\ncriticized the bonds, which are used to finance mortgages as\nlong as 30 years, arguing the funding mismatch is too risky. The\nmodel is also at odds with Basel\u2019s proposed stable funding\nrequirement, under which banks need to be able to survive at\nleast 12 months without tapping markets.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on how the bond market will\nlook in a few years, but it will be, as it is today, the market\nthat decides,\u201d Henrik Sass Larsen, who took over as business\nminister this month, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Denmark\u2019s mortgage banks, which collectively fought to\nprevent Basel\u2019s liquidity coverage ratio from destroying their\nhome-loan model, are now split over how to tackle the new\nfunding rules. The nation\u2019s committee on too-big-to-fail banks\nhas also singled out one-year mortgage bonds as a risk. Danske\nBank A/S has said clear rules from regulators may be necessary\nas competitive pressures prevent the industry from taking the\nnecessary steps on its own initiative.  European Union banker pay rules were criticized by\nofficials in several countries on concerns they will drive up\nfixed salaries and complicate internal operations at banks.  The Financial Stability Board said authorities in some non-European nations had warned that the rules, which will ban\nbonuses more than twice as large as fixed pay, \u201cmay have\nunintended consequences\u201d and raised \u201clevel playing field\u201d\nissues. The FSB didn\u2019t identify the nations.  The board, which brings together central bankers,\nregulators and finance ministry officials from the Group of 20\nnations, called on supervisors and banks to accelerate efforts\nto apply internationally agreed-to pay standards. These include\na requirement that awards can be retroactively canceled, and\nrecovered, if a bank\u2019s finances are less healthy than previously\nstated.  The EU earlier this year overrode opposition from the U.K.\nto bolster its bonus rules, already among the toughest in the\nworld. The ban on awards worth more than twice fixed pay will\napply for the first time to bonuses awarded in 2015.  The goal of a single rule book for Europe\u2019s banks is\nsplintering even before it\u2019s implemented as northern countries\nmove ahead with tougher requirements to ward off the next boom-to-bust cycle.  Sweden\u2019s too-big-to-fail banks, which already face stricter\ncapital rules than their competitors elsewhere, may be told to\nhold even larger reserves, Financial Markets Minister Peter\nNorman said yesterday. In Denmark, Business Minister Henrik Sass\nLarsen said he can\u2019t wait for southern Europe to regulate its\nsystemically important financial institutions. He backs the\nswift passage of national capital laws to curb bank risks.  As Europe struggles to stimulate growth without stoking a\nnew credit bubble, the specter of swelling private debt is\nprompting regulators from Sweden to the Netherlands to curb\nborrowing. The measures go beyond new capital rules approved\nearlier this year by the European Union and set to become law by\nJan. 1.  In addition to steps advanced by Sweden and Denmark, the\nNetherlands proposed last week that its banks face a leverage\nratio -- a measure of capital against total assets -- of at\nleast 4 percent. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\nrecommends a 3 percent threshold. Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen\nDijsselbloem, who leads the group of 17 euro finance chiefs,\nrecommended governments be allowed to impose tougher ratios\nunilaterally if a common framework can\u2019t be agreed upon.  According to Larsen, countries can\u2019t risk holding\nthemselves and their financial systems\u2019 integrity hostage to\ndevelopments in regions still struggling under a sovereign debt\ncrisis. Recommendations by a Danish government-backed Sifi\ncommittee for as much as 5 percent additional capital \u201care\nbalanced,\u201d he said. Europe has yet to complete its too-big-to-fail bank proposal.  The rift over bank regulation mirrors a similar division\namong central bankers after the euro area surfaced from its\nlongest recession on record.  Former JPMorgan Chase & Co. trader Javier Martin-Artajo was\narrested in Madrid as part of a probe into last year\u2019s $6.2\nbillion trading loss.  He turned himself in this morning after being contacted by\ninvestigators, a Spanish police official said today. Police have\npassed his case to the National Court in Madrid.  \u201cThe arrested person is presumed responsible for\nmanipulating and inflating the value of positions in the\nsynthetic credit portfolio of his firm with the aim of achieving\nspecific objectives of daily losses and gains,\u201d police said in\na statement.  The U.S. earlier this month charged Martin-Artajo, a\nSpanish citizen, and Julien Grout, a French citizen, with trying\nto hide losses that ultimately cost JPMorgan more than $6.2\nbillion last year. Both men face as long as 20 years in prison\nif convicted of the most serious counts, including conspiracy\nand wire fraud.  Martin-Artajo\u2019s lawyer, Lista Cannon, didn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to a telephone call seeking comment. Jennifer\nZuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan declined\nto comment.  Rheinmetall AG and Atlas Elektronik GmbH, a unit jointly\nowned by ThyssenKrupp AG and European Aeronautic Defence and\nSpace Co., were raided as part of a German probe into\nallegations of bribery by employees.  The suspects are being investigated over payments to Greek\nofficials from 1998 to 2011 to win contracts for submarine\nequipment, Frank Passade, a spokesman for the prosecutors\u2019\noffice in Bremen, Germany, said in an interview yesterday.\nAtlas, a naval electronics manufacturer, allegedly paid 8.5\nmillion euros ($11.4 million) in bribes and Dusseldorf-based\nRheinmetall, an armored vehicle maker, paid 9.1 million euros,\nPassade said.  \u201cAtlas informed us in 2010 about the matter, but at the\ntime the facts indicated that we didn\u2019t have jurisdiction since\neverything happened abroad,\u201d Passade said. \u201cTax investigators\ninspecting Rheinmetall\u2019s books last year brought new aspects to\nlight prompting us to open a probe.\u201d  The companies confirmed the raids. Oliver Hoffmann, a\nspokesman for Rheinmetall, said the allegations are baseless.\nAtlas, based in Bremen, is cooperating with the probe, said\nSteffen Leuthold, a spokesman for the company.  UBS AG, Switzerland\u2019s largest bank, will pay $4.58 million\nto settle an investigation by regulators into whether its sales\nassistants were licensed in states where they did business.  UBS\u2019s \u201cclient service associates\u201d took orders without\nhaving the required state registrations, according to a\nstatement yesterday by the New Jersey Bureau of Securities,\nwhich said it led the case. The Zurich-based bank didn\u2019t admit\nor deny the allegations.  \u201cOver a six-year period, UBS failed to recognize a flaw\nin its order entry systems that allowed unregistered persons to\naccept customer orders,\u201d Abbe R. Tiger, the New Jersey agency\u2019s\nchief, said in the statement.  UBS\u2019s sales assistants also weren\u2019t adequately supervised,\nNew Jersey regulators said. Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill\nLynch brokerage settled a similar state investigation in 2009.  \u201cUBS is pleased to have resolved this legacy registration\nissue which involved unsolicited orders,\u201d Gregg Rosenberg, a\nUBS spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.

Donald Trump was sued by New York Attorney General Eric\nSchneiderman over claims the billionaire operated a fraudulent\nonline educational institute that swindled students out of $40\nmillion.  Trump University, now known as the Trump Entrepreneur\nInitiative, operated as an unlicensed educational institution\nand misled students with promises that they would gain real\nestate investing expertise, according a copy of the petition\nprovided by Schneiderman\u2019s office. The Aug. 24 filing wasn\u2019t\nimmediately available from New York Supreme Court in Manhattan.  Students paid as much as $35,000 for the institute\u2019s\nprograms, purportedly taught by experts \u201chandpicked\u201d by Trump,\naccording to the petition. After being told that they would\nrecoup the cost of the programs within a few months, many\nstudents were unable to conclude even one real estate deal.  \u201cMr. Trump used his celebrity status and personally\nappeared in commercials making false promises to convince people\nto spend tens of thousands of dollars they couldn\u2019t afford for\nlessons they never got,\u201d Schneiderman said in an Aug. 25\nstatement.  Trump, the New York-based Trump Organization Inc. and a\nformer president of the institute are accused of running an\nunlicensed educational institution from 2005 through 2011. More\nthan 5,000 students, including 600 in New York, paid for the\neducational programs, according to petition.  Amanda Miller, a Trump Organization spokeswoman, referred\nquestions to www.98percentapproval.com, a website devoted to\ncriticism of the attorney general.  The case is Schneiderman v. The Trump Entrepreneur\nInitiative LLC, 400965-2012, Supreme Court of the State of New\nYork, County of New York (Manhattan).  Ousted Politburo member Bo Xilai remained defiant as his\ncorruption trial ended with prosecutors calling for a severe\npunishment, in a case the Communist Party called proof of its\ndetermination to target high-level graft.  Bo accused his former police chief, who testified at the\ntrial in the eastern Chinese city of Jinan, of being in love\nwith his wife as he again asserted his innocence of the bribery,\nembezzlement and power-abuse charges against him. The bribery\nclaim was something \u201ceven the lousiest TV drama scriptwriter\nwouldn\u2019t create,\u201d he said.  Bo\u2019s rebuttals concluded a five-day trial, in which the\ncourt posted transcripts online, an unprecedented move that\nstate media called evidence of the proceedings\u2019 transparency.  Bo, a former commerce minister, governor and mayor, was\naccused of taking more than 21 million yuan ($3.4 million),\nembezzling 5 million yuan and covering up his wife Gu Kalai\u2019s\nrole in the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood. Once a\nrising political star, Bo\u2019s downfall in March last year posed\nthe biggest crisis to the Communist Party since the 1989\nTiananmen Square protests.  Bo insisted during his trial that while he made mistakes in\nhis career, he didn\u2019t commit any crimes, according to\ntranscripts released by the court in Jinan.  He sought to discredit those who testified against him,\ncalling his wife crazy, comparing a former businessman in Dalian\nto a wild biting dog and saying his former police chief in the\ncity of Chongqing, Wang Lijun, had lied.  Prosecutors said the facts are clear and the evidence is\nsufficient that Bo is guilty of all charges, according to a\nposting on the court\u2019s microblog.  The official Xinhua News Agency said the verdict would be\nannounced at a date still to be decided.  Two men who were employed by Flow Traders were charged in\nNew York with stealing the firm\u2019s electronic trading software by\ne-mailing it to themselves from their work accounts.  Glen Cressman, a trader at the New York office of the\nAmsterdam-based company, sent e-mails to himself in December\n2012 with trading strategies and valuation algorithms, according\nto the complaint in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.

Jason Vuu, a Flow Traders employee until his resignation in\nMarch, was charged with 20 counts of the same offenses. His e-mails were sent from August 2011 to August 2012, and he\nsometimes changed the file format of the attachments to make it\ndifficult to recognize their contents, according to the\ncomplaint.

Andrew Michael Jones, Gary Davis and Peter Phillip Nash were charged in a federal indictment unsealed today in Manhattan with helping Ross William Ulbricht, the alleged mastermind of Silk Road, to maintain the site. \u201cDuring its more than 2 1/2 years in operation, Silk road was used by several thousand drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to well over 100,0000 thousand buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from these unlawful transactions,\u201d prosecutors said in the indictment. Ulbricht, who was allegedly known online as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d was arrested in October and charged with running Silk Road, where anonymous users paid Bitcoin digital currency for illegal drugs, malicious software designed for computer hackers and other illegal products. He\u2019s being held without bail. While arguing against his release on bail, prosecutors in New York said he tried to arrange the murder of six people to protect his business. The government claims Jones and Davis worked as site administrators for Silk Road. Nash was the primary moderator on Silk Road discussion forums, prosecutors said. Ulbricht paid his site administrators and forum moderators salaries ranging from $50,000 to $75,000 a year, according to the government. The three men are charged with one count each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. Jones was arrested yesterday in Charles City, Virginia. Davis, of Ireland, was arrested in that country yesterday. Nash was arrested in Brisbane, Australia.

Mark Karpeles submitted his resignation from the board of directors at Bitcoin Foundation, according to a statement posted on its website by Jon Matonis, the group\u2019s executive director. Karpeles\u2019 resignation is the latest setback for Mt. Gox, one of the first exchanges for the currency, after it froze withdrawals earlier this month, citing technical difficulties. Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen said on Feb. 10 that the exchange was to blame for the faults and it should be able to fix them on its own. Mt. Gox Bitcoin holders offered the digital money for as little as $151 today, down from $290 late yesterday, according to the company\u2019s website. The currency is trading at $560 on London-based Bitstamp. Calls and e-mails to Tibanne Co., the Tokyo-based parent of Mt. Gox that is also headed by Karpeles, weren\u2019t immediately answered. Mt. Gox said this month that it identified a bug that enables people to withdraw the same Bitcoins more than once, leaving it vulnerable to hackers. It\u2019s still working to resume Bitcoin withdrawals for clients, the exchange said in a statement on Feb. 20. \u201cThe issues that Mt.

Ross William Ulbricht, who the U.S. said ran the \u201cSilk Road Hidden Website\u201d from January 2011 until last month, was known as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d or \u201cDPR,\u201d after a character in the 1987 film \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d Manhattan federal prosecutors said he operated \u201cthe most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet.\u201d Ulbricht, who was also indicted in federal court in Maryland for allegedly trying to arrange the murder of an employee he feared would become a witness against him. He could face life in prison if he\u2019s convicted in New York. Federal agents seized Silk Road, along with Bitcoins worth $3.6 million, and shut down the site today, according to Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Ulbricht was arrested yesterday in San Francisco, and made his initial appearance today in federal court there. \u201cThe site has sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the Internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites,\u201d the government said in a civil forfeiture complaint unsealed today in Manhattan. The price of Bitcoins listed on the exchange Bitstamp Ltd. fell as much as 22 percent today. Bitcoins\u2019 price has been unstable for months, plunging by more than 70 percent in the spring to about $60. The latest drop is one of the sharpest in the virtual currency\u2019s history. The legal documents made public today provide a window into an enterprise that, according to the government, generated more than a billion dollars in illicit sales and took in $80 million in commissions in less than three years. Electronic communications reviewed by federal agents show Ulbricht handled the routine personnel matters faced by any small-business man at the same time he was taking out a contract to kill one of his employees, prosecutors said. Ulbricht is the John Gotti of cybercrime, said a spokeswoman for the FBI in New York, referring to the late New York City organized crime boss. She declined to be identified because the investigation is continuing. Ulbricht graduated from the University of Texas with a physics degree in 2006, according to the complaint. He then attended graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania School of Materials Science and Engineering from 2006 to 2010. DPR employed a small staff of administrators, whom he paid an average of $1,000 to $2,000 a week to help operate the site, FBI Agent Christopher Tarbell said in the complaint against Ulbricht. The administrators filed weekly reports on their activities, asked him for guidance in dealing with user inquiries and sought permission before taking leave. Prosecutors in Maryland claim Ulbricht tried to have one of his administrators killed to prevent him from talking to police. In January, Ulbricht communicated with an undercover federal agent posing as a drug trafficker, saying the employee, who was not identified in the indictment unsealed today, had stolen money from Silk Road users and had been arrested. \u201cI\u2019d like him beat up, then forced to send the bitcoins he stole back,\u201d Ulbricht allegedly said in a message. \u201cLike sit him down at his computer and make him do it.\u201d Later, Ulbricht asked the undercover agent: \u201cCan you change the order to execute rather than torture?\u201d according to the indictment. Ulbricht paid $80,000 for the employee\u2019s murder, saying he feared the employee would give information to law enforcement, according to prosecutors. The undercover agent sent Ulbricht a staged photograph to make it appear the employee had been murdered, they said. \u201cI\u2019m pissed I had to kill him\u2026 but what\u2019s done is done,\u201d Ulbricht said, according to the indictment. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe he was so stupid\u2026. I just wish more people had some integrity.\u201d Ulbricht ran Silk Road on \u201cThe Onion Router\u201d or \u201cTor\u201d network, an Internet network designed to hide the identities of users by making it almost impossible to identify computers used to access or host websites, prosecutors said. On Sept. 23, Silk Road had almost 13,000 listings for illegal drugs, under categories including cannabis, dissociatives, ecstasy, intoxicants, opioids, precursors, psychedelics and stimulants, according to the complaint. Under its \u201cservices\u201d heading, users could hire computer hackers, buy instructions for hacking cash machines or obtain a list of black-market contacts to get anonymous bank accounts, counterfeit money, guns, stolen credit card information and hit men. A \u201cseller\u2019s guide\u201d on the site advised users to vacuum seal packages containing drugs to avoid detection by police dogs and drug-detection machines. On Aug. 5, 2011, DPR notified users of a new category of illegal items for sale on the site. \u201cWe are happy to announce a new category in the marketplace called forgeries,\u201d he said in a message posted on the site. \u201cIn this category, you will find offers for forged, government issued documents including fake IDs and passports.\u201d Silk Road required users to make purchases from Bitcoin accounts on the site. The virtual currency is used like cash to buy goods and services on the Internet. While Bitcoins are used for legitimate purposes, prosecutors said they are also popular with criminals who want to launder money or hide illegal transactions. Beginning in November 2011, undercover agents made more than 100 drug purchases, including ecstasy, cocaine, heroin and LSD, from Silk Road vendors, according to the complaint. In March, a Silk Road vendor known as FriendlyChemist told DPR through the site\u2019s private message system that he had a list of the real names and addresses of Silk Road vendors and customers, which he obtained by hacking into the computer of another vendor, according to the complaint. FriendlyChemist threatened that he would publish the information on the Internet unless DPR paid him $500,000, which he said he needed to pay off his drug suppliers. DPR corresponded with a Silk Road user called redandwhite who said he represented the people owed money by FriendlyChemist. \u201cIn my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn\u2019t mind if he was executed,\u201d DPR said March 27, according to the complaint. DPR provided FriendlyChemist\u2019s name and address in White Rock, British Columbia, with \u201cWife +3 kids.\u201d DPR later paid $150,000 to redandwhite to have FriendlyChemist killed, according to the complaint. Tarbell said Canadian law enforcement authorities had no record of any Canadian resident with the name DPR passed on to redandwhite nor any record of a homicide in White Rock at the time. Ulbricht wasn\u2019t charged in this second alleged murder-for-hire scheme. In the New York case, Ulbricht is charged with narcotics-trafficking conspiracy, computer-hacking conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy. Maryland federal prosecutors charged him with conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, attempted murder of a witness and using interstate commerce facilities in commission of murder-for-hire. He made an initial appearance in a five-minute proceeding today in federal court in San Francisco. Ulbricht said he can\u2019t afford an attorney and was assigned a federal public defender. He remains in custody. The criminal case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 13-mg-023287; the civil forfeiture case is U.S. v.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore will require intermediaries that facilitate the exchange of digital currencies to verify customers\u2019 identities and report suspicious transactions to a unit of the city-state\u2019s police, it said in a statement yesterday. No timeframe was given. Digital currencies have come under scrutiny in markets from China to Russia and the U.S., with some regulators calling for bans or limits on their use. Charlie Shrem, the founder of exchange company BitInstant, was charged in Manhattan two months ago with conspiring to launder $1 million of Bitcoins. He has denied the allegations. \u201cConsumers and businesses should take note of the broader risks that dealing in virtual currencies entails and should exercise the necessary caution,\u201d MAS Deputy Managing Director Ong Chong Tee said in yesterday\u2019s statement. In December, China\u2019s central bank barred financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions following a surge in the currency\u2019s value. Mt. Gox, a Japanese exchange operator, collapsed last month following the loss of Bitcoins valued at more than $500 million. The digital currency was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has since gained traction with merchants around the world. Bitcoins have no central issuing authority and use a public ledger to verify transactions. The new rules would make Singapore one of the first countries to target the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing among agents of virtual currencies, MAS said. Existing laws in Hong Kong already cover acts of fraud and money laundering involving \u201cvirtual commodities,\u201d the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in an e-mailed statement today. Virtual currency intermediaries in Singapore will be subject to the similar rules that govern money changers and remittance businesses, MAS said yesterday. The rules won\u2019t cover the \u201csafety and soundness\u201d of the intermediaries or the transactions, it said. The authority said it will monitor regulations in other jurisdictions and consider additional measures to address the risks posed by virtual currencies and their intermediaries. \u201cThis really sets Singapore out as the global leader of virtual-currency regulation,\u201d said Antony Lewis, head of business development at itBit Pte, a Singapore-based virtual currencies exchange. \u201cAs less professional outfits engaged in questionable activities are regulated out of the market, consumers win.\u201d Mt.

The exchange applied for bankruptcy protection three days later, saying it had lost 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers and 100,000 of its own. Bitcoins were trading at $637.83, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index showed as of 10:23 a.m. in Hong Kong. The value has almost halved from its December peak. Japan\u2019s government said March 7 that while Bitcoin isn\u2019t a currency, it could be subject to taxation like goods and services. It issued the statement in response to questions from opposition lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo, who has since asked the administration to clarify how it will regulate Bitcoin. A day before Mt.

Clownish \u201970s outfits; vinyl album covers from all over the globe; booths in which visitors record themselves singing along with the band; and a replica of the remote island cottage at which Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson wrote some of the group\u2019s biggest hits. It\u2019s all here.\xa0But fans should take heed: Tickets for the museum cannot be purchased with cash. In recent years, Ulvaeus has become concerned about the hidden social and economic costs of cash money, so much so that he decided to do something about it. With the museum\u2019s no-cash policy, media interviews, opinion writing, and a few pointed questions aimed at the country\u2019s central bank, Ulvaeus is doing his part to make Sweden the world\u2019s first cashless country. \u201cThe concept of money is really a very abstract one,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need that physical thing attached to it, I don\u2019t think. Not in 2014 and beyond.\u201d Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- At the ABBA Museum in Stockholm, visitors are refused entry if they try to pay with cash. That's because Bjorn Ulvaeus, former frontman for the band, has made it his personal mission to lead the way to a cashless Sweden, with hope that the rest of the world will follow. Video by: Jennafer Savino, Justin Beach. (Source: Bloomberg)  Ulvaeus first began thinking critically about cash after his son\u2019s apartment was burgled and burgled again. No one was harmed, but Ulvaeus wondered about the downstream economics of criminal enterprises such as robbery. Eliminating cash obviously wouldn\u2019t end crime. But wouldn\u2019t it remove the underlying incentive for street crime? \u201cFunnily enough, no one has ever given me a really good answer to that question,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just discard it and say, \u2018Well they [criminals] will think of something else.\u2019 Well I say, \u2018What? What will they think of? Exactly what will they do?\u2019\u201d At the minimum, he would like to see some empirical analysis of what going cashless would do to the underworld economy, or even what would happen if just high-value banknotes were curtailed. His arguments aren\u2019t especially new. Scores of institutions, companies, and even governments have begun an incremental offensive against physical money, nudging it closer to obsolescence. Earlier this year in Israel, a special commission headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff outlined a three-step plan for the country to do away with notes and coins. Japan and South Korea are always in the vanguard of new payment technologies, while Kenya\u2019s blockbuster success with mobile transfer service M-Pesa continues to dazzle development wonks and economists alike. And then there is Apple Pay. Even so, if odds makers were to accept wagers on the first country to completely do away with cash, Sweden wouldn\u2019t be a bad bet. With almost 10 million people, its own currency, and one of the most wired populations in the world, Sweden is the perfect laboratory for new technologies and frank talk about the cashless future. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had expressions like \u2018cash is king,\u2019 so it\u2019s culturally acceptable,\u201d says Henrik Bergman, senior manager and transactions specialist at\xa0Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.  Even without a deliberate government policy to phase out physical money, things are still headed in an exclusively digital direction, albeit not as swiftly as some aging pop stars might demand. Small-value coins are an endangered species in Sweden.\xa0Checks have long been eliminated. Stores in downtown Stockholm post signs saying, \u201cWe Don\u2019t Take Cash\u2014Cards Only.\u201d Churches have installed card\xa0terminals for donations, and many banks now keep no cash on hand. The outgoing head of Sveriges Riksbank, Sweden\u2019s central bank, has argued for years that society has been cheated by cash for too long, thanks to security, transportation, and production expenses, as well as less-direct costs such as tax evasion. Meanwhile, a number of local startups are pushing new ways to pay, or otherwise bypass the need for cash. There is banking startup Tink, which already has more than 200,000 users and has no real-world presence. A consortium of the country\u2019s major banks launched a service called Swish that enables real-time transfer between accounts; in less than two years they have drawn 1.7 million customers. And payments service IZettle, sometimes referred to as the Square of Europe, is one of the fastest-growing companies on the continent.   Ulvaeus cringes at the suggestion that he is a crusader. He prefers \u201ccurious citizen,\u201d and he does a decent job not sounding like the cashless thing has lit a fire within his soul. Yet he is genuinely irritated by cash\u2019s staying power. In an essay he penned for the museum website, for instance, he writes: \u201cI challenge anyone to come up with reasons to keep cash that outweigh the enormous benefits of getting rid of it.\u201d When presented with some possible reasons, he has replies at the ready. On privacy: \u201c\u2026Obviously electronic money leaves an electronic trail. But then my counter-question is, \u2018What is it that you absolutely want to use cash for? What is it that you actually want to buy with cash that you do not want to buy with a card?\u2019 And people squirm and can\u2019t think of anything because most people have nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d Besides, he says, surely there will be some way to transact anonymously. (See: Bitcoin.) What about the criticism that electronic money benefits the rich? Ulvaeus says that sticking up for and maintaining cash is a way of ignoring or deferring more systemic problems. \u201cPeople ask me, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t we keep cash to have something to give to beggars?\u2019 It\u2019s the wrong question! It\u2019s a social issue,\u201d he says. What we should be doing is addressing the fact that there are homeless people to begin with, not defending the coins we occasionally drop into their cups. The same is true for people who think rectangular slips of paper promote more responsible financial behavior. \u201cFor developing countries, there might be even more benefits to going cashless than for Sweden,\u201d he adds. In poorer countries, \u201cit must be such a benefit for the economy if the women keep digital money, and there is never any [physical] money that the men can steal and go to the bar with.\u201d As for the inevitable question about a massive power outage that would render all our digital devices useless, blocking access to our funds, Ulvaeus is unfazed. \u201cIf that doomsday scenario happens, will it help if you have heaps of paper money? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Ulvaeus suspects our loyalty to cash and reluctance to consider doing away with it are rooted in nostalgia. \u201cI cannot explain it any other way than it must be for sentimental reasons,\u201d he says. We are used to what we\u2019re used to, to what we grew up with, and such powerful emotions are not easily undone. It\u2019s not so unlike people who come to ABBA The Museum to look back into the \u201970s and remember what life was like back then, he says. \u201cI think that should be the future of [physical] money\u2014in a museum.\u201d", 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-28/abbas-bj-rn-ulvaeus-does-his-part-to-make-sweden-cashless', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 10, 29, 22, 18, 12, 379000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"An ABBA Star's Campaign for a 100% Cash-Free Sweden"}, {'articleText': u' When it comes to the merits of Bitcoin, even the tech community is still on the fence. Coming into a debate about the decentralized digital currency at Bloomberg\u2019s Next Big Thing Summit on Tuesday, an audience poll found 60 percent of attendees predicted the virtual currency\u2014priced at $105 during the session\u2014wouldn\u2019t be worth $500 in five years. By the time Ribbit Capital founder Micky Malka and Jim Rickards of Tangent Capital were done speaking 25 minutes later, however, about the same percentage felt that Bitcoin would exceed $500 in that time. On the pro side was Malka, a longtime fan of the cryptocurrency and a venture capitalist focused on disrupting the financial-services space. Playing the skeptic: Rickards, who wrote Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis. While Rickards appealed to logic by arguing that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t offer the stability or safety of a central bank-backed currency, Malka effectively compared it to other units of value that can be transferred between peers, such as frequent-flier points. But the debate, adeptly moderated by SurveyMonkey Chief Executive Officer Dave Goldberg, also showed why Bitcoin\u2019s merits\u2014anonymity, decentralization, lack of regulation\u2014could be its downfall. The reason: government intervention. Although Bitcoin\u2019s frothy ecosystem may be relatively small, its undeniable value to criminals has put it high on the agenda of regulators. Drug dealers, sex traffickers, and thieves are constantly seeking methods of payment that allow them to pocket their illicit proceeds in peace. That\u2019s why Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara recently shut down Liberty Reserve and charged the online exchange\u2019s founders with operating a laundering service for more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds. In other words, as Bharara put it, \u201ca black market bank.\u201d While Bitcoin hasn\u2019t yet earned that level of rhetoric, it has the same ability to mask transactions. And Rickards pointed to another potential trouble spot: taxes. Anyone who buys Bitcoin at $100 and uses it to buy $110 worth of goods is technically supposed to report that $10 in gains to the government. It\u2019s a safe bet that few, if any, Bitcoin users do. Why bother, when both buyer and seller are anonymous? Even Bitcoin\u2019s creator, who operates under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, remains unknown. With Bitcoin values producing wild gains and losses for its users, that has caught the attention of tax authorities, too. For most, the debate remains a cerebral one. When asked who owned the currency itself, only a few hands in the audience went up. Even Goldberg, though officially neutral, reiterated concerns about deflation in a market where most of the users are betting on its value to rapidly rise. So why did some skeptics switch sides? Look to the debaters themselves. While Rickards focused on tactical issues like legal blowback and regulatory issues, Malka looked at what Bitcoin could be. As he pointed out, the derision now being piled on Bitcoin echoes the warnings about cyberspace back in 1992. Two decades later, we\u2019ve learned to love the Internet and deal with risks like child pornography\u2014in large part by having the tools to track offenders.

But those in the park relied on relatively new cellular connections to do so. The future Fenway Park will offer fans Wi-Fi to accomplish the same thing. To be clear, Fenway has Wi-Fi now, says Red Sox IT Director Steve Conley, but most of that capacity is soaked up by \u201cback of office stuff\u201d\u2014press boxes, in-seat services, and the ticket gates. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky proposition ,but every stadium will be a hotspot. It\u2019s just a matter of when and how easy it will be,\u201d Conley tells us. Two years ago, the Red Sox installed Verizon Wireless\u2019s distributed antenna system (DAS) technology to accommodate all those smartphone tweeters in the stands, but even putting in that gear\u2014and the Meru Networks routers for Wi-Fi\u2014was a challenge for a ballpark that\u2019s on the National Register of Historic Places. Conley has likened finding spots for all these connectivity points to an Easter egg hunt; if you\u2019ve ever been to the crooked interior warrens of the park, you know what he means. \u201cWith these things, we just put them in a NEMA box and paint \u2018em green and find a place for them,\u201d Conley says. The Red Sox\u2019 IT problem is not unique. Many companies are located in older buildings, constrained by their own walls and their environs. Face it: Even if the Red Sox did want to expand Fenway, the Mass Pike and Brookline Avenue that border its walls are fairly immovable objects. Given the space limitation, smart use of existing real estate for IT is very important. That was apparent back in 2007 and 2008, when the Red Sox computer room sat behind the ticket office. \u201cWe were renovating and our need for technology kept growing, [but] it was clear we didn\u2019t have adequate power or cooling\u2014this is a 100-year-old building,\u201d Conley says. Something had to give. They sought alternatives for the IT build-out. Even though Conley is a \u201cself-described server-hugger\u201d who really did not want to put any IT off-premises, it was pretty clear that had to happen. After checking out co-lo and data centers in and near Boston, the Red Sox decided to go with the Markley Group, with its shiny, expansive facilities atop the old Jordan Marsh (now Macy\u2019s) store a few miles away, in Downtown Crossing. \u201cThey blew us away. There was no way we could come close to what they provide, so my reluctance went away pretty quickly after researching the project and assessing the costs,\u201d Conley says. The Red Sox still run that old computer server room and some on-premises applications\u2014Microsoft Dynamics GP (Great Plains) CRM and EMC Syncplicity for advanced scouting video\u2014but most core services run out of Markley. As of now, the team isn\u2019t using Markley\u2019s new cloud-based services, but that\u2019s always an option, Conley says . A further benefit of going with Markley or any peering center is that all the major telcos and pipes are there already, making for easy and fast interconnection to a variety of services. The team also outsources a bunch of its other big workloads\u2014Major League Baseball Advanced Media handles all its website-related stuff and Tickets.com deals with the ticket sales. But when it comes to dealing with internal IT in a creaky, sometimes-flukey building packed on good days with 37,000-plus screaming Red Sox fans eager to vent electronically, Conley knows all-too-well that internal IT still carries the load. \nAlso from GigaOM:\n Taking the Game out of Game Consoles (subscription required) \nIslamist Hacker Publishes Access Details for Thousands of Twitter Accounts\n \nFeds Seized $2.9M in Bitcoin Funds From Mt.

There, I said it. In my opinion, Facebook is ignoring a big opportunity at the very broad inexpensive base of the handset market. If it were to create a cheap feature phone optimized for its own services, it would not only become more dominant in mobile, but also would further solidify its role as the world\u2019s social network of record. First, let me say I\u2019m not one of those people who thinks that every brand or tech darling needs its own hardware. I think the idea of an Amazon smartphone is silly and a Twitter phone even sillier. I believe there\u2019s limited appeal for a specialty Xbox or Nintendo gaming handset. And I feel the short unhappy lives of virtual carriers ESPN Mobile and Disney Mobile show that the market has little use for devices built around a specific company\u2019s content. All of these companies are better served by offering up their content and services through an open application environment. In his very astute analysis post on Wednesday, my colleague Kevin Tofel claims the same logic applies to Facebook: It can much more easily and much more efficiently extend its reach through software, rather than hardware. I agree with Kevin, but only up to a point. I think Kevin is right that Facebook has no business creating its own smartphone. People buy smartphones for flexibility, and they\u2019re paying for the privilege of not being tied down to a specific set of services or apps. A feature phone, however, is a much different animal. A feature phone is a much more rigid device, built over proprietary software and designed to do a few things\u2014and only those few things. There are still billions of people around the world buying feature phones, and they\u2019re not approaching those devices with any smartphone expectations. They essentially want a communication device, and Facebook is perfectly positioned to deliver that communication capability in spades. Unlike say an Amazon or a Disney, Facebook\u2019s whole business model is built around the idea of social communication. With Facebook\u2019s suite of apps services, you can IM; e-mail; share photos, videos, links, and updates; coordinate activities; and even make phone calls. While most social networks or over-the-top communications apps are limited by the size of their networks, Facebook doesn\u2019t have that limitation. Apart from the telephone grid and e-mail, with 1.06 billion active daily users Facebook is probably the largest communications network in the world. And for many people Facebook has become their de facto communications network. I haven\u2019t gotten an e-mail from my younger sister in years. If she wants to contact me, she pings me on Facebook. The point I\u2019m trying to make is that many people have chosen to make Facebook the organ by which they communicate with the world. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good thing, but it\u2019s certainly something Facebook could capitalize on. I would argue there\u2019s already a substantial crossover between likely feature phone buyers and Facebook junkies\u2014teenagers, for instance\u2014but Facebook could further broaden that mutual appeal. There are still plenty of people in the U.S. who are uncomfortable with the idea of the mobile Internet, but are perfectly comfortable using Facebook online. They would embrace a Facebook-centric phone as a way to ease into mobile data (think of it as a \u201cgateway phone\u201d). Parents giving their younger children their first Internet-capable handset might be much more comfortable with a device that hosted a single social network, over which they could easily keep tabs on their activities. Facebook is growing like wildfire in developing markets where few people can afford a smartphone or have regular access to a PC. A cheap Facebook phone would be ideal for their needs. Many more people would simply be attracted to such a device\u2019s cheapness. A free or sub-$50 device that comes with a cheap data plan and a core social networking service you\u2019re already well familiar with\u2014that\u2019s tough to ignore. Facebook has already started pursuing a cautious form of this strategy. It\u2019s working with mobile chipmaker Spreadtrum to pre-optimize its software for the cheapest Android handsets. If Facebook made its own inexpensive phone, though, it would exert considerable influence in the market. Carriers would be eager to carry any Facebook-branded device, so Zuckerberg and team could negotiate specialty data plans for their members. Orange and Facebook are already experimenting with this concept in some European countries, exempting social network traffic from the usual data caps. The company could also optimize any Facebook device for its own advertising, kicking off its still-nascent mobile monetization strategy. If it made enough money through advertising it could even take a page from Amazon\u2019s book, subsidizing the cost of the phone or the cost of the mobile service, thus making its phone even more accessible. Ultimately the Facebook phone and the Facebook network would begin reinforcing one another. After a year or two of viewing the mobile Internet through the Facebook lens, a user might graduate to a full-fledged smartphone, but they would more than likely bring their dependence on Facebook\u2019s applications to the new device. Billions of people around the world will get their first exposure to the Internet through a mobile phone. If it can produce a cheap, attractive device, Facebook can ensure that exposure is through its portal. Getting into the hardware business isn\u2019t an easy thing to do, especially if your expertise is in software, but in Facebook\u2019s case it might be worth it. The more vested Facebook is in mobile, the stronger its social network becomes. You can argue all you like about how worthless a Facebook phone would be to you or your friends, and I would agree with you. I wouldn\u2019t buy a Facebook phone. I doubt you, as a GigaOM reader, would either. But I guarantee there would be millions of people who would. \nAlso from GigaOM:\n How to Compete With Facebook in 2013 (subscription required) \nYes, You Should Care About Bitcoin, and Here\u2019s Why\n \nWhat Airbnb Learned From Jiro Dreams of Sushi\n \nFacebook and Apple: It\u2019s Complicated\n \nWhen Cancer Stole Roger Ebert\u2019s Voice, Twitter Gave Him a New One\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-05/why-facebook-should-have-built-its-own-phone', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 4, 5, 16, 5, 3, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Why Facebook Should Have Built Its Own Phone'}, {'articleText': u' The virtual currency Bitcoin is all over the news these days\u2014in part for its volatility. If you can use it, or even understand why it has any value, you\u2019re in a small minority. There are all sorts of aspects to the \u201cmath-based\u201d virtual money that make it impractical for most people to use in everyday transactions, but its proponents are fanatical believers in its potential. Now some of Bitcoin\u2019s earliest evangelists and supporters have created what they say is a Bitcoin for the rest of us\u2014another digital currency, called Ripple, that, unlike Bitcoin, transfers easily into and out of other currencies from around the world. Today, OpenCoin, the company managing Ripple, is announcing new funding from some venerable Silicon Valley names like Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Founders Fund. It\u2019s also unveiling some ambitious goals. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a wacky libertarian to understand that trust in political currencies is eroding,\u201d says Chris Larsen, OpenCoin\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOur objective is to build a new global currency.\u201d Larsen has been trying to push the financial-services industry into the digital age for the last 20 years. In the 1990s he started eLoan, one of the first online mortgage companies, and in 2006 founded the Prosper Marketplace, the first peer-to-peer lending company in the U.S. \u201cFinance hasn\u2019t changed very much since the Internet was created,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy does it cost so much to move money around? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Ripple, he says, attacks that problem: It\u2019s a virtual currency with no interchange fees that enables fast payments to merchants and between consumers. Larsen says that Ripple\u2014the company bought the URL from a Grateful Dead fan\u2014has one big advantage over Bitcoin. In many cases it can take a long time for Bitcoin transactions to clear because coins have to be \u201cmined,\u201d a computationally intensive process that involves sifting through large amounts of data to find numerical patterns that confirm the transaction is legitimate. OpenCoin maintains a single global ledger; transactions are confirmed as the network\u2019s servers automatically check the ledger. The process takes about 10 seconds, the company says. Of course, with Bitcoin prone to big swings, the future of digital currencies still seems very much in question, but Larsen argues that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility underscores the need for Ripple. One reason the value of Bitcoins fell by $100 yesterday, according to reports, is that its largest marketplace, Mt.Gox, was under a denial-of-service attack and couldn\u2019t satisfy orders fast enough. Ripple, he points out, doesn\u2019t require such centralized servers; it is completely decentralized. A few Ripples are already in circulation\u2014OpenCoin did an initial giveaway to Bitcoin enthusiasts\u2014and trade at almost 1,000 per $1 on Bitstamp, a Bitcoin exchange. Starting today, OpenCoin will begin to seed a broader market by putting 100 billion Ripples in circulation: It will gradually distribute 50 billion to users who sign up on the site; it will hold the other 50 billion. (The company hopes its Ripple reserves will appreciate.) It is also introducing tools to manage the currency. On its website, people will be able to register for a Ripple account, monitor their balances, and send and receive payments. They can also exchange their Ripples for other currencies, including dollars and\u2014yep\u2014Bitcoin. One of the aspects of the Bitcoin mystique, of course, is the identity of its anonymous creator, who called himself \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto.\u201d The genesis of Ripple is no mystery: It was created by Jed McCaleb, a 38-year-old Berkeley dropout and, more important, the founder of the Mt.Gox Bitcoin marketplace. Some Internet users speculate that McCaleb is actually Nakamoto. McCaleb denies it; regardless, he developed Ripple with Arthur Britto, Stefan Thomas, and David Schwartz, all early contributors to the Bitcoin community and active members in the Bitcoin forums. In this light, it\u2019s not a stretch to see Ripple as the Bitcoin community\u2019s second attempt at a potentially world-changing concept\u2014a virtual global currency, backed not by central governments but by the animating notions behind the Internet itself. McCaleb says he always found Bitcoin difficult to promote to other people. \u201cIf it gets big, there will be a huge waste of resources spent on mining. It\u2019s totally unnecessary and it will just get worse as the system gets bigger. I wanted a system that didn\u2019t need that.\u201d He says Ripple \u201cis just a better iteration.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/BradStone', 'name': u'Brad Stone', 'twitterhandle': u'BradStone'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-11/introducing-ripple-a-bitcoin-copycat', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 4, 11, 11, 51, 30, 352000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Introducing Ripple, a Bitcoin Copycat'}, {'articleText': u' Sure, Thanksgiving is about getting together with the family and all that, but let\u2019s face it: It\u2019s also about greed.

The preferred currency of online drug dealers, it\u2019s just beginning to become a bit more mainstream. Folks such as Richard Branson are talking about\xa0accepting\xa0Bitcoin for flights on Virgin America (or, soon, spaceflights on Virgin Galactic). Stores in Silicon Valley will let you buy a sandwich and sushi with the virtual currency. Each new level of visibility is likely to push the value of Bitcoin higher. Advocates of Bitcoin use liken the currency\u2019s position to the Internet in its early days. We\u2019re in the dial-up phase, they say\u2014you should buy in before the boom of all booms arrives. Please accept this note of pragmatic caution before you binge-buy Bitcoins over the long weekend. One tricky thing about the currency is that it requires regular attention. You can set up a Bitcoin wallet on your phone, with electronic keys the wallet app can regularly change for you. But that means you need to keep track of those keys by e-mailing copies of them to yourself or performing some other backup. If you lose your phone and your keys, you\u2019ve lost the money. Consider, too, stories like this one from the\xa0Guardian\xa0about a man named James Howells. He was an early Bitcoin miner, meaning that in exchange for the virtual currency, he used a computer to race other people for solutions to mathematical puzzles in Bitcoin\u2019s underlying mechanics. He\u2019d amassed a supply that would now be worth about $800,000, but accidentally threw out the hard drive where it was stored. Elsewhere, there are stories about viruses that scour your PC for Bitcoins. For this reason, experts recommend that you not store them on Windows computers without antivirus software and other protections.\xa0Consider yourself warned: If you feel like buying into Bitcoin, please take the necessary precautions and practice safe greed.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/valleyhack', 'name': u'Ashlee Vance', 'twitterhandle': u'valleyhack'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-27/bitcoin-buyers-beware-being-greedy-aint-easy', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 27, 21, 50, 23, 829000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Bitcoin Buyers Beware: Being Greedy Ain't Easy"}, {'articleText': u' Microsoft unveiled a raft of measures to counteract what it characterizes as the \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d of government snooping. It says these steps will \u201censure governments use legal process rather than technological brute force to access customer data.\u201d As has been previously reported, this will include more widespread use of encryption in the company\u2019s networks and systems. It also includes measures that specifically address the concerns of Microsoft\u2019s international public-sector and business customers. Notably, the company will expand its Government Security Program, which allows governments to inspect the company\u2019s source code so they can check that it doesn\u2019t include hidden backdoors for the benefit of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies. In a blog post, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said: Microsoft\u2019s name has popped up repeatedly in the months following Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations of global mass surveillance, mostly carried out by the Americans, British, and Australians. The company allegedly provided U.S. agencies with early warnings of vulnerabilities in its software before it patches those flaws, in theory giving those agencies a window of opportunity to exploit them. It also reportedly worked directly alongside the National Security Agency to help the spies circumvent some of the encryption protecting its online communications services. Now, as signs emerge that the NSA scandal is threatening the revenue of U.S. tech vendors, Microsoft is trying to get back in the world\u2019s good books. First up is that \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d designation\u2014while it doesn\u2019t specifically call out the U.S. government, it does put such snooping in the same category as malware and \u201ccyber attacks.\u201d Then there\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s newfound urgency in applying encryption across its systems. This is essential for a company moving into the cloud, and indeed Smith noted that Microsoft already encrypts Outlook.com and Office 365 content when it\u2019s being passed between the company and its customers (of course, the Outlook.com encryption is the same encryption that Microsoft is alleged to have helped the NSA compromise). Windows Azure storage is also encrypted in transit. Here\u2019s what Smith promised on that front, characterizing it as an \u201cacceleration\u201d of Microsoft\u2019s encryption plans: Smith also moved to reassure government and business customers that Microsoft will try to tell them if and when agencies are after their data. \u201cWhere a gag order attempts to prohibit us from doing this, we will challenge it in court,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this successfully in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future to preserve our ability to alert customers when governments seek to obtain their data. And we\u2019ll assert available jurisdictional objections to legal demands when governments seek this type of customer content that is stored in another country.\u201d There has never been any conclusive evidence of backdoors existing in Windows or other Microsoft products, although rumors to that effect have circulated for years. There are certainly plenty of people in the tech industry\u2014even Linux creator Linus Torvalds\u2014who have been asked to insert backdoors in their products, though of course those who admit as much also say they turned the authorities down. \nAlso from Gigaom\n Storefront: E-Commerce (subscription required) \nToyTalk Pushes Boundaries with Conversational Entertainment (Too Bad It\u2019s Just For Kids)\n \nBitcoin Stumbles As Chinese Government Tells Banks to Stay Away from It\n \nPlex for Chromecast: New Clues Hint at Imminent Launch\n \nJudge Throws Out Google Privacy Policy, Notes \u201cUsers Are the Real Product\u201d\n', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-05/microsoft-unveils-encryption-to-counter-snooping-and-reassure-clients', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 5, 18, 0, 31, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Microsoft's Encryption Race"}, {'articleText': u' From recent highs of $1,240, Bitcoin plunged as much as 30 percent, to $870, early on Dec. 5, after China\u2019s central bank announced regulations forbidding financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions. The U.S. Federal Reserve has no plans to regulate Bitcoin. But former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan chimed in, calling Bitcoin a bubble in an interview yesterday on Bloomberg TV. By now, wild moves in the price of Bitcoin are to be expected. And unless this emerging asset class becomes a more stable reservoir or wealth, Bitcoin will continue to be viewed with suspicion among everyone but the most daring of speculators. China\u2019s new regulations come shortly after Bitcoin reached what was hailed as an important milestone: parity, of sorts, with gold. Its price in U.S. dollars on Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, briefly touched the $1,242 price of 1 troy ounce of gold around 12:30 a.m. on Friday. Bitcoin quickly fell away, but the two assets continued to dance closely to each other until today. \n  If the moment seemed to give Bitcoin any luster of maturity, it was illusory. In total value of outstanding units (and don\u2019t call it market cap), Bitcoin, cumulatively valued at $13 billion, is still dwarfed by the globe\u2019s $6.8 trillion worth of mined gold, according to estimates by precious metals consultancy GFMS. Those extant Bitcoins are currently worth about 10.5 million troy ounces of gold, putting it between the gold reserves of Venezuela (11.8 million troy ounces) and the U.K. (9.98 million troy ounces). Moreover, every exciting runup in price, or panicked selloff, is just another setback for Bitcoin\u2019s volatility, as Joshua Brustein wrote on Monday. Two years ago, Timothy Lee noted the irony that while Bitcoin goes to great lengths to avoid the volatility of supply-side inflation, algorithmically capping the supply at 21 million coins, it\u2019s been undermined by the volatility of demand. It may be useful as a pass-through between other currencies (some Chinese sidestep currency controls via Bitcoin), as Lee suggests, but holding the digital currency for any period of time is still more of a gamble than a convenience.   Meanwhile, now that many market-watchers have begun denominating charts in millibitcoins (currently at $1.06), the next arbitrary milestone might be parity with BlackBerry (BBRY, $6.14).', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-05/bitcoins-volatility-problem-why-todays-selloff-wont-be-the-last', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 5, 19, 11, 38, 304000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Bitcoin's Volatility Problem: Why Today's Selloff Won't Be the Last"}, {'articleText': u' Mention \u201cdeflation\u201d and the first thing people think of is the Great Depression of the 1930s. But the worst-ever deflation going on right now is in the Bitcoin world. It\u2019s not that Bitcoins are losing value; this year, Bitcoin is up 64-fold. As a result, prices of real things in terms of Bitcoins are plummeting. For this article, I created a Bitcoin Consumer Price Index1 that\u2019s the exact equivalent of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index. The only difference is that it measures prices of goods and services (from food to clothing to gasoline to haircuts) in terms of Bitcoins instead of dollars.   This is a great development if you own a lot of Bitcoins. But it would be a disaster if it were the official currency of the United States\u2014the coin of the realm, so to speak. Deflation is all about the buying power of a currency. It\u2019s not just prices of things people buy that fall in a generalized deflation. Wages and salaries also fall. So cheaper goods aren\u2019t really any cheaper in terms of your buying power. Two bad things happen in a deflation. First, people tend to postpone purchases as they wait for prices to get lower. That slows the economy to a crawl. Second, debts get more and more burdensome because they don\u2019t shrink the way everything else does. If you owed 1,000 Bitcoins before the deflation, you still owe 1,000 Bitcoins after it, only now your paycheck has shrunk by 98.5 percent. The only solution is to default. That\u2019s what happened on a massive scale in the Great Depression. The Bitcoin CPI is just another way of demonstrating that Bitcoin isn\u2019t remotely suited to becoming a real currency, as numerous economists have pointed out. Better to use it to buy a round\u2014or a hundred rounds\u2014at the local bar. 1I used data from coindesk.com, which synthesizes one price out of three online marketplaces.

Time and experience may prove it to be a more stable store of value than many fiat currencies.\u201d Last month, several people appeared before a U.S. Senate committee\xa0to defend bitcoin, among them Patrick Murck, general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation, responsible for the quote above. You can hear in Murck\u2019s testimony that jingling sense of Silicon Valley certainty that comes with the knowledge that this technology, unlike all the others, will be immune from the ravages of historical experience. Bitcoin is an extraordinary innovation. It also will never replace the dollar or the euro, what Murck refers to as \u201cfiat currencies.\u201d Fiat will win over bitcoin for the same reason it won over gold, silver, and copper in early modern Europe. Central banks, too, are a form of technology. Like other technologies, they\u2019ve improved with iteration. Since the establishment of Sweden\u2019s Riksbank at the end of the 17th century, central banks have been trying out new strategies, watching each other and copying what works. Fiat currency is not a unstable relic, waiting to be replaced with an innovation that prevents inflation. Fiat currency is a highly adapted tool. Inflation isn\u2019t a bug. It\u2019s a feature. There\u2019s a fight as old as money over who gets to determine what money is\u2014the state or the market. Generally, states claim the right to make money. Whether they can hold on to that right depends on how good they are at making money, but they have gotten better at it over time. Before central banks, kings minted coins, offering the public good of a verified metal content in exchange for a bit of seigniorage, an extra bit of value over the cost of the metal. When they debased the metal or demanded too much seigniorage, merchants figured it out and either melted the coins down or hoarded more reliable ones. Early banks issued credit in the form of private notes. This created both good and bad inflation. Credit grew with local economies, but sometimes outpaced it in the hands of an improvident bank. State-run central banks took over this function, in part, because it was a good privilege to have as a sovereign. It was also good for markets to have a sound but growing source of money. Money does three things. It serves as a unit of account; you can quote prices for common goods in dollars, as can all the other people in America. It serves as a store of value, as with the dollars in your bank account. And it serves as a medium of exchange; your grocery store takes dollars\u2014and so do you, from your employer. Bitcoin, like gold and silver, is finite, making it a good store of value. And it exchanges well\u2014magnificently, in fact, far better than gold. The way that the bitcoin protocol uses distributed computing power to verify transactions at a distance is an innovation that has been wanting since the first bills of exchange were offered in the long-distance Mediterranean sea trade. Bitcoin is a store of value and a medium of exchange. It\u2019s like really awesome gold. It\u2019s not, however, a unit of account. Your mother cannot quote you the price of eggs in bitcoin. This is not just a question of waiting long enough for your mom to get around to using bitcoin. The state has tremendous power over the unit of account. It pays government contracts in the unit of its choosing. It collects taxes in that unit, too.\xa0The psychological weight of this power can last for centuries. Medieval Europe still accounted for its variety of coins in Roman units. Modern Europe uses the metric system because Napoleon wanted it so. It\u2019s not clear why any state would choose to give this up. The Internet beat up publishing and a couple of other industries. It\u2019s having a harder time so far against the state.\xa0A currency is an asset with an army. Bitcoin has no army. And central banks have had several centuries of using this power to experiment with inflation. Sometimes it has worked. Often it has not. Inflation is not inherently good or bad. Bad inflation, as when a king wants to lessen debt, is bad. Good inflation helps money supply grow with the market.\xa0You can\u2019t generalize about fiat money any more than you can generalize about countries or companies. Some are run well. Others aren\u2019t. What matters is not the power to inflate but how it\u2019s used. The fiat currencies that have survived longest are run by stable democracies, with slightly differing views on interest rates but a rough consensus on innovations in sound money management. In his testimony, Murck suggested that bitcoin will provide a stable base of money supply, \u201cmaking a small central bank or currency bloc accountable if they poorly manage their portfolio, while at the same time ameliorating the economic effects of the central bank\u2019s mismanagement.\u201d This is a fine idea. So fine, in fact, that it has already been happening for a long time, with mixed results. People who live under poorly managed currencies already collect dollars and euros.\xa0The dollar, for example, has always been particularly popular in Argentina. Now bitcoin is popular there. The dollar has failed to inspire Argentina to take care of its peso. Bitcoin will fail, too. Bitcoin is a fascinating, elegant way to confirm financial transactions. That\u2019s not nothing. It should make Visa, American Express, and\xa0PayPal nervous. But it will not keep Janet Yellen up at night.

Assuming that last one doesn\u2019t apply to Overstock.com, its announcement that it will begin accepting Bitcoin by mid-2014 seems to be some mix of the first two reasons. The online retailer, whose 2012 revenue totaled $1.1 billion, is the largest yet to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Patrick Byrne, Overstock\u2019s chief executive, says the decision to accept Bitcoin is based half on his personal beliefs and half on the conviction that it\u2019s a sensible business decision. In essence, he\u2019s trying to lead mainstream merchants toward Bitcoin by adopting it himself. Byrne says he has wanted to accept Bitcoin payments for about two years and had been dreaming about creating his own gold-based currency for almost a decade before that. \u201cI\u2019m an Austrian economist by background, and we\u2019re the guys who like gold, but not for the reasons our Keynesian critics accuse us of,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you believe in limited government, you have to have something that no government mandarin can whisk into existence.\u201d That\u2019s the standard idealistic line for Bitcoin; the practical argument is that merchants can avoid paying credit card fees. This already works when the volume is modest, but the relatively small size of the overall Bitcoin system is a barrier to merchants of Overstock\u2019s scale. Currently 12.1 million Bitcoin are in circulation, with a total value of about $8.8 billion. At this size, the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate violently based on actions by a few big investors or the Chinese government. This is a problem: If a retailer saves 3 percent on credit card transactions, but the value of Bitcoin loses 5 percent before the retailer can convert it back into dollars, the concept will quickly lose its luster. Bitcoin-processing companies such as Bitpay and Coinbase take on this risk for merchants, offering to convert Bitcoin into U.S. dollars immediately. But they might not be able to handle that risk if any serious slice of Overstock\u2019s transactions comes in Bitcoin, says Barry Silbert, the founder and chief executive of SecondMarket and an investor in both companies. \u201cWhen you start talking to companies like Overstock or Amazon, they\u2019d only be able to guarantee those rates to a certain transaction amount,\u201d he says. Bitpay processed $100 million in transaction in 2013. \u201cI think the system is going to expand as quickly as it needs to,\u201d says Stephanie Wargo, the company\u2019s vice president of marketing. Of course, Overstock is unlikely to face a sudden deluge of orders in Bitcoin. Byrne expects orders to be a tiny amount of his overall business. But he is hoping his involvement will help solve Bitcoin\u2019s chicken-and-egg problem: The only way to decrease volatility is to increase the overall size of the system, and the only way to lure new people in is to have a currency useful enough to be stable. As for the risk that Overstock will take on, Byrne says the company could sell its Bitcoin every night, capping the amount at stake. But he would prefer to be able to buy derivatives that would allow him to hedge against Bitcoin crashes. Such derivatives don\u2019t really exist yet, but he thinks that will change. Silbert agrees. \u201c2014 is the year of Wall Street and Bitcoin,\u201d he says, although he does add that Wall Street\u2019s involvement in a market isn\u2019t likely to have a calming effect.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/joshuabrustein', 'name': u'Joshua Brustein', 'twitterhandle': u'joshuabrustein'}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-27/does-it-make-any-sense-for-overstock-dot-com-to-accept-bitcoin', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 2, 23, 26, 54, 55000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Does It Make Any Sense for Overstock.com to Accept Bitcoin?'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-11-03/firms-may-get-transitional-bitcoin-license-lawsky-says-video', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u'  Entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley to Wall Street say they don\u2019t care much for Bitcoin as a currency to supplant the U.S. dollar. As a payment technology they could use to undercut Visa Inc., Western Union Co. or Citigroup Inc., they say they like it a lot more. As Bitcoin\u2019s value gyrates, these investors have said that the headlines about its price and chatter about which retailers accept it obscure the real merit of what Satoshi Nakamoto, the name given to the anonymous person or people who created Bitcoin, delivered five years ago. \u201cAt some point, I had an \u2018aha!\u2019 moment and realized that Bitcoin was best understood as a new software protocol through which you could rebuild the payments industry in ways that are better and cheaper,\u201d Chris Dixon, a partner at Menlo Park, California-based venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote in a blog post. Bitcoin enthusiasts say they are building a system to move money across the Internet securely and at a lower cost than existing wire transfers, bank debits or remittances. If they can eliminate the friction created by middlemen and create easy-to-use consumer tools, Bitcoin businesses may claim a piece of the revenue and still deliver lower costs. Already, some retailers are paying 1 percent to process transactions in Bitcoin, improving profit margins. Taking debit or credit cards, they may pay more than 3 percent to issuing banks. Bitcoin transactions log immediately, and are confirmed in as little as five minutes. Skeptics counter that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility -- the price swings resemble those of a thinly traded currency -- could wipe out cost savings in what is still a small business. They also say the startups, in addition to facing entrenched incumbents, will layer their own costs onto Bitcoin transactions, undermining the goal of a cheaper system. A lower-cost virtual currency-driven payment system could take business from companies like Western Union that specialize in foreign remittances, as well as Visa and MasterCard Inc. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. reap billions in fees from the use of credit and debit cards, and are the main players in the direct-debit system. \u201cPerhaps the rise of Bitcoin will put pressure on big banks to get us a more modern payment system,\u201d said Jennifer Tescher, president of the Center for Financial Services Innovation, a Chicago-based research group. Bill Carcache, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst in New York, said any disruption is bound to move slowly. Visa and MasterCard have 35 million locations globally that accept their cards, and as many as 2 billion account holders. \u201cI\u2019d never dismiss the risk posed by a new technology, but I think the network effect that Visa and MasterCard have achieved creates a high hurdle for new competitors seeking to disintermediate them,\u201d said Carcache, who reiterated buy recommendations on Visa and MasterCard in a client note last month. Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a payments system is \u201can exotic topic within an exotic topic,\u201d said Arjan Schutte, founder of Los Angeles-based Core Innovation Capital, which invests in financial-services startups. It\u2019s also the driver behind the most important venture capital investments in virtual currencies, according to Schutte, far more important than the price of Bitcoins. \u201cI have no interest in owning Bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I am entirely interested in is frictionless money transfer.\u201d The global integration of financial markets obscures a central and costly problem: Moving the most basic asset, cash, can be expensive, slow and at times fraud-ridden. When a consumer swipes a debit card at a store, the amount is immediately subtracted from the customer\u2019s available cash. The merchant is paid only when the next collection of transactions clears, usually in a day, but sometimes at the cost of higher fraud levels, according to Shirley Inscoe of the Boston-based consultancy Aite Group LLC. When an immigrant gives cash to a Western Union agent, such as a convenience store, the money may be available quickly to a family member in another country only if the customer pays a premium. Businesses paying suppliers through the automated clearing system to which all U.S. banks belong have no guarantee that payments will clear the same day, and the process uses a 40-year-old software protocol. International wire transfers can take four or five days, and are costly enough to make small payments uneconomic, Inscoe said. Merchants pay about $48 billion in fees to banks for their customers\u2019 payment-card use and banks pay much of that to Visa and MasterCard, according to Aite Group. Unauthorized charges, sometimes linked to data breaches like the one at Target Corp., cost about $5 billion per year. Remittance providers such as Western Union Co. reap about $37 billion in fees each year from people sending money home, according to the World Bank. The Federal Reserve in September began a process for revamping payment systems. State banking supervisors also have formed their own group to examine how to reduce costs and increase speed, said Charles Vice, the commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions. \u201cWe\u2019ve not had a substantial look at clearing of payments in 40 years,\u201d Vice said. Paul Cohen, a Visa spokesman, and Seth Eisen at MasterCard declined to comment on Bitcoin\u2019s role as a payments technology. Andrew Silver, a Western Union spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement that the company is tracking the Bitcoin market while for now handling only regular currency. Like many banks, Wells Fargo & Co. is consulting \u201cinternal and external experts\u201d to learn more about virtual currencies, spokeswoman Richele Messick said. The chief innovation of Bitcoin involves a solution to what is known as the double-spending problem. Any payment that is not cash handed over in person, such as entries in a bank account, could be duplicated, allowing people to spend the same money twice. A trusted third party, such as a payment system run by Visa or MasterCard that confirms identities and ownership, adds costs while preventing double-spending. Nakamoto solved the problem by creating a public ledger that establishes ownership by anonymously recording who owns what Bitcoins. A volunteer network of computers validates every single transaction on the network by performing computations that prove they\u2019ve done the work, and receive new Bitcoins in return, eliminating the need for a third party. \u201cThat was the \u2018breaking the sound-barrier moment\u2019 for virtual currencies,\u201d said Tony Gallippi, who co-founded BitPay Inc., an Atlanta-based Bitcoin payment processor. Bitcoin transactions could mitigate the risks of breaches of the type reported by Target, Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. and other retailers, said Jerry Brito, director of the technology program at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. With Bitcoin, a customer doesn\u2019t leave behind the credentials necessary for additional, fraudulent transactions. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving the retailer anything but your Bitcoin address, the one from which you send the currency,\u201d Brito said. That address, revealed during the all-digital transaction, is useless without the private encryption key, which the customer does not reveal. By contrast, when using a payment card, a customer reveals an account number and pass code to a retailer. \u201cThink about that for a minute,\u201d Gallippi told a congressional committee. \u201cWhy would you ever give someone full access to your $20,000 line of credit to pay them $20?\u201d In the jargon of the industry, Bitcoin is a \u201cpayment rail,\u201d like Visa, Western Union or the bank-debiting system. Unlike those systems, Bitcoin is also the currency. Bitcoin is \u201ca bearer instrument,\u201d said Dixon, the partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in which Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is an investor. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know if I have the money -- it exists by virtue of the instrument,\u201d he said. The fact that it is a volatile currency is viewed by some as a downside in its use in transactions. A Bitcoin was worth about $875 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index yesterday, up from $609 a month earlier. Some merchants use San Francisco-based Coinbase to process payments and immediately convert the virtual currency into dollars. Jeff Klee, chief executive officer of Bitcoin-accepting airline ticketing site Cheapair.com, said the emerging exchanges help mitigate the exchange-rate risks. \u201cIf the price of Bitcoin dropped to zero tomorrow we would not feel the effects at all,\u201d Klee said. Mark Williams, a lecturer in finance at Boston University, said this model underscores how Bitcoin as a payment system cannot be divorced from Bitcoin as a currency. \u201cCompanies that are claiming they accept Bitcoin as payment are actually accepting the coin only if someone else accepts the price risk,\u201d Williams said. The Institute of International Finance, an association of major global banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup, said Bitcoin\u2019s volatility will limit its appeal. \u201cIt deters most large companies from accepting the digital currency as a form of payment,\u201d the group said in a recent report. The need for other companies like Coinbase to manage the Bitcoin-dollar nexus also undermines the goal of eliminating costly middlemen, said Aaron Greenspan, chief executive of Think Computer Corp., a software developer in Palo Alto, California. \u201cWe\u2019re going in circles here,\u201d Greenspan said. \u201cBitcoin is supposedly decentralized but we\u2019re creating these exchanges that centralize the trading, and at a cost.\u201d Peter Vessenes, the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, said the virtual currency, with software protocols open to any developer, won\u2019t allow any exchange to become dominant, and therefore expensive. \u201cBecause the Bitcoin network is open, it\u2019s fundamentally different than, say, a Visa network,\u201d Vessenes said. \u201cYou can\u2019t build a propriety network and keep other competitors out. There is no centralization of power.\u201d Coinbase charges its merchant clients 1 percent to cash their Bitcoin into dollars, and the first $1 million in transactions are free. Vinny Lingham, CEO of gift-card seller Gyft, said accepting Bitcoin still saves money even though it converts most of its Bitcoins back into dollars. He said that Gyft, which is based in San Francisco and sells cards for retailers including Amazon.com, Nike Inc. and Target, saves about 3 percent in swipe fees and fraud charges, and returns most of that to consumers in the form of redeemable points that can be redeemed for cards. \u201cIf you really adopt Bitcoin as a company, you need to pass back the benefits to the consumers,\u201d Lingham said. \u201cYou need to give people a reason to make payments\u201d in Bitcoin. Patrick Byrne, CEO of online retailer Overstock.com, estimates that 1 percent of its 2014 sales, or $13 million, will come from Bitcoin. Since its net margin is only 2 percent, the lower fees are a substantial savings. Jacob Farber, a lawyer with Perkins Coie in Washington, said the uses of Bitcoin as a payments system could extend to bank treasuries moving cash within companies, wiring money overseas or sending money to other banks. \u201cBitcoin could easily get picked up as back-office infrastructure for payments around the world,\u201d Farber said. That would jibe with how payments work today, since most consumers don\u2019t know how payment cards work, only that they do, said Mary Dent, who runs the Palo Alto, California-based consultancy dcIQ. The virtual currency\u2019s success may be measured by innovators\u2019 ability to create a new system while ditching the Bitcoin label. In the future, consumers may pay in dollars and merchants may receive the same, with Bitcoin having only an intermediary technological role. \u201cWho knows SMTP or HTTP?\u201d Dent said, referring to the coding systems for e-mail and the World Wide Web. \u201cBarely anybody. You just know that you can e-mail people and surf the Web. Someone is going to figure out how payments can be as easy and cheap as e-mail.\u201d That outcome would be very different than what a lot of libertarian-minded Bitcoin enthusiasts envisioned as its future: a decentralized currency free from the influence of governments or big banks, Williams said. \u201cIf Bitcoin becomes commercialized, to be successful it will have to look and operate a lot like the financial firms the movement derided when this e-currency protocol was created,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMany Bitcoiners will view this as a sell-out, as the capital raise needed to fund the commercialization of this venture would require large Wall Street backing.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-22/bitcoin-targets-giants-visa-to-jpmorgan-with-lower-cost-payments', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 22, 14, 31, 23, 317000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Targets Payments Business of Giants Visa to JPMorgan'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2015-12-03/blythe-masters-right-tech-better-than-barclays-investment-bank', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2015-12-11/goldman-and-other-banks-stake-claims-on-bitcoin-frontier', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' I\u2019ve been paying my bills with iPhones. Not with apps or on bank sites\u2014I\u2019ve been using the Apple hardware as currency.  It started by accident in December, during a business trip to New York. I live in Rome, where domestic work comes cheap and technology is expensive. An unlocked, gold, 32-gigabyte iPhone 5s that costs about $815 with tax in the U.S. goes for \u20ac839 (about $1,130) in Italy, roughly a month\u2019s wages for workers who do laundry, pick up kids from school, or provide care for the elderly. When one worker heard I was visiting the States, she asked me to pick her up an iPhone in lieu of the equivalent cash for work she\u2019d done. Lining up inside the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue, I was surrounded by shoppers speaking languages from around the world. The salesman looked stunned when I said I wanted an unlocked iPhone. Just one?  A new shipment of unlocked 5s phones had just come in, he said, adding that the gold model I asked for was the most popular in Europe and the easiest to resell. To my right, a man with a credit card from a Saudi bank was trying to buy his third and fourth phones of the day. \u201cMake it two,\u201d I said. There was one more step: The salesman grabbed a landline from behind the counter to connect me with my bank\u2019s antifraud department. Purchases from this store, he said, are red flags. Do the math, and that\u2019s no surprise. Exiting the store with my plastic Apple shopping bag secured by a rope drawstring, I no longer thought of the phones inside as appliances. They were more like gold bars.   Transnational workers rich and poor have long dealt in an ever-evolving system of arbitrage for luxury goods carrying significant price differences around the world. A few years ago, it was Louis Vuitton and Gucci handbags, bought in Paris by Asians who paid for trips home by selling the purses at a markup. In the early 1990s, Levi\u2019s jeans served a similar function for Americans in Eastern Europe. Today, it\u2019s the iPhone, especially that gold 5s.  Kyle Wiens, chief executive officer of the iPhone spare-parts distributor IFixit, was scuba diving during a break from a November conference in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, when the dive leader offered free boat trips if Wiens ever returned to Mexico with iPhones to sell at the U.S. price. (The phone costs about 16 percent more in Mexico than in the U.S.) Wiens says he\u2019s seeing more and more widespread iPhone arbitrage. When he goes to China to meet suppliers, he brings a couple iPhones and iPads to sell at cost, as a gesture of goodwill. Alexander Peterc, an analyst with Exane BNP Paribas whose office sits above the Apple Store on London\u2019s Regent Street, says that for more than a month after the 5s came out last year, people from countries where it wasn\u2019t yet available lined up every day. \u201cThey can probably pay their plane ticket by buying two phones and selling them in India,\u201d says Peterc. Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted that the cross-border movement of iPhones is important to his bottom line. In July, when Apple reported revenue in Greater China had dropped 14 percent in the previous quarter, to $4.6 billion, he blamed a downturn in purchases in Hong Kong, where tourists and resellers are major customers. Apple spokeswoman Teresa Brewer declined to comment.   Average price in the U.S. of a gold iPhone 5S with 16GB of memory, according to Mobile Unlocked  According to a list of iPhone prices in 48 countries compiled by Stanmere (U.K.)-based Mobile Unlocked, the cheapest 5s with 16GB of memory can be purchased for about $700 in the U.S. The most expensive country in which to purchase the same phone is Brazil, at $1,200. At a little less than $1,000, Italy ranked seventh-most expensive, tied with Malta. Within a couple days of my return, I exchanged both phones for domestic work, valuing them at the $815 I\u2019d paid. The second phone\u2019s recipient sold hers for its local value ($1,130) to an acquaintance, she said, with payments to be made over time. She told me the new owner sold the phone at an additional markup on an installment plan that will cost the final buyer about $1,350. On a trip to Los Angeles a few weeks after my Fifth Avenue purchases, I found myself in front of another Apple Store. Walking in felt like a visit to an ATM. I asked the salesperson for an unlocked iPhone 5s. The response: Just one? I didn\u2019t have a buyer lined up, so I did buy only one. Still, when I got back to Italy, I exchanged it within a week, for \u20ac600 worth of household work from someone whose phone had been stolen on the subway. She\u2019d bought the stolen one on layaway for \u20ac1,000, and is still paying it off. I was relieved to make the deal: An iPhone\u2019s value lasts only until the next product launch.

The rial fell from 20,160 against the greenback on the street market in August to 36,500 rials to the dollar in October. It\u2019s settled, for now, around 27,000. The central bank\u2019s fixed official rate is 12,260. Yet there\u2019s one currency in Iran that has kept its value and can be used to purchase goods from abroad: bitcoins, the online-only currency.    Created in 2009 by a mysterious programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoins behave a lot like any currency. Their value is determined by demand, and they can be used to buy stuff. Bitcoin transactions are encrypted and handled by a decentralized global network of tens of thousands of personal computers. Merchants around the world accept the currency, from a bakery in San Francisco to a dentist in Finland. Individuals who own bitcoins and wish to exchange them for physical currencies like euros or dollars can use exchange sites such as localbitcoins.com, a Finland-based site founded by Jeremias Kangas. \u201cI believe that bitcoin is, or will be in the future, a very effective tool for individuals who want to avoid sanctions, currency restrictions, and high inflation in countries such as Iran,\u201d Kangas wrote in an e-mail.  The advantage for Iranians is that bitcoins can be swapped for dollars that can then be kept outside the country. Another plus: Regulators can\u2019t easily track the transactions, since bitcoins aren\u2019t issued from a central server. Bitcoin users can conduct business on virtual private networks, which hide customers\u2019 identities. At online store coinDL.com, shoppers can use bitcoins to buy Beyond Matter, the latest album from Iranian artist Mohammad Rafigh. Anyone in the U.S. downloading songs, which fetch .039 bitcoins or 45\xa2 each, risks violating U.S. sanctions. That doesn\u2019t bother Rafigh, who\u2019s studying computer engineering as well as playing music. \u201cBitcoin is so interesting for me,\u201d Rafigh wrote in an e-mail. \u201cI wish the culture of using digital money spreads all over the world, because it does not have any dependency on anything like politics.\u201d Rafigh has translated some bitcoin software into Farsi for his friends. \u201cI love Iran, and if bitcoin is good for me, it can be good for more Iranians like me.\u201d    Iranian-American bitcoin consultant Farzad Hashemi recently traveled to Tehran and talked up bitcoin to his friends. \u201cThey are instantly fascinated by it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a flash for them when they realize how it can solve their problems.\u201d Iranians working or living abroad can send bitcoins to their families, who can use one of the online currency matchmaking services to find someone willing to exchange bitcoins for euros, rials, or dollars. Bitcoins are useful to Iranians wishing to move their money abroad, either to children studying in Europe or America or simply to stash cash in a safe place.  As the value of the rial plunges, many Iranians are trying to acquire foreign currencies. \u201cWe have no idea what will happen,\u201d says Amir-Hossein Madani, who says he\u2019s traded tens of millions of street market dollars in Tehran over the past two years. \u201cThese days prices change every 10 minutes.\u201d  The uncertainty has led some Iranian software developers to ask clients to pay them in bitcoins. \u201cAnyone with a computer is able to own, send, and receive them. You can be at an Internet cafe in Iran and managing a bitcoin account,\u201d says Jon Matonis, a founding board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, a Seattle nonprofit that promotes the currency. The exchange rate in Iran is 332,910 rials per bitcoin. It isn\u2019t known how many Iranians use bitcoins to skirt sanctions. According to localbitcoins\u2019 Kangas, 32\xa0people in Iran have contacted each other through his site.  An internal FBI report in April expressed concern over the online currency. The report was leaked to Wired and Betabeat. \u201cSince Bitcoin does not have a centralized authority, law enforcement faces difficulties detecting suspicious activity, identifying users, and obtaining transaction records\u2014problems that might attract malicious actors to Bitcoin,\u201d says the report.

Examples include:  \u2022 MPX Energia, EBX\u2019s energy company, has five power plants in operation, totaling 1,251 megawatts of installed capacity, which will reach 2,838 Mw by the end of 2013. \u2022 With investments of 3.5 billion reais ($1.8 billion) already made, construction of the A\xe7u Superport is proceeding apace with operational startup scheduled for 2013. \u2022 Major oil and gas companies have signed contracts to install facilities in the A\xe7u Industrial Complex. These include General Electric and, more recently, W\xe4rtsil\xe4, Asco Power Technologies, and BP (in a joint venture with EBX). In addition, when the article mentions the \u201cgenerosity\u201d of the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), the magazine fails to inform its readers that those funds, which the EBX Group is using legitimately and which were acquired and are being paid back under the same terms offered to the rest of the market, were approved after undergoing careful scrutiny. BNDES\u2019s exposure to the EBX Group is extremely comfortable, as most disbursement operations for the EBX companies are secured through fund transfers and letters of credit from other banks. Finally, it should remain clear that the projects of the EBX Group were given their starts with capital provided directly by Eike Batista and funds raised from investors and through financing secured in the market. \xa0Maria Fernanda de FreitasMedia relations managerEBX HoldingRio de Janeiro\xa0The Real Driver of Gas Prices\u201cWhy Abundant Oil Hasn\u2019t Cut Gasoline Prices\u201d (Global Economics, April 1-April 7) falsely claims that the Jones Act has made it more costly to move fuel between U.S. ports, driving up prices at the pump. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has said its \u201canalysis of the petroleum market points to the price of crude as the main contributor to the large changes in gasoline prices the U.S. has experienced in recent years.\u201d In fact, crude, combined with federal, state, and local taxes, accounts for approximately 80 percent of the ultimate price of gas for consumers. As was also noted in the article, global demand for petroleum products drives the price of gasoline. Year-over-year global product demand is up. Moreover, the most recent price spike was due to such factors as rises in crude and planned and unplanned refinery outages that affected output. As the EIA also noted in February, about two-thirds of the rise in gas prices since the start of 2013 resulted from higher margins at refineries from gasoline production. The petroleum market is an extraordinarily complex global market, with consumer prices affected by many variables. To suggest that the Jones Act contributes to the higher costs of gasoline to U.S. consumers overly simplifies this complex system. The good news is that the price of gasoline decreased during the month of March for the first time in a decade. And that occurred with the Jones Act as the law of the land, further proof that the Jones Act has no impact on the price at the pump.\xa0Board of directorsAmerican Maritime PartnershipWashington\xa0What Bitcoin Can DoRegarding \u201cThe Bitcoin of the Realm\u201d (Opening Remarks, April 1-April 7), I think people are missing the real value of Bitcoin.  On the surface, Bitcoin is a bit like rhinoceros horn. Its value derives from its reliable scarcity and an illogical human willingness to invest that fact with some importance. This is absurd. After all, rhinoceros toes are just as rare and just as useless as rhinoceros horns, but we don\u2019t value them. The real value of Bitcoin is that it is a reliable and secure bookkeeping system that reduces transaction costs to near zero. If a government were to render its currency in something like Bitcoin, if they were to back up the intrinsically worthless entity with the usual promises, they would suddenly find themselves the masters of a magnificently efficient banking and clearing operation.

But one soon could be tracking social media itself, according to a recent article in ETF.com. A company called Market Prophit\xa0is currently in discussions with a variety of ETF issuers to make an ETF out of its new index called the Market Prophit Social Media Sentiment Index. This is a long/short smart beta-style index that aims to capture surgically the so-called sentiment factor on Twitter. The index holds the 25 most-tweeted-about stocks and is reconstituted quarterly but rebalances daily. The stocks\u2019 daily tweets are analyzed by an algorithm to determine whether the sentiment is positive or negative. The index will then be long or short, based on sentiment from the Twitterverse on a daily basis. The stocks get a sentiment score that\xa0also determines the weight in the index in addition to market cap. In theory, it could be 100\xa0percent\xa0long or a 100\xa0percent\xa0short. Currently it holds such giants as Apple, Amazon.com, and Microsoft. But it also holds some smaller companies, still popular on financial Twitter, such as GoPro, Tesla, and Baidu. And yes, it also holds Twitter. The index is up 7 percent this year, as seen in the chart below. Not bad considering the S&P 500 Index is down 1.5 percent. \xa0 \xa0 The outperformance this year is mostly from shorting stocks. It had 36 percent of its stocks shorted prior to Aug.\xa024\xa0because, well, that\u2019s what sentiment on Twitter told it to do. Overall, it has been a good year for any index or ETF that had some kind of short exposure in its strategy. While this concept may seem far out, it is really just an evolution of ETFs such as the Global X Guru Index ETF (GURU)\u2014which tracks hedge funds\u2019 top holdings using 13F filings\u2014and the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW), which tracks the stocks that display the most positive sentiment from insider buying and favorable analyst ratings. What would make an ETF like Market Prohit\u2019s different, however, is the crowdsourcing element. It is one thing to track legal filings but another to track anyone who is\xa0tweeting. Another difference is that legal filings are a bit more backward-looking, since\xa0they come out quarterly with a lag. Market Prohit's index is adjusting on a daily basis. On the downside, this daily adjusting could mean the ETF racks up capital gains taxes from the increased buying and selling. Moreover, it would incur\xa0additional costs from borrowing stocks to short. Among\xa0ETFs in registration that seem to capture attention and imagination, this one ranks with ETFs looking to track Bitcoin, diamonds, the spread between China A and H shares, and short-squeezed stocks.

The leading store for illicit e-commerce, it seems, was an elaborate\xa0scam. In online forums,\xa0users of the site mourned their lost money, called for blood, and\xa0desperately hoped their last order of pills would show up in their mailboxes. As recently as two years ago,\xa0online black markets worked well enough that many thought buying drugs there was on its way to being\xa0as safe and easy as dealing in braided necklaces on Etsy. That utopia\xa0began to crumble with the seizure of\xa0online\xa0black market Silk Road in 2013 and\xa0the\xa0arrest\xa0and conviction of Ross Ulbricht as the mastermind behind the site.\xa0It\u2019s been tumultuous days ever since. Law enforcement busted dozens of Dark Web marketplaces in November, and German police last week\xa0seized a third of a ton of drugs from a single online dealer. But if police are threatening the Dark Web, so are the people who use it.\xa0Evolution isn\u2019t the first marketplace to be caught up in what\u2019s known as an exit\xa0scam, where operators shut down a website\xa0and take their users\u2019 money with them. Since these\xa0sites owe their existence to clever technology allowing private and secure transactions, the question naturally arises:\xa0Can more of this kind of tech save the\xa0underworld from its own worst tendencies? The answer is a resounding maybe. Dark Web marketplaces require the use of several types of specialized technology: Tor\xa0allows\xa0people to browse the Web while hiding their identities, and Bitcoin lets\xa0them transact their business more discreetly than they could\xa0through the traditional financial system.\xa0Even with these tools, there\u2019s a dilemma: How does an\xa0anonymous drug user\xa0trust an anonymous drug seller to\xa0deliver the desired product? The solution has been marketplaces that\xa0operate as neutral brokers. Buyers and sellers rate one another, much as they do on EBay or Amazon.com. When someone makes a purchase, her money is placed in an escrow account controlled by the marketplace and is released only when\xa0the drugs have arrived. The product\xa0offered by sites like Silk Road and Evolution, in other words, is the ability to trust otherwise\xa0untrustworthy people. \u201cThey\u2019re not monetizing the sale of drugs. They are monetizing the ability\xa0to\xa0reverse a transaction,\u201d\xa0says\xa0Nicolas Christin, an assistant research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies\xa0the Dark Web. \u201cThey\u2019re monetizing the escrow systems.\u201d What reason is there to trust the marketplaces? For the most part,\xa0credibility\xa0is built the old-fashioned way\u2014by not running off with the Bitcoins. Silk Road operated without any real way to guarantee\xa0against its operators\u2019 ripping off its users. Subsequent marketplaces have largely done the same. Some\xa0people\xa0involved in the Dark Web have been\xa0pushing\xa0for a more technological safeguard, known alternately as\xa0multiparty signature and multi-signature escrow. This is a technology built into Bitcoin that\xa0keeps\xa0transactions from being completed until two of three parties involved sign off on the deal. Think of it as\xa0a bank deposit box that requires authorization from the account holder\xa0and a bank officer to access. Evolution claimed to support\xa0multi-signature\xa0escrow, although there are conflicting accounts of whether the feature ever actually worked.\xa0The same is true of Agora, the black market site most likely to\xa0gain from Evolution\u2019s disappearance.\xa0What is clear is that few people actually use this protection when\xa0buying\xa0drugs\xa0online. In part,\xa0this\xa0is because it\u2019s\xa0just\xa0easier not to take the extra step. You know, they\u2019re busy. Even if a Dark Web marketplace\xa0isn\u2019t planning to abscond with its users\u2019\xa0money, it has an incentive not to support the technology. All Bitcoin transactions are tracked in a record known as the\xa0blockchain, and\xa0multi-signature\xa0transactions are identifiable as such. Because almost no one bothers to use this feature now,\xa0a marketplace that suddenly started\xa0implementing\xa0it would risk outing itself to law enforcement. \u201cThere are a FEW legitimate transactions that are multiparty signatures, but for the most part it only happens amongst three or more mutually distrusting parties: the multiparty transactions are the drug deals, and if the feds ever find out either a buyer or a seller, the blockchain now DIRECTLY records the other side,\u201d writes Nicholas Weaver, a security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley. Insecurity doesn\u2019t seem to be damping demand. Just before Silk\xa0Road was shut down, there were about 13,000 listings for drugs on the site, and 18,000 such listings on the Dark Web overall, according to the Digital Citizens Alliance.\xa0On the day Evolution vanished, there were 19,900 drug listings on that site alone,\xa0and 41,900 in all. Distrust in marketplaces has caused a number of large dealers to take their customers off the markets and\xa0continue selling them drugs directly through their own secret sites,\xa0earning loyalty\xa0through their continued good names, says\xa0Tim Bingham, an independent researcher studying the drug trade.\xa0He says\xa0three or four major dealers have done this since the Silk Road shutdown, although he adds that\xa0they probably also\xa0continue to do business on marketplaces like Agora. There\xa0will inevitably be more scams, says\xa0Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Christin, because the temptation is just too strong for criminals who build successful online drug bazaars.\xa0\u201cIf you run a marketplace long enough,\xa0either you\u2019re going to be in jail or you\u2019re going to steal the money that\u2019s in escrow,\u201d he says.

If you\'re struggling to think of an answer, welcome to the world of "Bitcoin mining." As a lot of folks know now, thanks to all-hands-on-deck media saturation, Bitcoin is a medium of transaction created in 2009 by an anonymous programmer to facilitate anonymous digital transactions (there\u2019s an excellent history here\n). In the recent speculative mania, the value of Bitcoins skyrocketed. Before Bitcoins can be traded, though, they need to be created. That\'s where "mining" comes in. Mining is a process in which powerful computers create Bitcoins by solving processor-intensive equations. The idea is to keep the supply of Bitcoins from multiplying too quickly. Bitcoin mining, like mining of precious metals, is supposed to be arduous. By design, the more miners there are, the more processing power is required to mint new coins. Most people aren\u2019t used to thinking in terms of the energy it takes to solve math problems; a few minutes of Excel may not take much energy. But make the problems complicated enough, and things change. \u201cMining\u201d Bitcoins takes so much processor power that it\u2019s often done with specialized computers\n optimized for rapid repetitive calculations. So how much power can that take?  Blockchain.info, a site that tracks data on Bitcoin mining, estimates that in just the last 24 hours, miners used about $147,000 of electricity\n just to run their hardware, assuming an average price of 15 cents per kilowatt hour (a little higher than the U.S. average, lower than some high cost areas like California\n). That, of course, is in addition to the money devoted to buying and building the mining rigs. The site estimates the profits from the day of mining at about $681,000, based on the current value of Bitcoins. So mining, at least for the moment\n, is a lucrative business.  More from Mark Gimein: The trade-off here is that as virtual value is created, real-world value is used up. About 982 megawatt hours a day, to be exact. That\u2019s enough to power roughly 31,000 U.S. homes\n, or about half a Large Hadron Collider\n. If the dreams of Bitcoin proponents are realized, and the currency is adopted for widespread commerce, the power demands of bitcoin mines would rise dramatically.  If that makes you think of the vast efforts devoted to the mining of precious metals in the centuries of gold- and silver-based economies, it should. One of the strangest aspects of the Bitcoin frenzy is that the Bitcoin economy replicates some of the most archaic features of the gold standard. Real-world mining of precious metals for currency was a resource-hungry and value-destroying process. Bitcoin mining is too.

Gold and silver coins starring Russian czars, Chinese leaders and Roman emperors are igniting bidding wars as numismatic buffs compete with investors and wealthy collectors from emerging economies for the tiny relics. Heritage Auctions set a record this week for a Brazilian coin sold at auction when a gold 1822 piece depicting the country\u2019s first Emperor, Pedro I, fetched $499,375 in New York, said Cristiano Bierrenbach, the Dallas-based company\u2019s head of world coins. Six of the 10 bidders were from Brazil. A 1711 Mexican Felipe V gold royal cob 8 escudos brought $293,750. The sales were part of the 42nd annual New York International Numismatic Convention, the largest international gathering of dealers and auctioneers in the field of ancient and world coins. The event, running through Jan. 13 at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, showcases an increasingly global market for the collectibles. In addition to a series of auctions, it includes 120 dealers hawking coins dating back to ancient Greece. \u201cCollecting coins used to be more of a hobby,\u201d said Kevin Foley, the convention\u2019s bourse chairman. \u201cNow it\u2019s an investment area, with people paying millions for coins.\u201d The most expensive coin at auction, a 1794 Flowing Hair silver U.S. dollar, fetched $10 million at Stack\u2019s Bowers Galleries last January in New York. In 2012, an anonymous collector paid $4.4 million for a 1740 Russian coin at Zurich-based Sincona AG, the auction house said. \u201cThere is an increasing pool of bidders and buyers from China, Russia, Eastern Europe, India and Latin America,\u201d Bierrenbach said. \u201cIt\u2019s people who are coming up in the upper middle class and have more disposable income.\u201d Heritage Auctions sold $37 million of world and ancient coins in 2013, a 131 percent increase from 2008. Its sales of U.S. coins fell 7 percent during the same period. Historic significance is one appeal of rare coins; size is another. Unlike such larger collectibles as fine art, antiques, wine and automobiles, coins are easy to store and transport. \u201cYou can have tens of millions in rare coins and keep them in your safe deposit box,\u201d said Brian Kendrella, president of Irvine, California-based Stack\u2019s Bowers. Numismatic Guaranty Corp., headquartered in Sarasota, Florida, will authenticate, grade and encase any coin for a fee of $14 to $600, according to Max Spiegel, the company\u2019s vice president of sales and marketing. If it turns out to be a fake, the company will buy the coin for the current market value. Bierrenbach said Heritage Auctions sold $14.6 million of ancient and world coins earlier this week and expects more than $5 million in transactions at the Jan. 14 sale of 1,900 world coins from the trove of Eric P. Newman, a 102-year-old collector from St. Louis. Russian and ancient coins brought $6.5 million during a two-day sale that ended at 1 a.m. today at the convention, said Dmitry Markov of New York-based Dmitry Markov Coins & Medals, which organized the sale with London-based Baldwin\u2019s Auctions Ltd. and M&M Numismatics Ltd. in Washington. The top lot was an 1876 gold 25 rubles coin commemorating the 30th birthday of Russian czar Alexander II\u2019s son Vladimir, Markov said. It fetched $325,000, surpassing the presale estimate of $200,000. More than a half of all lots went to Russian buyers, Markov said. Roman coins are popular with international collectors, including those from Russia and China. Classical Numismatic Group Inc., which has offices in London and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said it sold $6.35 million of classical and ancient coins in a four-part sale that exceeded its presale target by 63 percent. The top lot was a gold coin from the reign of Roman Emperor Probus (276-282 A.D.) that fetched $190,000 against the presale estimate of $75,000. Four live auctions by Stack\u2019s Bowers Galleries begin today at the Waldorf Astoria. One highlight is a machine made, 1755 Colombian coin estimated at $100,000 to $150,000. \u201cIn the past five years there\u2019s been a wider acceptance of rare coins as a collectible,\u201d Kendrella said. \u201cAnybody who is our customer looks at investing as a component of their purchase.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-10/rare-coins-lure-emerging-market-buyers-to-n-y-convention', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 11, 2, 30, 52, 841000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Rare Coins Lure Emerging Market Buyers to N.Y.

Eager to profit from growing demand for the digital currency, Sun has invested more than $3,000 in a company called 796 Xchange Ltd., an online exchange for trading stocks and other financial instruments related to Bitcoin, where initial public offerings are also being held. He\u2019s part of a small but growing group of investors in China who have put the country into contention with the U.S. as the biggest downloader of the virtual money that\u2019s being used to buy a growing range of goods and services online. While intensified scrutiny by U.S. regulators casts doubt on the currency\u2019s future there, China\u2019s Bitcoin industry is expanding. \u201cWhat\u2019s worrisome is that a lot of people could be just treating it as a speculative investment,\u201d said Peter Pak, head of trading of BOCI Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. \u201cIn China, the stock market, property and bond market are all not so good, so people get really excited when they hear of a new investment that generates high returns.\u201d Sun\u2019s outlay of about 28 Bitcoins -- or $3,108 -- for more than 400 shares in 796 Xchange has returned about 46 percent since the stock\u2019s Aug. 1 debut on the company\u2019s own website. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has only gained about 2 percent during the same period. Bitcoin is similar to other currencies -- say, the Mexican peso -- except it\u2019s not controlled by any government and the total number is capped at about 21 million coins. Computer users can \u201cmine\u201d them by solving mathematical puzzles -- uncovering the hidden series of letters and numbers that matches up with security keys specified by the computer programmers who invented Bitcoin in 2009. As more are mined, the puzzles get harder, and therefore more expensive to crack. Sun turned to shares of Bitcoin companies after initially trying to mine the currency crunching algorithms on souped-up PCs at his office and home. He gave up after a month, concluding that his computers weren\u2019t up to the task. \u201cSimple desktops can no longer dig them up,\u201d he said. There are about 11.5 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Blockchain.info, which tracks the virtual currency. At today\u2019s price of about $121, there\u2019s still $1.15 billion to unearth. The inherent scarcity of Bitcoin that was intended to help secure its value has also attracted early investors -- Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins known for their claim to have co-founded Facebook Inc., own about 1 percent of the currency in issue. Prices have been volatile, with the value of one Bitcoin varying from $84 to $266 in the span of one week in April, according to Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the largest exchange that allows Bitcoin to be traded for dollars, euros and other currencies. More advanced miners use specially designed gadgets that cost as much as 86 Bitcoins, about $10,407, in order to mine the digital currency. Labcoin, managed by Hong Kong-based ITec-Pro Ltd., also began trading its shares this month in a virtual market. The seller of virtual-mining equipment had a market value of 20,000 Bitcoins, or about $2.4 million. Another company that sold shares is Myminer, which operates \u201cmining farms\u201d in China, where it says the low cost of power to run computers gives it an edge. BTC Garden, a Shenzhen-based Bitcoin miner, withdrew its IPO this month, citing a dispute with an investor. Hong Kong-incorporated 796 Xchange offers an online stock market for Bitcoin companies, as well as futures, financing and IPO services, all priced in Bitcoins, according to its website. BTCChina.com, China\u2019s most popular Bitcoin exchange, lets traders to use the payment systems of more established companies. That includes Tencent Holdings Ltd., the nation\u2019s biggest Internet company, and Alipay, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the No. 1 e-commerce company. Other Bitcoin trading platforms popular in China include FXBTC.com and Btctrade.com. China briefly overtook the U.S. in monthly downloads of Bitcoins in May, and now ranks second, according to SourceForge. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission sued a Texas man over claims he operated a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme. New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services this month sent subpoenas to 22 digital-currency companies to determine whether new regulations should be adopted, according to a person familiar with the matter. The lack of regulation, which has drawn scrutiny from U.S. regulators, is why Bitcoins are taking off in China, where the government controls the flow of money overseas and keeps a tight rein on what it views as undesirable behavior. \u201cThe advantage for Chinese users to use Bitcoin is freedom, people can do something without any official authority,\u201d said Patrick Lin, system administrator of Erights.net and owner of about 1,500 Bitcoins. Lin said he\u2019s sticking to the currency itself, rather than IPOs, in part because of weak regulation. \u201cThe Bitcoin world is just like the Wild West -- no law, but opportunity and risk,\u201d he said. The China Securities Regulatory Commission didn\u2019t respond to a faxed query on whether it\u2019s looking at new rules regarding Bitcoin. So long as it remains small, the industry may continue to fly below the radar screen of a Chinese government more preoccupied with a faltering economy and social stability. \u201cIf the circulation of Bitcoins is still confined to a small circle of people, it won\u2019t be something on the Chinese authority\u2019s priority list,\u201d said Edward Au, co-head of Deloitte China\u2019s public-offering group. \u201cThey already have too much to cope with.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-20/bitcoin-spawns-china-virtual-ipos-as-u-s-scrutiny-grows', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 8, 21, 10, 33, 23, 190000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Spawns China Virtual IPOs as U.S. Scrutiny Grows'}, {'articleText': u'  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued a Texas man over claims he operated a Ponzi scheme involving Bitcoin, the virtual currency that has recently attracted investors including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

The website, started in 1998, has been a rare dot-com success for the long-suffering, ink-fueled newspaper industry. It\u2019s an impressive platform built around a massive inventory of new and used car listings alongside financial calculators, dealership reviews, and buying guides. Looking for a Ford F150 within 10 miles of midtown Manhattan? Cars.com finds 21 new trucks ranging from $35,290 to a $59,780 \u201cRaptor\u201d model, as well as 25 used models. But Cars.com didn\u2019t become a $3 billion business, to cite the figure mentioned in the Bloomberg News report on the terms being sought, solely by helping car shoppers. Catering to car dealers has been just as critical to its success, if not more. The range of options the site sells car broker is lengthy, from standard upgrades\u2014preferred placement on search results, old-school online banner ads\u2014to the additional consultant-like offerings. Cars.com can teach dealers how to text potential customers, navigate social media, analyze online search patterns, and respond to negative reviews. It even crawls search-engine data and sells leads to potential buyers. For a consumer-serving business to draw so much revenue from nonconsumers is not without risk. \u201cThey have certain business requirements that they have to meet, which may or may not have the best impact on the consumer,\u201d said Arianne Walker, senior director of auto media marketing at J.D.

Floor mats are never free, right? But car dealerships are catching up \u2026 at least to 2005 or so. Their websites are getting better and more responsive. And a rash of entrepreneurs are developing ways to schedule remote test drives, sell new cars via online auctions, and communicate with buyers via dedicated apps. A few brave dealerships are even accepting Bitcoin. Some third-party sites are going a step further than Cars.com. TrueCar, for example, has a network of 8,000 \u201ccertified dealerships\u201d that offer guaranteed prices for specific models on its platform. It gets $300 for every reference that ends in a sale.

Legal agreements like the one Tera Group created can spur derivatives trading by offering investors a template for structuring deals. The overall swaps market was spurred in the 1980s by another framework: the International Swaps & Derivatives Association\u2019s master legal document, which is still in use today for customized trades that can\u2019t be backed by clearinghouses. Swaps let investors, companies and institutions exchange one kind of payment for another. Some use swaps to exchange principal and interest in one currency for the same in another currency. They can also be used to speculate on prices or to replicate the return on specific investments. The regulation of Bitcoin and related derivatives is an unresolved question in many parts of the world. Even as regulators and investors struggle to grasp Bitcoin\u2019s many uses - - including investment vehicle, payment-processing system and money-laundering tool -- they are now confronted with the additional complexities of an emerging derivatives market.

George Samman, a former Wall Street investment adviser who in May helped start a platform for betting on Bitcoin\u2019s price swings, saw trading on his BTC.sx website grow to more than $35 million by Jan. 21.

Gox has publicly verified its legitimacy. Calls and e-mails to the company in Tokyo went unanswered. Mt. Gox went offline to \u201cprotect the site and our users,\u201d according to a statement on its website. \u201cWe will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly,\u201d it added. Bitcoin prices rose 11 percent to $592.58 at 8:52 a.m. London time after slumping to as low as $418.78 yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Prices have retreated from as high as $1,151 on Dec. 4. The news on Mt. Gox triggered renewed calls for better security and consumer protection from several U.S. federal and state officials. Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who held the first hearings in the U.S. Congress on Capitol Hill, said the potential losses at Mt. Gox underscored the need for clear rules sooner rather than later. \u201cAs any industry matures it will face growing pains and there will be individuals who believe they can use the fog of uncertainty to cover up their follies,\u201d Carper said. Mt. Gox received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in New York this month asking it to preserve certain documents, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. Jennifer Queliz, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, neither confirmed nor denied the existence of a federal investigation when contacted by Bloomberg. Bharara\u2019s office previously has filed charges against Bitcoin operators of the Silk Road and BitInstant exchanges. Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles resigned this week from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, the group that promotes and sets technical standards for the digital money. The turmoil at the exchange highlighted how most Bitcoin-related companies are still operating in a regulatory gray zone. \u201cTailored regulation could play an important role in protecting consumers and the security of the money that they entrust to virtual currency firms,\u201d Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of financial services in New York, said in a statement. Japanese authorities are investigating the closing of the Mt. Gox exchange, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said today. The Financial Services Agency, Finance Ministry and police are gathering information on the matter and will take steps as needed after assessing the situation, he said at a news briefing in Tokyo. Mark Williams, a former regulator and commodities trader who now teaches at Boston University, said that \u201cmuch trust has been lost\u201d with law enforcement, regulators and now consumers. \u201cTo win back customer trust and gain broader adoption, Bitcoin community will need to accept regulation, work through well-established banking channels and embrace strong consumer protection rules,\u201d Williams said in an e-mail. At least one investor placed a vote of confidence in Bitcoin. Barry Silbert, chief executive of SecondMarket Inc., a New York brokerage, announced yesterday that his company would found a new Bitcoin exchange. SecondMarket, which already runs a Bitcoin investment vehicle for accredited investors, will spin off that business into the new one, and invest $20 million in cash and Bitcoin to seed the exchange. Silbert said he is in discussions with \u201chalf dozen banks of global stature\u201d about being members of the exchange, which would also include brokerages and money-services businesses. The troubles at Mt. Gox over the past few weeks haven\u2019t derailed the plans, which Silbert said hopes to finalize by the end of March. \u201cWe would not be moving forward with building appropriately structured, regulated exchange if we thought this would damage Bitcoin long term,\u201d Silbert said in an interview. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital currency, based on a peer-to-peer software protocol, has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify transactions while preserving users\u2019 anonymity. The Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which works to combat money laundering, said in March that digital currency businesses could be considered money transmitters, which are licensed by U.S. states. Stephen Hudak, a spokesman for FinCEN, said the agency was monitoring the situation at Mt. Gox. Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, a San Francisco-based payments processor, said that until California establishes rules for digital currency businesses, companies have to work to win customer trust on their own. \u201cThe only thing we can do is show we have a great track record and a credible management team,\u201d Ehrsam said. The main financial backer of Coinbase is venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, in which Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is an investor. Ehrsam said that the Bitcoin industry is \u201cnot completely out of first generation Bitcoin infrastructure.\u201d Coinbase brought in Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer at Blockchain.info, a London-based company that maintains online \u201cwallets\u201d used to store digital currencies, to audit its security. Ehrsam called it a \u201cpeer review\u201d that the company sought of its own accord, and Antonopoulos wrote on his own blog that Coinbase is \u201coperating according to security best practices.\u201d Fred Wilson, managing partner at New York\u2019s Union Square Ventures, which has backed Bitcoin companies, said he \u201cbought a little Bitcoin today\u201d after the price plunged, and recalled a Wall Street aphorism. \u201cI always feel good buying when there is blood in the streets in any market,\u201d Wilson wrote on his blog. \u201cIt is my favorite time to buy.\u201d Jerry Brito, director of the technology program at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, said the public-relations challenge for Bitcoin firms could ebb if \u201cthe professionals\u201d at other companies take the lead in restoring stability to the Bitcoin market. \u201cThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s bad for Bitcoin\u2019s reputation,\u201d Brito said. \u201cIn the long run it\u2019s good, because it\u2019s the closing chapter of the amateur hobbyist Bitcoiners who laid out the initial infrastructure.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-26/mt-gox-shutdown-prompts-bitcoin-damage-control-efforts', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 26, 20, 14, 48, 884000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Mt. Gox Shutdown Prompts Bitcoin Damage Control Efforts'}, {'articleText': u'  Japanese authorities began investigating Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange that shut down this week, amid calls for regulation of the digital currency as customers face losses. The Financial Services Agency, Finance Ministry and police are examining the closure of Mt. Gox, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said today. Officials from the FSA, the ministry and the Bank of Japan said they didn\u2019t have responsibility for overseeing Bitcoin. Mt. Gox has been subpoenaed by U.S. prosecutors, the Wall Street Journal reported. Kolin Burges is among the customers who stand to lose their Bitcoins after Mt. Gox went offline amid reports that more than $390 million of the virtual currency may have been stolen. The news triggered renewed calls for more security and consumer protection from U.S. officials, while Democratic Party of Japan lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo called on his government to rectify the lack of regulation. \u201cThe authorities\u2019 stance that they don\u2019t have responsibility is disgraceful,\u201d Okubo, a former vice finance minister who also used to work at Morgan Stanley, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe need to establish a legal system.\u201d Bank of Japan board member Koji Ishida said he expects the government to make a proper decision on Bitcoin rules, including whether to embark on regulation. The digital currency has faced problems including the risk of money laundering and extreme price volatility, he told reporters today. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is in talks with Mt. Gox customers after it received inquiries from them, a police official said by phone, asking not to be named in accordance with department policy. \u201cI have 311 Bitcoins in there so I expect to lose those,\u201d said Burges, a trader of the digital currency who has been protesting outside Mt. Gox\u2019s office in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya district for more than a week. \u201cI will be finding out if there is any hope of recovering any coins and probably getting a lawyer to help with this.\u201d Karl-Friedrich Lenz, a law professor at Tokyo\u2019s Aoyama Gakuin University and a Mt. Gox customer, said the events at the exchange stem from the regulatory vacuum. \u201cThe Mt. Gox case is a good example of what happens if you ignore existing Japanese law requiring a bank license for taking deposits,\u201d said Lenz, adding that he has a \u201csmall amount\u201d at the exchange. \u201cSolid regulation is necessary\u201d for Bitcoin to be adopted more widely, he said. The Finance Ministry doesn\u2019t oversee Bitcoin because it\u2019s not defined as a currency under Japanese law, an official said. An FSA official said that while the agency isn\u2019t in charge of Bitcoin, it\u2019s collecting information and monitoring the matter. The BOJ isn\u2019t in a position to regulate the virtual currency, a central bank official said. The people all asked not to be named, citing their institutions\u2019 policies. Bitcoin prices surged 12 percent to $596.55 at 5:25 p.m. Tokyo time after slumping to as low as $418.78 yesterday, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Prices have retreated from as high as $1,151 on Dec. 4. Mt. Gox lost 744,408 Bitcoins, according to a document posted to the Internet that appeared to be an internal strategy paper. The exchange \u201ccan go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company,\u201d according to the paper, which was posted online by blogger Ryan Galt. A person briefed on the situation at the company, who asked to remain anonymous because the document is internal, said he believed it is authentic. It lists no contact information and no one has publicly verified its legitimacy at Mt. Gox, which hasn\u2019t answered an e-mail and voice message seeking comment today. The exchange went offline to \u201cprotect the site and our users,\u201d according to a statement on its website, which is otherwise blank. \u201cWe will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.\u201d Jimmy Wan, a 36 year old software engineer living in Tokyo, said he bought \u201cseveral\u201d coins from Mt. Gox after the exchange halted withdrawals earlier this month, hoping to take advantage of falling prices. \u201cIf the situation was healthy and Mt. Gox was down for maintenance, I would have thought there would be a more elegant way to notify your users instead of the just hitting the panic button,\u201d Wan said. He may acquire more Bitcoins from a different vendor, preferring to stash them in his own \u201cdigital mattress.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-26/bitcoin-holders-resigned-to-losses-as-mt-gox-faces-japan-probe', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 26, 9, 5, 53, 967000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Holders Resigned to Losses as Japan Probes Mt.

Just inside the front door, in a room anyone else might use as a den, he\u2019s placed a desk next to a fireplace that supports a massive monitor, with cables snaking right and left toward two computers, each about the size of a case of beer. Flickinger has spent more than $20,000 on these rigs and on a slower model that runs from the basement. They operate continuously, cranking out enough heat to warm the house and racking up $400 a month in electric bills. There isn\u2019t much by way of d\xe9cor, other than handwritten inspirational Post-it notes: \xa0\u201cI make money easily,\u201d one reads. \xa0\u201cMoney flows to me.\u201d\xa0\u201cI am a money magnet.\u201d \xa0Flickinger, 37, a software engineer and IT consultant by trade, doesn\u2019t leave the house much these days. He\u2019s a full-time Bitcoin miner.  Bitcoin is the digital currency that thrills nerds, inspires libertarians, and incites the passions of economists who debate the value of money made from nothing but ones and zeroes. Devotees watch the fluctuations of Bitcoin\u2019s price with a fanaticism typically reserved for college football scores. Alternative currency startups are being lavishly funded by venture capitalists while visionaries gush about the world-changing possibilities of money free from government control. Silicon Valley is the natural center for Bitcoin mania. An advocacy group named Arisebitcoin recently put up 40 billboards around the Bay Area with messages such as: \u201cThe Revolution has started\u2009\u2026\u2009where do you stand?\u201d As with an actual precious metal, Bitcoins are in limited supply\u2014they must be \u201cmined.\u201d Unlike with precious metals, this mining is done purely by computer. Miners set their machines to run a series of complex calculations that tally up and certify all the transactions of other Bitcoin holders around the world. If the miner\u2019s computers complete these calculations and solve a complex mathematical puzzle before anyone else, he earns about 25 Bitcoins as payment. It\u2019s a nice haul: With the price of each Bitcoin nosing up near $1,000, that\u2019s $25,000 for 10 minutes or so of work. For the moment at least, miners are the rare grunts who can also get rich. Over the past six months the price of a Bitcoin has shot up, dived, shot up again\u2014and kept on rising, making Bitcoin mining one of the most frenzied corners in technology. Engineers are racing to design and build unique chips that crunch Bitcoin algorithms at high speeds. Thousands of entrepreneurs like Flickinger are betting that their ability to harness these complex computer systems will make them rich\u2014and maybe create a new world order along the way. \n  Flickinger is part of a group called Give Me Coins that pools together its computing power to have a better shot at verifying transactions and solving the cryptographic puzzles first. He spends much of his time chatting online and monitoring his account on Give-Me-Coins.com, which shows the group\u2019s progress and his share in the work. His setup currently accounts for about 10 percent of its total computing muscle. One of the first things he does in the morning is check the temperature of his mining rigs. Processing chips calculate faster when they\u2019re hot, but not too hot\u2014the optimal temperature is around 73.5C (164.3F). If it goes much higher, the machine can overheat and malfunction, but Flickinger likes to push the limit. Occasionally, he says, he stuffs the air holes of his machines with paper to bring up the temperature. \u201cThere is serious money in this,\u201d he says, noting that he\u2019s earned 100 Bitcoins over the past few months from mining and other transactions. He estimates his two fastest computers will earn him $150,000 each this year. \u201cIt takes up a lot of time, but I have no kids. I have no life. I have a cat.\u201d\xa0\xa0The Bitcoin system was introduced in 2008 by a shadowy figure who went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. To this day no one knows if Nakamoto is a man or a woman or some sort of cabal, though few deny the ingenuity of the creation. Digital currencies had been devised before\u2014DigiCash and Bit Gold, for example\u2014and never took off. Nakamoto started with the best ideas behind these earlier currencies, added a few of his own, and wove it all together with technical elegance. The biggest achievement was solving a long-standing problem of borderless digital money: With no government oversight or central database to track transactions, how do you prevent fraud? Nakamoto\u2019s solution has two important parts. The first is a public ledger, shared across the Internet, which is a way to validate all Bitcoin transactions and eliminate counterfeiting. Every time someone makes a purchase or exchanges Bitcoin for another currency, that transaction is broadcast to anyone running open-source Bitcoin software. Some users run a highly specialized version of the software, which brings us to the second part of Nakamoto\u2019s solution: mining. Bitcoin miners are, in a sense, both maintainers of the public ledger and expanders of the virtual money supply. One more twist: The Bitcoin system makes sure the money supply expands gradually. The maximum number of minable Bitcoins worldwide is currently 25 every 10 minutes. It\u2019s like a worldwide math competition that resets six times an hour. There are a total of 21 million possible Bitcoins; about half are currently in circulation. The last will be mined in about 2140 at the earliest. Nakamato\u2019s puzzles\u2014akin to searches in a digital haystack for fiendishly long numbers preceded by strings of zeroes\u2014were easy to solve at first. Miners used standard laptops and desktops to complete calculations and earn their Bitcoins. The currency was mined and traded in small volumes and relative obscurity. It garnered attention as a popular method of payment on the online black market Silk Road, a bazaar for illegal drugs, and for the enthusiasm of high-profile backers such as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers better known as Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s legal adversaries. It\u2019s accepted as payment by online dating service OKCupid, at a cafe in the Netherlands, and by Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic. There\u2019s now a Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver and another one planned for Hong Kong. As the currency has gathered momentum, miners have piled in. But, because Nakamoto\u2019s puzzles are designed to get more difficult over time, solving them requires ever-escalating computing capacity. It\u2019s an ingenious trick, like a Rubik\u2019s cube that gets more complicated as more people try to solve it. By 2010 the puzzles grew too difficult for ordinary desktops. Miners needed souped-up systems with fast graphics processors, typically used for playing high-performance video games or conducting intense scientific research, or they needed to distribute the problem among dozens of computers at once. It\u2019s not clear whether Bitcoin\u2019s inventor, who disappeared from the Internet in mid-2010, was prophetic enough to imagine what happened last year. The value of Bitcoin exploded, with the price of an individual coin jumping from $100 in July to $200 in October to more than $1,000 as of this month. Economist Paul Krugman, among many other critics wearing the dour goggles of history, argued that it was little more than the latest speculative mania, no less ridiculous than the Dutch fever for tulips in the 17th century. But the miners showed up anyway. And an industry of microprocessor manufacturers has sprung up to serve them. No matter what the fate of Bitcoin, one consequence of the race to mine it will probably be faster chips. \xa0\xa0In July 2013, an anonymous geek going by the name Bitfury proposed a chip design tailored to the problem of mining Bitcoins. Little is known about Bitfury; collaborators say he\u2019s a brainy Ukrainian now living in Russia who taught himself microprocessor engineering and designed his chip by hand at his kitchen table. Dave Carlson, a serial entrepreneur from Seattle, says he first met Bitfury in an online forum devoted to Bitcoin. Backed by a Polish investor, Carlson and Bitfury started a company called MegaBigPower, selling computers based on Bitfury\u2019s chips for as much as $11,000 each. Carlson says he\u2019s never actually seen his partner in person, but they\u2019ve formed a frenetic, virtual working relationship. \u201cWe had a Skype session that never closed for two months,\u201d says Carlson. \u201cIt was like a war room.\u201d Carlson also operates what he says is North America\u2019s largest Bitcoin mine, an array of Bitfury-designed rigs in a warehouse. Inside the facility, which is in the Pacific Northwest\u2014he asks that the exact location remain undisclosed\u2014row after row of Bitcoin computers sit on cheap metal racks he bought at Home Depot. Industrial fans on the floor keep the machines cool. Carlson says he generates 100 to 300 Bitcoins a day, and he\u2019s hanging on to them because he believes their value will only increase. \n  Carlson plans to sell sophisticated Bitfury arrays to other Bitcoin enthusiasts, charging upwards of $1 million for a mine that can mint $150,000 in Bitcoin a day. He needs the money. He\u2019s still recovering financially from his previous venture, an advertising firm that collapsed, and is so strapped for conventional money he may lose his house. Still, he\u2019s not willing to cash out of his mined currency. \u201cI am riding this Bitcoin wave,\u201d he says. Eduardo de Castro runs HashFast Technologies, a mining startup founded in early 2013. Sitting in a cafe in Mountain View, Calif., in September, de Castro, too, displays feverish signs: He had a house fire the night before, which he mentions dismissively only after being asked about the bandages on his arms and face. His company is sprinting to design, manufacture, and sell specialized high-performance computers to Bitcoin miners. At the heart of the computers made by HashFast and similar startups such as KnCMiner and Butterfly Labs is a chip known as an ASIC, or an application specific integrated circuit. Unlike the general purpose Intel chip powering a PC or an ARM processor in a smartphone, an ASIC typically performs a single function extremely well. A security company might make an ASIC to speed up the encryption of data, for example. For Bitcoin-mining toolmakers like HashFast, the goal is to make an ASIC that is precisely tuned to crunch Nakamoto\u2019s algorithms. \u201cIt would take 70,000 of Intel\u2019s fastest chips to match one of ours,\u201d de Castro says. A typical company might take a year to 18 months to design and manufacture such a custom chip. De Castro and his partner, Simon Barber, a former engineer at the Palo Alto Research Center, tried to pull it off in a few months. They hired a team of 20 engineers and consultants and hunkered down for weeks in the offices of a local chip design consulting firm. Bills for those services ran into the millions, though HashFast had raised only $600,000 from friends and family. (Several family members balked at investing in what they called \u201cMonopoly money,\u201d de Castro says.) The HashFast partners raised the rest by preselling $15 million worth of mining rigs on the idea alone, without even a prototype. Naturally, the company took payment in Bitcoin. \n  It was a perilous move. Customers, for example, could pay the equivalent of $5,000 upfront for a HashFast machine. As the price of Bitcoin tripled during the year, they discovered they had paid $15,000. Worse, Bitcoin\u2019s increasing value drew more interest to mining, which made the field even more crowded and lowered the odds of solving the underlying puzzles. De Castro is confident his computers will still be profitable for customers and cheerfully calls his strategy \u201caiming the car straight at the biggest wall we could find and gunning it.\u201d HashFast promised delivery of its systems by the end of the year and missed its own deadline. De Castro, still optimistic, cites production delays but says they are close to shipping units. Meanwhile, the company faces angry customers, demands for refunds, constant complaints on Bitcoin bulletin boards, and threats of a lawsuit. In August, Austin (Tex.)-based CoinTerra announced two Bitcoin computer designs, which it dubbed GoldStrike and TerraMiner. So far the company has $20 million in presales. Ravi Iyengar, a veteran chip designer, runs the startup. Iyengar has worked at Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and, most recently, Samsung, where he led a team that developed chips for the company\u2019s phones and tablets. After hearing about Bitcoin, Iyengar quit his job to use his experience to outrace other Bitcoin-mining startups. Iyengar has watched Intel, IBM, Apple, Samsung, and other heavyweights slug it out in the chip business for years. \u201cNo arms race in the history of the chip industry even comes close to this,\u201d he says. The most secretive of the new mining companies is Silicon Valley-based 21e6; its name refers to the scientific notation for 21 million, the maximum number of Bitcoins. According to regulatory filings, the startup raised $5 million in April to build what\u2019s believed to be one of the fastest mining chips in the world. Among investors are the Winklevoss twins; Marc Andreessen and his venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz; early Tesla Motors backer Bill Lee; PayPal mafia member David Sacks; and Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, a social network for investors and entrepreneurs. (Bloomberg LP, the parent of this magazine, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz.) Balaji Srinivasan, a former lecturer of computational biology at Stanford University, is one of the founders of 21e6. He also runs a Bitcoin club at Stanford for students and faculty and last month became a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. Srinivasan made headlines in October when he suggested at an industry forum that Silicon Valley secede from the U.S. He now says he was misquoted and meant only that avid technologists should forge their own Internet-centric communities. \u201cImagine a society of Inverse Amish that lives nearby, peacefully, in the future,\u201d he wrote recently in a blog post. \u201cA place where Google Glass wearers are normal, where self-driving cars and delivery drones aren\u2019t restricted by law, and where we can experiment with new technologies without causing undue disruption to others.\u201d Srinivasan says Bitcoin would be useful to the Inverse Amish. In an interview, he calls the currency \u201cthe missing piece of the Internet\u201d that will make transactions frictionless. Yet when he\u2019s asked about 21e6, Srinivasan goes silent. A PR representative interrupts to say that the company is in stealth mode. People familiar with 21e6, who asked not to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak on the matter, say the company plans to keep its superfast computers for itself, just as a hedge fund might trade on its own proprietary algorithms. It wants to build the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mine\u2014a virtual money printing machine. \xa0\xa0Supermine projects like 21e6 wrap up all the promise and danger of the libertarian sensibility that underlies Bitcoin. For HashFast and other miners, trying to corner the market in the world\u2019s most successful virtual currency is a Dr. Evil-patting-the-cat move. Bitcoin true believers will tell you they aren\u2019t\u2014or aren\u2019t completely\u2014about the money. They dream of building a system free from the narrow interests of governments or the wealthy, allowing individuals greater freedom to move their capital around, whether it\u2019s to avoid credit card fees, shop anonymously, or evade repressive regimes. The fear is that an organization with piles of capital and not much idealism can buy enough computational might to corner the market and box out the individual miner. That may already be happening: Websites such as Bitcoin Watch that track the total computing power of miners have started to show large, mysterious spikes in capacity. Even some Bitcoin entrepreneurs think mining has become a sucker\u2019s game. Fred Ehrsam is a former Goldman Sachs trader and co-founder of Coinbase, a Bitcoin startup making wallet software that allows people to trade and store Bitcoins, and which recently raised $25 million in venture capital. Ehrsam is committed to Bitcoin but pessimistic about underfunded prospectors making any money. \u201cThis is very much a fad that is going to die soon, if it\u2019s not even dead already,\u201d he says. But that\u2019s not the same as saying individual mining will end. He suggests that the next generation of miners might run their computers for ideological purposes\u2014to support the currency and be a disruptive force in global finance\u2014even if doing so has become unprofitable. \n  \u201cMining was supposed to be a democratized thing, but it\u2019s now only accessible to the elite of the elites,\u201d says Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple Labs, which has introduced a virtual currency called Ripple. It\u2019s similar to Bitcoin but without the mining. (The company gradually hands out increments of the currency to supporters.) \u201cHordes of brilliant engineers are raising money for mining equipment that regular folks can\u2019t compete with,\u201d Larsen says. For idealists not swimming in startup capital, it\u2019s still possible to join the Bitcoin rush, mostly by adding power to a distributed array of processors. Craigslist is full of miners selling their old rigs, and there are peripherals that cost about $250\u2014they look like USB thumb drives, plug into standard PCs, and are mostly ineffective. Online calculator sites like BitcoinX let prospective miners enter processor speed, current Bitcoin exchange rate, electricity costs, and other variables to figure out whether their investment makes any financial sense. Most of these calculators suggest that even miners with older, specialized Bitcoin machines can still make a little money as long as the price for a Bitcoin is above $700. Members of mining groups are rewarded according to the amount of work they contribute. \n  That\u2019s basically Flickinger\u2019s arrangement with Give Me Coins. The collective has dozens of members scattered around the world and successfully mines Bitcoins every few days. Flickinger says he\u2019s uneasy about the volatility of Bitcoin prices, which dropped 20 percent in the month after Beijing said it was banning Chinese payment processors from working in the currency.

Nakamoto, a 64-year-old physicist who denied a report last week by Newsweek magazine that identified him as the digital currency\u2019s creator. A wallet address set up by Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer for Blockchain.info, received more than 1,800 payments, amounting to about 44 bitcoins, according to data on his company\u2019s website. That compares with about 1 million coins that the founder of the system owns, worth over $1 billion when the price peaked in December, according to Jered Kenna, a San Francisco-based Bitcoin investor. The naming of Dorian Nakamoto drew media attention that resulted in the former defense industry and government employee being chased by reporters through Los Angeles. Bitcoin supporters expressed outrage at what they saw as a violation of his privacy and further evidence of news media bias against the nascent digital currency that last month suffered the collapse of one of its largest exchanges. \u201cIf this person is not Satoshi, then these funds will serve as a \u2018sorry for what happened to you\u2019,\u201d Antonopoulos wrote in a post on the Reddit social media website on March 8. \u201cIt serves to soften the damage caused by irresponsible journalism and to demonstrate the generosity and empathy of the community.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic origins resulted in anonymity being built into the payment protocol and a community that prizes privacy. These same features prompted regulators worldwide to express concern the digital currency may be used for money-laundering and illicit sales, such as the online Silk Road website where customers used coins to buy and sell drugs. The virtual currency was in the spotlight again last month when Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the biggest exchange for the digital currency, filed for bankruptcy protection after coins valued at more than $500 million went missing. U.S. federal prosecutors are probing possible criminal violations tied to the shutdown, two people familiar with the matter said Feb. 26. Satoshi Nakamoto has been thought to be a pseudonym for a programmer or group of programmers who wrote the paper and the initial source code for Bitcoin. The code has since been handed off to a loose group of experts affiliated with the Bitcoin Foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group. Gavin Andresen, the foundation\u2019s chief scientist who had been one of the few people to communicate with Satoshi Nakamoto, didn\u2019t immediately indicate whether he could identify Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin\u2019s creator. Andresen said in a message on Twitter that he was disappointed that Newsweek decided to \u201cdox,\u201d or document, the Nakamoto family. Donations will be converted to U.S. dollars at the end of March and will be offered to Nakamoto, or his charity of choice, Antonopoulos said in the post.

Shrem, 24, is the former vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an industry representative to regulators formed to oversee the currency\u2019s software protocol. He and a co-defendant, Robert Faiella, are accused of engaging in a scheme to sell Bitcoins to users of Silk Road, which allowed customers to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously and beyond the reach of law enforcement authorities. The case against Shrem, who was charged in January, is the latest to be brought by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stemming from the Silk Road probe. Ross William Ulbricht was charged in October with running Silk Road under the alias \u201cDread Pirate Roberts.\u201d In December, Bharara charged three more former Silk Road employees with helping run the website. All have pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court, where the cases are pending. This is the second 30-day postponement prosecutors have requested in Shrem\u2019s case. He was arrested at John F.

Washington-based Peck Madigan Jones had five of its lobbyists, including Jeff Peck, who leads the firm\u2019s financial services and capital markets practice, work on subjects including \u201cbitcoin and mobile payments\u201d in the House of Representatives and Senate during the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing. Other topics the firm handled for MasterCard included data breaches, interchange fees and gift cards. As big financial companies dismiss bitcoin\u2019s prospects, the document shows MasterCard is at least talking with lawmakers about the virtual currency, which entrepreneurs pitch as a cheap alternative to established payment systems. Investors in bitcoin businesses are working to head off burdensome regulation and capture some of the combined $61.3 billion in annual revenue generated by the four largest U.S. credit-card networks. \u201cWe were gathering information in connection with recent congressional hearings to better understand the policy issues around virtual and anonymous currencies,\u201d said Jim Issokson, a spokesman for Purchase, New York-based MasterCard. Peck Madigan Jones lobbies for financial-industry clients including Deutsche Bank AG and Wells Fargo & Co. Lobbyists working for Visa Inc. and American Express Co. didn\u2019t mention bitcoin in their quarterly filings. \u201cIt is safe to assume that an incumbent payment-network provider would want to make sure bitcoin-based payment businesses are subject to the same level of regulatory scrutiny as the incumbent networks and their member banks,\u201d said Gil Luria, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities Inc. Paul Cohen, a spokesman for Foster City, California-based Visa, and Marina Norville at New York-based AmEx declined to comment. The about $70,000 paid to Peck Madigan Jones is dwarfed by the $4.1 million MasterCard and affiliates spent on lobbying last year, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Regulators worldwide are starting to impose rules on digital currencies such as bitcoin, and federal and state officials are set to provide more guidance in coming months. Bankers including JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Some of his members want him to focus on a less lofty goal: helping them make lots of old-fashioned cash. Matonis, a longtime advocate of what he calls \u201cnon-political money,\u201d has built the group into a kind of a bitcoin governing body. Early this month he hired a Washington lobby firm, and today he unveiled a website aimed at raising the virtual currency\u2019s public profile. Some foundation members are dismayed by Matonis\u2019 leadership and grander plans. Investors from Silicon Valley in particular would like the group to focus on more technical matters, particularly fortifying the underlying bitcoin software so it can grow into a viable, large-scale payment network. Running the foundation is like \u201cgoing downhill in a go-cart trying to keep the wheels on,\u201d Matonis said in an interview today. \u201cThere are different constituencies going in different directions.\u201d Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, lured by the technology\u2019s promise, have plowed time and money into bitcoin businesses -- and they\u2019re demanding software upgrades to develop the digital currency\u2019s commercial potential. \u201cThe impact of the bitcoin protocol is economic,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, chief executive of Circle Internet Financial, a Boston-based bitcoin startup, said in an interview. \u201cThese are higher stakes than with other open-source software.\u201d The organization, established in 2012 and modeled on the Linux Foundation, the open-source operating system created in the early 1990s, has tried to mix stewardship of the code with political advocacy. Unlike Linux, bitcoin rapidly became a channel for billions of dollars in transactions, making security and capacity bottom-line issues for entrepreneurs. Matonis said that pressure to invest more in bitcoin\u2019s computer code reflects a \u201cfight over who controls the policy dialogue,\u201d and whether the group will continue to fund lobbying. \u201cTech investors want to make sure that all the resources in the world are there on the tech side,\u201d he said. Bitcoins are part of a software system that transfers digital assets from owner to owner without using a third party. Startups are seeking to use the innovation to disrupt the existing payment system dominated by firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., Visa Inc. and Western Union Co. The core software managed by the foundation contains instructions that let computers communicate with one another to verify transactions on bitcoin\u2019s public ledger, called the blockchain. Another program enables users to conduct those transactions. Software upgrades are made through an informal system of mostly part-time developers who communicate in Internet chat rooms. Gavin Andresen, the foundation\u2019s chief scientist, was until May the only paid coder working on bitcoin. Online discussions sometimes devolve into virtual shouting matches, according to Andresen. This year, the bitcoin network processed between $20 million and $580 million per day in transactions, according to the data aggregated on blockchain.info. \u201cThis is not sustainable,\u201d said Mike Hearn, one of bitcoin\u2019s core developers. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an infrastructure held together by chewing gum and sticky tape and people who work evenings and weekends.\u201d Software upgrades have helped ward off hacking and increased commercial utility. A change in March, for example, improved the security of transactions conducted through online merchants by adapting bitcoin software to the Internet\u2019s existing system for authenticating websites. That tweak pales in comparison to the \u201cnon-trivial problem\u201d of raising the number of transactions the bitcoin network can process, Allaire said. The system can handle about nine transactions per second, far off the roughly 2,400 on Visa\u2019s network. Investors have raised the idea of earmarking donations to the foundation for work on the software. \u201cA lot of people would give a million dollars if it would go solely to development,\u201d said Brock Pierce, a venture capitalist who was recently elected to the foundation\u2019s board. Under pressure from the entrepreneur side, the foundation has commissioned a \u201cfeasibility study\u201d to determine whether the software development could happen as part of a partnership with a major university, Matonis said. Or, it could be spun out into a separate body with its own finances, something Matonis said he doesn\u2019t support. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the underlying core development, it diminishes the other policy and advocacy work we do,\u201d he said. Matonis has frequently argued that bitcoin is a political project that will displace money issued by governments, and has at times disavowed close work with regulators. \u201cThe Foundation is not pro-regulation as some have claimed, but it is pro-education,\u201d he wrote when he became its director in 2012. He has dismissed money laundering as an overly broad category of crime, \u201clike buying a drive-thru donut in a stolen vehicle.\u201d He once wrote that being a customer of bitcoin companies that work with regulators to stop crime \u201cfeels like buying weed from the Drug Enforcement Administration.\u201d Under Matonis, the foundation has hired a new Washington-based global policy counsel, Jim Harper of the libertarian Cato Institution. And this month, it retained Thorsen French Advocacy, a Washington lobbying firm. Many entrepreneurs are keen to dodge the politics that Matonis courts. Nic Cary, the chief executive officer of Blockchain, the largest website for creating digital wallets to hold bitcoins, said the group should improve software and promote consumer adoption of the virtual currency. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a lot of mission creep,\u201d Cary said. \u201cWe need to fund the people who are working on development.\u201d Allaire\u2019s Circle Internet Financial has shareholders including Accel Partners, a venture-capital firm based in Palo Alto, California, and Pantera Capital Management LP, a San Francisco hedge fund backed by Fortress Investment Group. Venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Index Ventures also put money into bitcoin companies. Matonis and the other founders of the group have rules on their side. They set up a system in which individual members elect the same number of board members -- three -- as do all the corporate members. That has raised the possibility, mentioned by Matonis at a meeting in Amsterdam in May, that the foundation could split. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an early Internet advocacy group, spun out the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology in 1994 after similar conflicts. Matonis told his members that he won\u2019t go quietly if the Bitcoin Foundation cracks. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to fracture,\u201d Matonis said in May, \u201cI want to make sure I\u2019m running the one we remember.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-30/bitcoin-up-washington-profile-to-silicon-valley-s-dismay', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 30, 18, 36, 4, 286000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Up Washington Profile to Silicon Valley\u2019s Dismay'}, {'articleText': u'  Xapo, a provider of secure online storage for bitcoins, said it doubled the amount of money it has raised from investors to $40 million, the most gathered by a startup focused on the virtual currency.

Being digital, bitcoins aren\u2019t tangible -- which has become a boon for George Frey. \u201cI\u2019ve sort of cornered the market on bitcoin photos,\u201d the Provo, Utah\u2013based photographer says in the November issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine. Indeed, dozens of media outlets, including Bloomberg News, have published Frey\u2019s pictures. The image used here -- dated April 26, 2013 -- happens to rank as the most popular bitcoin photograph on Gettyimages.com. But if a bitcoin isn\u2019t a physical object, what exactly are we looking at in Frey\u2019s photographs? They\u2019re called Casascius bitcoins, and they were minted, in a variety of metals, by software engineer Mike Caldwell at his home in Sandy, Utah. An early bitcoin adopter, Caldwell wanted to help popularize the cryptocurrency -- but he, too, grappled with its intangibility. \u201cNo one is going to get this if I can\u2019t show them something,\u201d Caldwell remembers thinking. So in September 2011, he began making physical coins as vessels. Inside of each, he embedded a piece of paper that contained a bitcoin private key, which he protected with a tamper-resistant hologram sticker. As for the word casascius, it was half acronym (derived from the phrase \u201ccall a spade a spade\u201d), half Latin-sounding suffix (\u201ccius\u201d). As of Nov. 27, 2013, however, Caldwell no longer includes digital bitcoins in his physical bitcoins. A letter from the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, stopped him in his tracks: FinCEN considered his activity to be money transmitting and informed him that he lacked the necessary license. Since then, Caldwell has sold only aluminum promo coins via his website, Casascius.com. A bag of 500 costs 0.39 bitcoin -- about $150, as of yesterday. All told, Caldwell minted about 60,000 Casascius bitcoins. Bitcoin enthusiasts consider them collectibles -- especially the earliest ones, which have fetched as much as $2,500 each on EBay because of a typo in the hologram. Not that much of this matters to Frey, whose photos continue to be downloaded via Getty. Frey says he\u2019s made more than $10,000 off the images, which he shot at Caldwell\u2019s home.

Popular Photograph Has Story'}, {'articleText': u' A key figure is missing in the court documents outlining the biggest computer attack ever of the U.S. financial system: the actual hacker. The Israeli mastermind of the crime syndicate with global operations -- computer servers in Egypt, online casinos in Ukraine and Hungary, Azerbaijan payment processors and a Florida bitcoin exchange -- created a digital mob without a true home country, according to prosecutors. So when the gang needed a hired gun, in this case a sophisticated computer thief, it apparently turned to a harbor known for some of the best. The hacker, identified only as co-conspirator 1 in a sweeping indictment unsealed on Tuesday, is actually a Russian master of digital break-ins known to federal agents and U.S. spy agencies who have tracked him for years, according to three people familiar with the investigation. Another indictment unsealed this week about the gang provides a little more, citing \u201ca computer hacker who is believed to have resided in Russia\u201d -- one who infiltrated computer networks, located customer databases and exported the profile information to computers overseas. It is not unusual for prosecutors to withhold names in a continuing investigation. But talks about whether to publicly identify the hacker in this case and whether to indict him reached the upper rungs of government. The prospect was the subject of various discussions at one point by officials of the National Security Agency and the White House, according to one person familiar with the matter, who said it was part of a larger debate within the Administration over how best to confront Russia over hacking amid strained U.S. relations. "I think the government\u2019s weighing its options at this point," said Leo Taddeo, a former special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s cyber division in New York who supervised the case before he left in August and who declined to discuss its specifics. Sometimes, the names of co-conspirators are withheld in hopes they won\u2019t go into hiding and will be easier to apprehend, said Taddeo, now chief security officer of cybersecurity company Cryptzone Inc. in Waltham, Massachusetts. That is less of a concern in this hacking case, since the arrest and indictment of other suspects, along with the seizure of e-mails and other communications, have already alerted the hacker that U.S. authorities are on his trail. The FBI declined to comment on the investigation, as did the White House National Security Council. The NSA didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department, which makes decisions on criminal actions independent of the executive branch, also declined to comment. The FBI\u2019s assessment that the financial hack and related events were purely a criminal caper, not the act of an unfriendly government, has largely been borne out by the investigation. Still, American intelligence agencies have produced information suggesting co-conspirator 1 may enjoy the protection of the FSB, Russia\u2019s main intelligence agency, two people briefed on the matter said. The information is not all consistent. Some intelligence suggests merely that the FSB tried to recruit the hacker, while other information indicates he may have had a more active role in FSB-directed operations, they said. The hacker\u2019s profile helped feed differences of opinion early on about the attacks of some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest names. For months after the disclosure of a big systems breach last summer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. officials maintained the attack on the bank should be treated as a national security incident. "Proving that a nation-state was not involved in this is very, very difficult, if not impossible," Taddeo said, adding that the indictment lays out a clear criminal motivation, not a national campaign. Co-conspirator 1\u2019s shadowy talents are on display throughout the two indictments, one in federal court in New York and the other in Atlanta. He appears to infiltrate some American financial institutions with ease, operating undetected inside their heavily secured computer banks for months or years. Targeted companies included Fidelity Investments, E*Trade Financial Corp., Scottrade Financial Services Inc., Dow Jones & Co., as well as JPMorgan Chase, which alone spends more than half a billion dollars annually to secure its computers. Fidelity is the one company in this group that has said it has no indication any customer information was taken from its network. Some of the targets were chosen by Gery Shalon, the Israeli who was the mastermind of the criminal organization spanning bitcoin companies, Internet gambling sites and securities manipulation before his arrest last summer, according to the criminal indictments. Transcripts of e-mail communications show Shalon trying to explain the rudiments of pump-and-dump stock schemes to the hacker, telling co-conspirator 1 -- in presumably familiar terms -- that buying stocks in America is like "drinking freaking vodka in Russia." Specialists say co-conspirator 1 may have done more than what Shalon ordered and point out that he remained in the computers of some companies for years, even though e-mail addresses and such can be spirited away quickly. For example, when disclosing that some customer payment information may have been compromised in October, Dow Jones said that the unauthorized access to its systems occurred at certain times over three years. Data stolen from the targets might also have been shared with others in Russia, if that is where the hacker is working, for his own protection, said Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer for Trend Micro Inc. "This is not over," Kellermann said. "The real question now is how many backdoors are still in these systems that have yet to be detected." U.S. authorities almost always hit a dead end, Taddeo said, when an investigation leads to Russia. With Shalon and some other suspects in custody, however, prosecutors may be able to plumb the inner workings of Russia\u2019s elite cyber underground. At least two of Shalon\u2019s alleged associates, Joshua Aaron and bitcoin operator Anthony Murgio, traveled extensively to Russia and could have met the hacker in person. Aaron remains a fugitive, but pictures posted to his wife\u2019s social media account just before Shalon\u2019s arrest in July put his last location in St. Petersburg, Russia. Shalon and Aaron couldn\u2019t be reached for comment and Gregory Kehoe, a lawyer representing Murgio, didn\u2019t return a phone message.

A revised leverage-ratio plan is set to be laxer than a draft published last year by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, said a person familiar with the scope of a Jan. 12 meeting of the group\u2019s oversight body at which the measure will be discussed. Leverage ratios are designed to curb banks\u2019 reliance on debt by setting a minimum standard for how much capital they must hold as a percentage of all assets on their books. A quarter of large global lenders would have failed to meet the draft version of the leverage limit had it been in force at the end of 2012, according to data published by the committee in September. Some supervisors have called for greater use of leverage ratios instead of standard Basel capital requirements, which are measured as a ratio of banks\u2019 equity against risk-weighted assets, because banks are inconsistent in the way they calculate these standards. The draft leverage rule published last year would have required banks to hold capital equivalent to at least 3 percent of their assets, without any possibility to take into account the riskiness of their investments. The Basel committee declined to comment on the leverage ratio talks. The leverage measure is the main item on the agenda for the Jan. 12 meeting, according to people familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Under the published Basel timetable, banks will be expected to publicly disclose how well they measure up to the standard from 2015, with the rule to become a binding minimum standard in 2018. Bitcoin Tax Rules Needed for Clarity, Taxpayer Advocate Says The U.S. Internal Revenue Service should give taxpayers clear rules on how it will handle transactions involving Bitcoin and other digital currencies, Nina Olson, the National Taxpayer Advocate, said Jan. 10. Spending Bitcoins to purchase goods may trigger capital gains and losses or ordinary income and losses, which have different tax rates, Olson said in her annual report to Congress. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s responsibility to inform the public about the rules they are required to follow,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe lack of clear answers to basic questions such as when and how taxpayers should report gains and losses on digital currency transactions probably encourages tax avoidance.\u201d Olson, who runs an independent office within the IRS, listed digital currency as one of the 25 most serious issues encountered by taxpayers. Atop Olson\u2019s list was the absence of a clear set of taxpayer rights and the decline in IRS service and enforcement stemming from budget cuts, issues on which she has repeatedly urged change.

Ex-Trader Faces Charges in Biggest U.K. Insider-Trades Probe Julian Rifat, a former trader at Moore Capital Management LLC, will be charged as soon as this month in the U.K.\u2019s biggest insider-trading case, according to two people with knowledge of the case. Rifat, who was arrested almost four years ago, will be charged by the Financial Conduct Authority no later than early next month, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn\u2019t public. His lawyer was told by the regulator Jan. 9 that he will be charged soon, the other person said. A hearing for Rifat at a London criminal court scheduled for Jan. 10 was canceled. The U.K. authority stepped up its efforts to prosecute insider trading in the wake of the financial crisis. Rifat will be the ninth person to be charged in the case, known as Operation Tabernula. He was an execution trader in the London office of Moore Capital, a New York-based firm that oversees about $12 billion. Rifat was taken into custody in 2010 and has been under investigation since. His lawyer didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Eight other men have been charged in the probe. At a private hearing in November over Rifat\u2019s assets, a judge told the FCA to decide whether it was going to charge Rifat by Jan. 10, according to one of the people. Ex-SAC Trader Says He Feared Losing Job Over Drug Trial News Mathew Martoma\u2019s former SAC Capital Advisors LP trader testified he came to work on July 29, 2008, thinking he and his boss might lose their jobs because of losses he thought had occurred in their portfolio. The former trader, Timothy Jandovitz, who was the first witness called by prosecutors in Martoma\u2019s insider-trading trial on Jan. 11, told jurors he believed that bad news about a clinical drug trial had caused losses in the fund managed by Martoma \u201cnorth of $100 million,\u201d and he feared for the security of his job as well as Martoma\u2019s. What Jandovitz didn\u2019t know was that SAC had liquidated a $700 million position in shares of Wyeth and Elan Corp. the week before the announcement, according to prosecutors. SAC gained $276 million from trades based on the illegal tips about tests of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment, said prosecutors, who have called it the most lucrative insider-trading scheme in history. Jandovitz said Martoma later told him that SAC founder and owner Steve Cohen had directed Martoma not to tell him about the decision to sell the stock. Prosecutors claim Martoma used inside information from two doctors supervising the drug trial to allow SAC to sell its position before the bad news was announced publicly. If convicted of securities fraud, he faces as long as 20 years in prison. Jandovitz\u2019s testimony came after lawyers for both sides gave their opening statements. Assistant U.S. Attorney Arlo Devlin-Brown told jurors that Martoma \u201ccorrupted\u201d a doctor overseeing the trial in order to get inside information and trade on the illegal tips. Martoma \u201csought out an illegal edge,\u201d Devlin-Brown said. \u201cUltimately, this case is not about scientific testing and it\u2019s not about trading. The case is about cheating.\u201d Richard Strassberg, an attorney for Martoma, told jurors his client is \u201can innocent man. Mathew Martoma did not commit these charges.\u201d \u201cThere were many, many independent reasons to sell Elan and Wyeth stock in July 2008,\u201d Strassberg said about SAC Capital\u2019s decision to liquidate its holdings in the two stocks. \u201cInside information was not one of them.\u201d The case is U.S. v. Martoma, 12-cr-00973, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Infinium Capital Accused of Fraud in Ex-Workers\u2019 Lawsuit Infinium Capital Management LLC, a Chicago-based high-frequency trading firm, was sued by former employees who claim they were tricked into swapping loans to a company affiliate for equity, causing them to lose $4 million. The defendants, including six of the company\u2019s executives, failed to disclose to the employees Infinium\u2019s true financial condition, including executive redemption obligations that wiped out the 31 workers\u2019 investments, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Chicago on Jan. 7. On its website, Infinium says it trades and makes markets electronically, on exchange floors and over the counter, 23 1/2 hours a day, six days a week. Tabb said Infinium was a top-25 high-frequency firm. Firm President Mark Palchak, who isn\u2019t a defendant in the case, didn\u2019t immediately reply to a telephone message seeking comment on the former workers\u2019 allegations. There was no reply to an e-mailed request for comment sent to Infinium\u2019s general mailbox. The workers accuse the businesses and the individual defendants of securities fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and common law fraud. They seek return of their lost money, plus interest and punitive damages.

German Pick at ECB Means Power Over Banks as Rate Sway Slips In sending Sabine Lautenschlaeger to the board of the European Central Bank, Germany could be gaining power over the region\u2019s lenders at the expense of its monetary-policy clout. Lautenschlaeger, the only candidate to succeed Joerg Asmussen after he quit the ECB for the German government, will testify today before European Parliament lawmakers already keen to raise the number of women on the board from zero to one. A fast-tracked procedure could see her shift across Frankfurt to the ECB from her current job as vice president and head of supervision at the Bundesbank by the end of the month. That would change the tone of Germany\u2019s voice at the ECB, as the 49-year-old\u2019s profile is that of an experienced scrutinizer of bank balance sheets, not an economics heavyweight. It means the nation, which has been overridden more than once on interest rates and measures to quell the debt crisis, could instead push its agenda for redesigning Europe\u2019s financial system to prevent a repeat of the turmoil since 2007. As Europe builds a banking union, Germany has fought for nations to retain more control than foreseen in plans presented by the European Commission and backed by the ECB. Finance ministers reached a deal last month on a blueprint to create a single system for handling crisis-hit lenders by acceding to German demands. Lautenschlaeger, who declined to comment, has backed the German position as a pragmatic way forward. The European Parliament and Greece, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, started negotiations on the final version of the rules this month, amid warnings from the assembly that the approach agreed on by national governments is too cumbersome to work. Lautenschlaeger has almost two decades of experience overseeing German banks.

The IRS hasn\u2019t offered guidance on Bitcoin, beyond saying that it is working on the issue and that it has been monitoring digital currencies and transactions since 2007. The IRS today reiterated a statement it issued in December. \u201cThe IRS is aware of the potential tax compliance risks posed by virtual currencies,\u201d it said in the statement. \u201cThe IRS continues to study virtual currencies and intends to provide some guidance on the tax consequences of virtual currency transactions.\u201d According to Olson\u2019s report, a big distinction for the IRS to make is whether Bitcoin is property, in which case capital gains rules would apply with a top basic rate of 20 percent.

The IRS can\u2019t outlaw Bitcoin, said Joshua Blank, a tax law professor at New York University. It can use past experience to require information reporting about transactions.

Pantera Capital Management, a San Francisco hedge fund backed by Fortress Investment Group, and SecondMarket Inc., a New York brokerage, are among those seeking to buy bitcoins from the U.S. government at an auction scheduled for June 27. A broad swath of interested parties, from individuals to institutional investors, have requested information from the U.S. Marshals Service, which is handling the sale. \u201cI know of small and large investors who are talking about investing in this,\u201d said Jaron Lukasiewicz, chief executive officer of Coinsetter Inc., a New York-based exchange. \u201cAnd there are probably some hidden players out there -- hedge funds who are looking to get into the market.\u201d The auction of 29,656 bitcoins, part of more than 144,000 the FBI transferred to U.S. Marshals after shutting down the Silk Road marketplace and arrested its operator last year, represents a rare opportunity to secure a large amount of the virtual currency. Because liquidity on the exchanges is low -- a trade of 500 bitcoins can move prices -- buying from the government offers a chance to avoid paying a premium. \u201cIf an investor wanted to buy this much bitcoin all at once in the open market, they could bid the price of bitcoin up by 10 to 20 percent by simply filling out that trade,\u201d said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. Mark Williams, a former bank examiner and now lecturer at Boston University, said the interest from Pantera and SecondMarket amounts to \u201ca speculative bet, not of new buyers, but the same market promoters.\u201d \u201cThis auction doesn\u2019t validate Bitcoin but simply demonstrated that the U.S. government is anxious to get out before prices drop again,\u201d Williams wrote in an e-mail. \u201cThe U.S. Marshals Service has over 29,000 reasons to sell by private auction and sell now.\u201d Bidders are required to deposit $200,000 and verify their identities. The U.S. Marshals will notify the winner or winners on June 30. More bitcoins may be sold later, the agency has said. The sale excludes bitcoins the government obtained from computer hardware owned by Ross William Ulbricht, who the U.S. said ran Silk Road. The marketplace was an online bazaar where anonymous users allegedly bought and sold heroin, LSD, phony passports and computer hacking services. Ulbricht is contesting charges and filed a claim asserting ownership of the bitcoins. An e-mail from the U.S. Marshals, sent by accident, indicated interest from representatives of Rangeley Capital LLC, a New Canaan, Connecticut-based hedge fund, and DRW Holdings LLC, a Chicago trading firm. The companies declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to messages. SecondMarket, which specializes in hard-to-trade assets, already runs a trust for investors that lets people buy into bitcoins without the risk or technical complications of owning them directly. SecondMarket began raising money in September for the trust, which now has $62.5 million in assets and is seeking to open it to smaller investors as well. The group is assembling a syndicate to bid for the bitcoins, according to CEO Barry Silbert. \u201cOur syndicate will open up bidding to a much larger universe of smaller purchasers, foreign buyers and those bidders that don\u2019t want their identity revealed,\u201d Silbert said. The price of bitcoins skyrocketed in 2013 to $1,147 from around $12 as technologists and speculators flocked to the digital currency, before dropping sharply amid regulatory crackdowns in China, Russia and elsewhere. Its price was $562.39 today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which represents an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. Bitcoins, which exist as software and aren\u2019t controlled by any single authority or country, emerged in 2009 out of a paper authored under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, retailers selling everything from gummi bears to psychiatric services to luxury homes have started accepting bitcoins. Pantera will participate in the auction, according to CEO Dan Morehead. While he declined to discuss the fund\u2019s strategy, Morehead said in a prior interview his fund will buy bitcoins and invest in businesses that are building the infrastructure to make the digital currency more useful, and therefore more valuable. \u201cThere will be a whole spectrum of opportunities in the digital currency ecosystem,\u201d Morehead said in the interview.

That was partly because Demarchi, like most sellers, would only accept U.S. dollars as the Argentine peso weakens. It also was because the country\u2019s mortgage market, which had been growing, is shrinking with interest rates at a five-year high, forcing most buyers to pay cash in hard-to-get dollars. More than two years of restrictions on buying the U.S. currency are pushing down Argentina\u2019s home prices for the first time since 2002. A weakening peso, with this year\u2019s slide accelerating to 20 percent, is driving sellers like Demarchi to demand dollars. And with benchmark rates set at 28.9 percent to fight inflation at 37 percent, use of home loans has shriveled. \u201cThe real estate market was so hugely impacted by currency controls because it\u2019s priced in dollars and there\u2019s no mortgage lending,\u201d Jose Rozados, a director at research company Reporte Inmobiliario said in a telephone interview. \u201cWith inflation not slowing to a reasonable level anytime soon, and currency controls still in place, the situation will probably deteriorate.\u201d Home prices were 10 percent lower in dollar terms from a year earlier in May, according to Buenos Aires research company Reporte Inmobiliario. Only 4.4 percent of 24,408 property purchases in Argentina\u2019s Buenos Aires province this year through May were made with mortgages, the smallest share in data going back to 1998. Last year, 20 percent of home purchases were made with mortgages, up from 17 percent a year earlier. Homes bought with bank loans haven\u2019t surpassed 21 percent of the total in the past 14 years. Argentina\u2019s three-month central bank note, the country\u2019s benchmark lending rate, rose to 28.9 percent this year, the highest in the world, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Benchmark rates of similar maturities in Brazil, Mexico and the U.S. are 10.7 percent, 2.9 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively. Government efforts to jumpstart the creation of an effective mortgage market have also been unsuccessful. It has been offering subsidized rates of 2 to 14 percent to finance new houses built on state lots. Still, the government doesn\u2019t have enough funds to offer loans to the broader population, and the 79,333 mortgages awarded since the start of the project in June 2012, hasn\u2019t been enough to revive the housing market. Home prices are falling even as Argentines flock to assets perceived as safer than a peso-denominated bank account -- appliances, cars, even bitcoins, a commodity promoted as a digital, or virtual, currency that isn\u2019t subject to government control. Last year saw the biggest surge in demand in five years for foreign autos such as Porsche 911 Carrera S sports cars, sparking the government to clamp down on the purchases to stem an outflow of dollars. Homebuyers are demanding more value for their dollars as the biggest economic contraction since 2008 and soaring inflation increase demand for hard currency. The government\u2019s court battle with holdout bondholders denounced as \u201cvultures\u201d is threatening to lead to Argentina\u2019s second default since 2001. In illegal street markets used to skirt currency controls, the Argentine peso has slipped to 12.5 per dollar, the weakest in six months. That\u2019s 53 percent worse than the rate in the official market, which is controlled by the central bank. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who in July 2012 banned most dollar purchases outright after tightening controls in October 2011, this year authorized Argentines to buy foreign currency worth 20 percent of their average monthly salaries, with a limit of $2,000 per month. Dollars are still tight and many sellers can\u2019t wait until currency controls ease further to get out, according to Florencia Cecchini, a real estate broker at Re/max Holdings Inc. in Buenos Aires. \u201cPrices had refused to budge for a while, even as sales fell, but now owners are seeing they have no choice,\u201d Cecchini said in an interview. Prices will fall as much as 30 percent in the next three years before rebounding, Cecchini said, citing Re/max estimates. The average price per square meter of a two-bedroom apartment in Buenos Aires fell 10 percent to $1,693 in May, from $1,887 a year earlier, according to Reporte Inmobiliario. By comparison, prices rose 26 percent in dollar terms in Sao Paulo and 8.2 percent in Santiago. At current mortgage rates, borrowers would have to pay about 7,000 pesos per month on a loan to buy a $100,000 apartment, said Roberto Arevalo, director at Argentina\u2019s Real Estate Chamber. The average monthly salary in Argentina is about 8,400 pesos ($1,028 at the official dollar rate). \u201cThere\u2019s a widening gap between the dollar price for properties and salaries in pesos,\u201d Arevalo said. \u201cIf you add that to virtually no mortgage lending, it means the dream of owning a home remains just that for most people, a dream.\u201d Mortgages represented 9 percent of Argentine banks\u2019 total lending in June, according to the country\u2019s central bank. Demarchi, the home seller, bought the house in 1989, at a time when prices were lower in dollar terms as a result of hyperinflation of 1,300 percent in Argentina.

A federal agent who said he made more than 50 drug buys from Silk Road and went undercover as a site administrator, walked jurors through the process of anonymously trading money for bitcoins and then using the digital currency to buy drugs with a few clicks of a computer mouse. Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a Department of Homeland Security special agent, told jurors in Ulbricht\u2019s conspiracy and drug-trafficking trial in Manhattan today that Silk Road had 13,810 listings of drugs for sale around the time it was shut down. He said its product categories included cannabis, dissociatives, Ecstasy, opioids, psychedelics, prescription drugs and stimulants. Buyers could click on a listing for \u201c1 gram of Blue Magic Black Tar Heroin (85% pure)\u201d or \u201c0,5 Gr Uncut Crack Cocaine!!\u201d add the purchase to a virtual shopping cart, pay with bitcoins, then wait for the drugs in the mail. Prosecutors said about 95 percent of Silk Road\u2019s business came from drug sales. Ulbricht is also charged in connection with the site\u2019s sale of fake identification documents and computer hacking assistance. He got his online identity \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d from a character in the film \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d according to prosecutors. Prosecutors claim Ulbricht also tried to arrange the murders of at least six people who threatened his multimillion-dollar business. The government doesn\u2019t believe any murders were carried out. Ulbricht is charged separately in federal court in Baltimore for one of those alleged murder-for-hire plots. Ulbricht, who pleaded not guilty, faces as long as life in prison if convicted of the trial\u2019s most serious charge, Internet drug trafficking. In his opening statement yesterday, Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer said his client started Silk Road in 2011 as an \u201ceconomic experiment\u201d and left after a few months. He said Ulbricht was set up as a \u201cfall guy\u201d for the site\u2019s operators. Der-Yeghiayan said he began the Silk Road investigation as part of his work tracking drug shipments through Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport. He told the jury of six men and six women about an online undercover buy of 1,000 Ecstasy tablets using Silk Road. On April 5, 2013, agents wired $7,000 to the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox Co. in exchange for 27.27 bitcoins. Silk Road required that all transactions be made in bitcoins to keep the buyers\u2019 and sellers\u2019 identities secret, Der-Yeghiayan testified. Mt. Gox, formerly the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection last year after losing $473 million in bitcoins. The agents, using the name \u201cdripsofacid,\u201d then ordered 1,000 200-milligram tablets of Ecstasy on the Silk Road site from a vendor named \u201cSuperTrips\u201d that offered free shipping, worldwide, from Germany. They transferred the money, the equivalent of the $5,499.99 sale price, to Silk Road and had the drugs sent to a Chicago post-office box under a fake name. Der-Yeghiayan said Silk Road held bitcoin payments in escrow until the buyer received the order and completed the transaction. He said the site had customer-assistance employees who helped moderate disputes between buyers and sellers. Once a transaction was complete, the sellers could go to a bitcoin exchange and trade the virtual currency, anonymously, for gold, dollars or another currency, the agent said. Der-Yeghiayan said the price of bitcoins ranged during the investigation from about $2 to $250. Der-Yeghiayan said he was an undercover Silk Road site administrator for several months, working 10 to 12 hours a day on an Apple MacBook in exchange for about $1,000 a week in bitcoins. He said he had frequent online chats, using the name \u201ccirrus,\u201d with Dread Pirate Roberts and other Silk Road employees, including two who used the names \u201clibertas\u201d and \u201csamesamebutdifferent.\u201d Silk Road was operated on the Tor network, which routes communications through a series of computers to allow users to be anonymous. The agent told jurors that Ulbricht was online as Dread Pirate Roberts on his laptop in San Francisco\u2019s Glen Park Library on Oct. 1, 2013, corresponding with Der-Yeghiayan as cirrus, who was in a nearby caf\xe9. Der-Yeghiayan signaled other agents who arrested Ulbricht, taking care to seize his computer before he could log out, he said. Der-Yeghiayan is expected to conclude his testimony tomorrow.

He was an Eagle Scout who earned an advanced degree in physics from Penn State University before abandoning academia to pursue a career in finance. Ross Ulbricht, 29, who was arrested Oct. 1 in San Francisco and imprisoned in Oakland, California, yesterday appeared in federal court in Manhattan. U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis ordered Ulbricht, who is charged with narcotics trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking, to remain in custody. Federal prosecutors in Maryland have charged him with attempted murder. Ulbricht denies the charges and will seek bail at a hearing set for Nov. 21, his lawyer, Joshua Dratel, said yesterday. Ulbricht founded Silk Road, a \u201csprawling, black-market bazaar,\u201d in early 2011 that he ran under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts, prosecutors allege. \u201cHe\u2019s not the person they\u2019re saying he is,\u201d Dratel said outside the courtroom after Ulbricht\u2019s brief appearance. He is \u201ca regular person, a loyal friend,\u201d Dratel said. Friends and family \u201cexpress their firm conviction that he\u2019s not the person\u201d prosecutors claim, Dratel said. The Justice Department\u2019s 33-page court filing outlines the operation of the online marketplace for illegal drugs and details the evidence pointing to Ulbricht as Dread Pirate Roberts, or DPR, after a character in the 1987 film \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d The portrait of Ulbricht that emerges from the recollections of his friends, professors and classmates, as well as the social media footprint he left behind, shows the Austin, Texas, native to be something of a Renaissance man. Ulbricht was a popular student who indulged his craving for alcohol and controlled substances without becoming dependent, a gifted artist who posted his phantasmagoric sketches on his Facebook page, and an outdoorsman who enjoyed hiking and snowboarding and who was daring enough to leap off a 50-foot cliff into a lake, according to a video he posted online. He was an Eagle Scout, said Charles Mead, director of public relations at the Boy Scouts of America. After graduating from high school in Austin, he attended the University of Texas at Dallas. \u201cHe was a smart guy,\u201d said Sean Gaulager, 29, a classmate from Westlake High School\u2019s class of 2002 who operates a nonprofit art gallery in East Austin.\xa0Ulbricht \u201chad a knack for computers,\u201d\xa0Gaulager recalled. In a 35-minute podcast recorded last December with a friend, Rene Pinnell, that appeared on YouTube but has since been taken down, Ulbricht said he led an active party life during high school, experimenting with alcohol and drugs. Gaulager said he didn\u2019t think Ulbricht\u2019s behavior was unusual. \u201cI think that it\u2019s fairly common in this day and age for kids to experiment in high school and after high school,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was overt or over the top or anything like that.\u201d Even in a high school that produced two current National Football League quarterbacks, Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints and Nick Foles of the Philadelphia Eagles, Ulbricht seemed destined for big things. \u201cHe was average in the sense that he was like a normal guy,\u201d Gaulager said. \u201cBut he was above average in terms of intelligence, you know, in terms of drive. You could tell he was going to do something big.\u201d At the University of Texas at Dallas, Ulbricht majored in physics. He also began a flirtation with Eastern philosophy, according to the podcast. He had an intense, two-and-a-half year relationship with a girlfriend that caused some of his friends to think he would marry, Pinnell said in the podcast. But marriage wasn\u2019t for Ulbricht, who said in the podcast that he broke off the relationship. He was admitted to a selective graduate program in physics at Penn State run by Professor Darrell Schlom. During his three years there, Ulbricht developed a new persona. His interest in Eastern philosophy and the spiritual concept of \u201coneness\u201d was supplanted by a commitment to libertarian ideas and an incipient interest in politics. Ulbricht was a supporter of Texas congressman Ron Paul\u2019s 2008 bid for the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination, telling Penn State\u2019s paper, the Daily Collegian, that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot to learn from him and his message of what it means to be a U.S. citizen and what it means to be a free individual.\u201d Ulbricht wore a Ron Paul for President T-shirt to class regularly, recalled one of his professors who asked not to be identified. The physics student also immersed himself in the principles of Ludwig von Mises, an Austrian economic thinker with a following in libertarian circles. Ulbricht joined a student group, the Austrian Economic Society at Penn State, according to a former Penn State student who was friendly with Ulbricht at the time and asked not to be identified. Ulbricht was serious about Austrian economic theory. He went on road trips organized through the society to Auburn, Alabama, the headquarters of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, according to the fellow student. Ulbricht put his theories into action. During an era of easy credit that helped inflate the housing bubble, he invested in gold and other currencies, reaping significant gains, according to the fellow student. Ulbricht also bought a three-bedroom, two-bath house just off campus, for $174,675, in 2007, putting down a deposit of 10 percent, according to county records. To help pay the bills, Ulbricht rented out rooms in the house. Two former tenants, Greg Wieserman and Josh Wyka, who live in State College, said they recalled nothing unusual about Ulbricht as a landlord. \u201cHe was very reachable, and was very cool,\u201d said Wieserman, who added that he was surprised when he learned about the charges against Ulbricht. \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d was willing to use deadly force when his own economic interests were threatened, according to prosecutors in New York and Maryland. On two occasions, according to court filings, DPR paid online \u201cconfederates\u201d to murder individuals who threatened his business. On one of these occasions, the \u201cconfederate\u201d was an undercover agent who received $80,000 to execute a former Silk Road employee and sent staged photographs to convince DPR that the murder had been committed, prosecutors said. The other occasion involved a payment by DPR to an individual who called himself \u201credandwhite\u201d and promised to execute a blackmailer, \u201cFriendlyChemist,\u201d for $150,000, prosecutors said. There is no evidence that any such murder took place, even though DPR paid the money, the FBI said. As for his research work, Ulbricht excelled, according to two of his professors in the school of Materials, Science and Engineering. He wrote or collaborated on several published research papers in the area of \u201cspintronics,\u201d which, according to Penn State\u2019s website, involves the orientation of polarized electrons, an area of study affecting the development of semiconductor chips. Ulbricht completed his work for his Master\u2019s degree in 2009, according to Penn State. Instead of advancing further in the field by studying for his PhD, he wanted to pursue a career in finance, according to his two professors. Asked by his primary adviser, Darrell Schlom, to fill in his occupation upon the completion of his studies, Ulbricht wrote that he worked at \u201cRetracement Capital,\u201d according to a roster of graduates on Schlom\u2019s website. \u201cHe was a nice and bright colleague and I did regret his choice to leave science,\u201d Andreas Schmehl, who collaborated with Ulbricht as a post-doctoral student at Penn State, said in an e-mail. \u201cI\u2019m aware about the recent events and they were as shocking to me as to anyone who worked in the group during that time.\u201d Schmehl, who is in the physics department at the University of Augsburg in Germany, said in a subsequent e-mail that \u201cI knew he was going to pursue a career in the financial business. He was openly talking about this. I don\u2019t know his deeper motivations for this move and we never discussed them. But I know quite a bunch of people who started doing science and then turned their analytical talents towards other fields. So it wasn\u2019t that unusual or surprising. We lost contact after he left the group.\u201d Ulbricht aired his libertarian views on a posting attributed to him on Amazon.com, where his master\u2019s thesis is offered for sale. \u201cThis manuscript is the culmination of my career as a scientist,\u201d Ulbricht wrote. \u201cIt marks the fulfillment of my goal to expand the boundaries of human understanding of nature. The rest of my life is dedicated to bringing freedom from oppression to the people of the world.\u201d In January 2011 he started Silk Road, an online marketplace where buyers and sellers of illegal drugs could come together and transact using Bitcoin, a digital currency that provided its users with anonymity, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Silk Road\u2019s operations remained hidden from the prying eyes of the law on the onion router, or TOR network, which disguises the origins of digital communications. Over the next two and a half years, the FBI said, the site did $1.2 billion worth of business, netting Ulbricht more than $79.8 million in commissions, according to prosecutors. Following an extensive two-year cyber-manhunt, the FBI tracked down Ulbricht in San Francisco, where he had moved in 2012 ostensibly to join his friend Pinnell in a startup. From the podcast the men made last December, it appears that Pinnell believed Ulbricht\u2019s occupation at the time of the move was his investment in foreign currencies. According to a profile he submitted to Instadate, an online dating website, after moving to San Francisco, Ulbricht claimed to be a Christian single libertarian with an annual income greater than $1 million. Ulbricht has supporters for the idea of an online marketplace for controlled substances. \u201cI think he\u2019s a genius,\u201d said Joshua Braun, 36, of Santa Barbara, California, who said he drove over 300 miles to attend Ulbricht\u2019s court appearance in San Francisco last month. Silk Road is an \u201cingenious creation\u201d that\u2019s making the world a safer place for recreational drug users, Braun said. \u201cI happen to know people very high up in their fields\u201d who used Silk Road \u201cto maintain their responsible drug use,\u201d Braun said. Silk Road provided a safe and efficient way for people to purchase drugs, said Braun, a former medical marijuana dispensary operator who said he was charged with 73 counts of money laundering when local prosecutors started cracking down on medical pot. The dispensary was shut down and he served three months house arrest; now he runs a hydroponics business. \u201cPeople are getting shot\u201d trying to buy drugs on the street, Braun said. \u201cI think overall you are not going to stop drugs,\u201d he said.

Spending Bitcoins to purchase goods may trigger capital gains and losses or ordinary income and losses, which have different tax rates, Olson said in her annual report to Congress. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s responsibility to inform the public about the rules they are required to follow,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe lack of clear answers to basic questions such as when and how taxpayers should report gains and losses on digital currency transactions probably encourages tax avoidance.\u201d Olson, who runs an independent office within the IRS, listed digital currency as one of the 25 most serious issues encountered by taxpayers. Atop Olson\u2019s list was the absence of a clear set of taxpayer rights and the decline in IRS service and enforcement stemming from budget cuts, issues on which she has repeatedly urged change. Olson has a new audience this year in John Koskinen, who was sworn in as IRS commissioner Dec. 23. \u201cWhat taxpayers need and deserve is the transformation of the IRS from a traditional enforcement-focused tax agency to a forward-looking modern agency that embraces technology even as it recognizes the specific needs of taxpayers for personal assistance,\u201d she wrote. Introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the most prominent of a group of virtual currencies -- money that exists mainly as a string of code -- that have no central issuing authority. \u201cMiners\u201d unlock new Bitcoins by using ever-faster computers to solve complex mathematical problems, and transactions are recorded anonymously in a public ledger. Today, even with its young age and regulatory uncertainties, Bitcoin can be used to pay for T-shirts, food or an appointment with a Manhattan psychiatrist. The IRS hasn\u2019t offered guidance on Bitcoin, beyond saying that it is working on the issue and that it has been monitoring digital currencies and transactions since 2007. The IRS today reiterated a statement it issued in December. \u201cThe IRS is aware of the potential tax compliance risks posed by virtual currencies,\u201d it said in the statement. \u201cThe IRS continues to study virtual currencies and intends to provide some guidance on the tax consequences of virtual currency transactions.\u201d According to Olson\u2019s report, a big distinction for the IRS to make is whether Bitcoin is property, in which case capital gains rules would apply with a top basic rate of 20 percent. If it\u2019s treated like a \u201cnonfunctional currency,\u201d ordinary income tax rates would apply with a top rate of 39.6 percent. The IRS can\u2019t outlaw Bitcoin, said Joshua Blank, a tax law professor at New York University. It can use past experience to require information reporting about transactions. Tax compliance rates are highest when there is third-party reporting, particularly with wage data that employers send to the IRS. Compliance rates are lowest with no such reporting, as with self-employment income. \u201cThe danger is the creation of an electronic black market, similar to the cash economy,\u201d Blank said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the IRS wants to avoid.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-09/clear-bitcoin-tax-rules-needed-taxpayer-advocate-says', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 9, 17, 13, 7, 843000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Clear Bitcoin Tax Rules Needed, Taxpayer Advocate Says'}, {'articleText': u'  A former Anonymous hacker who faced 26 years in prison for staging global cyber-attacks, was set free by a judge who credited him with helping prevent at least 300 such intrusions, including one on the U.S. Senate website. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan federal court today cited Hector Xavier Monsegur\u2019s \u201cextraordinary assistance\u201d in secretly working with the U.S. government, sentencing him to the seven months he\u2019d already spent in custody. She credited him for immediately agreeing to cooperate when confronted about his hacking by federal agents. \u201cThat personal characteristic of turning on a dime and doing good instead of evil is the important factor in this sentence,\u201d Preska said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done as much as any human being can do in terms of helping the government to make up for past wrongs and to avert other damage to probably millions of people.\u201d Monsegur, 30, who used the online name Sabu, belonged to the hacker groups Internet Feds and LulzSec, an offshoot of Anonymous. LulzSec attacked computer networks at Nintendo Co. and stole confidential data on more than 70,000 potential contestants on Fox Television\u2019s \u201cX-Factor,\u201d according to prosecutors. The group also attacked the computer networks of Sony Corp., the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, the Arizona State Police, and technology-security company HBGary Inc., U.S. said. After agreeing to cooperate with the government, Monsegur worked \u201caround the clock,\u201d talking to hackers around the globe, including LulzSec which had vowed to destroy evidence and disband if any members were arrested, the judge said. Monsegur also helped prevent a cyber-attack on a foreign energy company and another on the water supply in a major U.S. city, Preska said. Today in court, Monsegur, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and grey slacks, apologized for the harm he\u2019d caused and said he had learned many lessons since he pleaded guilty to 12 crimes in August 2011. \u201cI assure you I will not be back in this courtroom,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the same person you saw three years ago. I\u2019m ready to move on.\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney James Pastore asked Preska not to impose a mandatory two-year prison term, citing Monsegur\u2019s help. While federal sentencing guidelines, which are advisory, called for 21 1/2 years to more than 26 years in prison, court officials recommended probation. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to quantify Mr. Monsegur\u2019s cooperation,\u201d said Pastore, adding that the defendant helped identify \u201cback doors\u201d or weaknesses in computer systems in corporations and foreign governments. \u201cHe was able to unmask and thwart outright or minimize hundreds of attacks,\u201d he said. During the time of his secret cooperation, Monsegur worked from his apartment, staying up all night talking online to his fellow hackers and then meeting with authorities passing on what he learned. Evidence Monsegur helped develop led to the prosecution of at least five hackers, including Jeremy Hammond, who was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison by Preska for an attack on the intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting Inc., or Stratfor, and for interfering with eight other computer systems. Anonymous called Monsegur a traitor in a posting on Twitter today, following the sentencing. \u201cJeremy Hammond is serving a ten-year sentence for hacks that Sabu (working for the feds) told him to do,\u201d the group said in a posting. Philip Weinstein, Monsegur\u2019s lawyer, said after today\u2019s sentencing that the hacker is still helping the government with other cases. Monsegur has been unemployed while awaiting sentence, Weinstein said. \u201cHe\u2019s taught the government things that they don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. Before Monsegur\u2019s cooperation, he was the only member of a crew of hackers behind a series of cyber-attacks who had been identified by authorities, the U.S. said. LulzSec had developed a plan to destroy evidence and disband if the group determined that any of its members had been arrested, according to prosecutors. Hackers affiliated with Monsegur had attacked the websites of the governments of Algeria, Yemen and Zimbabwe, the U.S. previously said. Monsegur\u2019s family had to be relocated by the FBI when his identity as a government informant was made public, his lawyer Peggy Cross-Goldenberg told Preska today. He was also threatened by some who incorrectly speculated that he assisted in the investigation and prosecution of Silk Road, the billion-dollar online website where customers used bitcoins to buy and sell drugs, according to the U.S. The case is U.S. v.

Illinois Town Bond Sales Halted Over Fraud Charge on Hotel Deals A city outside Chicago was blocked from selling bonds after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused it of defrauding investors and steering secret fees to a municipal official. The case against Harvey, Illinois, a 25,000-person city in Cook County, concerns about $14 million in bonds sold from 2008 to 2010 that were to finance the construction of a Holiday Inn. Another such sale was considered as soon as this week. The SEC on June 24 said that the city hoodwinked investors by using $1.7 million to pay payroll and other operating expenses, while the hotel stands in disrepair with holes in its facade, exposed studs and a gutted interior. The SEC said Comptroller Joseph Letke, 55, profited by receiving $269,000 in undisclosed payments from the deals. \u201cHarvey\u2019s bond investors were misled into believing their money would go toward construction of a Holiday Inn when instead the bulk of it was diverted into Harvey\u2019s general coffers and Letke\u2019s pocket,\u201d David Glockner, the director of the SEC\u2019s Chicago office, said in a statement. The agency has been moving more aggressively to crack down on public officials who mislead investors in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market. It previously brought fraud cases against Illinois and New Jersey, and this month it settled with a Chicago charter-school operator for failing to disclose insider business dealings that led the state to withhold grants. Letke didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages left at his offices seeking comment about the sanction. A spokesman for the city said Mayor Eric Kellogg has no comment on the agency\u2019s allegations. U.K. Starts Energy Market Probe That May Split \u2018Big Six\u2019 U.K. competition authorities will conduct a full investigation of the energy market to determine whether the six biggest utilities are unfairly profiting from their market power. The industry regulator Ofgem asked for the probe, whose final recommendations are due at the end of next year. The report may recommend splitting power-generation businesses from units that supply consumers and businesses. The decision reflects concern that natural gas and power customers are being shortchanged by the companies, whose profits have more than quadrupled since 2009. With the next election less than a year away, energy has become a touchstone part of Britain\u2019s political agenda, with all parties criticizing suppliers for being quick to raise prices when wholesale costs rise and slow to cut them. \u201cThis will help rebuild consumer trust and confidence in the energy market as well as provide the certainty investors have called for,\u201d Ofgem Chief Executive Officer Dermot Nolan said in an e-mailed statement. The regulator asked the Competition and Markets Authority for an investigation. It said there\u2019s increasing consumer distrust of suppliers and uncertainty about the relationship between the generation arms and supply businesses of the Big Six, which consist of Centrica Plc, SSE Plc, Electricite de France SA, RWE AG, Iberdrola SA and EON SE. All of the Big Six welcomed the inquiry. Keith Anderson, chief corporate officer of Iberdrola\u2019s ScottishPower unit, said it \u201cprovides a real opportunity to clear the air.\u201d For more, click here. Bitcoin to Get Scrutiny From Consumer Bureau After Prodding Bitcoin and other digital currencies will get more attention from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after prodding from a congressional watchdog. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, wrote in a confidential report last month that the bureau, created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, needed to become more active in developing U.S. digital-currency policies. In a written response, the agency agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to increasing our involvement in formal working groups as they engage on specific issues relating to consumer protection,\u201d William Wade-Gery, CFPB\u2019s acting assistant director for card and payment markets, wrote in a May 6 letter to the GAO. While the GAO report didn\u2019t specify the issues that should be addressed by the CFPB, fraud and security have been serious problems for some bitcoin users. For example, an exchange based in Tokyo went bankrupt in February after losing most of its users\u2019 accounts to hackers. Bitcoins emerged in 2009 out of a paper authored under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, retailers selling items from Gummi Bears to luxury homes have started accepting bitcoins, and new companies have begun offering ways to ease its use as a payment system. Argentina Bond Fight Judge Rejects Stay of Debt Payment Ruling A federal judge sided with Argentina holdout bondholders who urged him not to delay enforcing his order that the country pay them at the same time it makes payments on restructured debt. U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan yesterday denied the stay sought by the South American nation. The creditors, led by NML Capital, said they\u2019re willing to enter into talks with Argentina and would consider working out \u201ca consensual accommodation\u201d to allow Argentina to make its bond payment by July 30, the end of its 30-day grace period, if talks \u201chave made good progress,\u201d according to a letter filed with the court. Martin Marietta Purchase of Texas Industries Cleared by U.S. Martin Marietta Materials Inc.\u2019s $2.7 billion purchase of Texas Industries Inc. was approved by the U.S. Justice Department under a settlement that requires asset sales. Martin Marietta will sell rail yards in Texas and an Oklahoma quarry to maintain competition in the market for gravel, sand and crushed stone, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division said in court filings yesterday in Washington. \u201cWithout the divestiture obtained by the antitrust division, customers would have likely faced higher prices as a result of this acquisition,\u201d Bill Baer, the division\u2019s head, said in a statement. Martin Marietta, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, gains entry into the cement market with the Texas Industries purchase as construction bounces back. U.S. housing starts topped 1 million on an annual basis in April and May after plummeting as low as 478,000 in April 2009. Martin Marietta\u2019s products, known as aggregates, are mixed with cement to produce concrete. Texas Industries, based in Dallas, is the largest cement producer in Texas, with two cement plants there, and the third-biggest in California.

You may have heard about this trial. Later this week we expect to see Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke on the witness stand. We could scarcely improve upon the coverage that Andrew Zajac and his colleagues on the legal team are providing, but that\u2019s not why you come to Opening Line anyway.  It\u2019s got all the makings of a show trial, as the New Yorker magazine pointed out last week in its irreverent approach. \u201cMost news organizations are covering the trial straight, as if it were a deadly serious affair,\u201d John Cassidy writes in the magazine. \u201cIt is, in fact, an absurdist comedy, rich in ironies, worthy of the Marx Brothers or Mel Brooks. Rather than dispatching its legal correspondents to write about it, newspapers would do better to send their comic-strip artists, or, if they can find one in this age of solemnity, an old-fashioned wiseacre in the mold of the late Art Buchwald or Mike Royko.\u201d While we\u2019d never entertain any comparison to those two late icons of journalism, we\u2019re happy to oblige nonetheless. Dispensing with the facts of the case, which seem to be that the U.S. government took shares in AIG when it shouldn\u2019t have, we\u2019ll skip right to oddities that arise when Personages of Great Importance are hauled before a court. Luckily, Boris Feldman, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati of Palo Alto, California, wrote a primer for lawyers who represent CEOs. Its primary focus is in the deposition process, and Paulson, Geithner and Bernanke weren\u2019t CEOs exactly, and the U.S. government isn\u2019t a company per se. But let\u2019s use it for our purposes, and we commend it to Justice Department lawyers Joshua Gardner and Kenneth Dintzer. - First, there is this general observation: \u201cCEOs are usually smart.\u201d - That said, don\u2019t let down your guard: \u201cIt is important that you hear what the CEO knows before you start feeding him facts. [Y]ou should resist the natural (for litigators) tendency to tell him everything about the case until you have considered, item by item, whether a fact is something he needs to know or is better off not knowing.\u201d In other words, don\u2019t push the boundaries of their intelligence. They might get confused. - \u201cIn a high-profile case, the CEO\u2019s performance at trial will have a major impact on public perceptions of the company,\u201d Feldman writes. And he makes a good point, because the public\u2019s perception of this company, U.S.A. Inc., could use a boost. - \u201cAbsent unusual circumstances, you should not make many objections during his cross (examination). You risk irritating the judge and possibly the jury. Don\u2019t create the impression that the CEO needs your help to survive cross. Let him do it on his own.\u201d We\u2019re not sure about the antecedent in this sentence. Is Feldman saying the CEO should be left to create the impression that he needs the lawyer\u2019s help to get through cross-examination? We looked through the history books, all of them, as they\u2019re now handily compiled in Wikipedia, to search for any precedent of a Treasury secretary, current or former, being hauled before a judge to explain his actions in the office. All we could find were entries on Andrew Mellon and John Connally, but those both involved personal peccadillos. We found nothing out there on a Fed chairman being put under oath. But we did find a couple precedents that might work, and Feldman got to them, too. First, there\u2019s Bill Gates in Microsoft\u2019s antitrust case. Feldman\u2019s lesson here is don\u2019t play stupid. \u201cGates\u2019s professed inability to understand what a \u2018browser\u2019 was did not endear him to the trial judge.\u201d Then there\u2019s Bill Clinton, whose object lesson could reasonably be inferred as don\u2019t BE stupid.

In this instance, the claims involved are those made by nonprofits that BP contends received hundreds of thousands of dollars while having suffered no losses.

Millennials, for those not near a chart, are the generation born from about 1981 to 2000 or 2001, following Generation X, which makes them anywhere from 15 years old to 33 years old. (Please don\u2019t write to us quibbling about the years. It\u2019s inexact, we know.) So, right off the bat we\u2019re going to suggest the onset of delayed marriage in the 15-year-old set is probably a good thing. But that\u2019s just being flippant. It\u2019s the 24-29 bracket that\u2019s putting on the brakes, and it\u2019s causing some ripples in the economy. Almost half have never married, up from about a quarter in the mid-1980s, Matthews writes. The average ages in a first marriage were 29 for men and a little less than 27 for women in 2013. They were more than six years younger in 1959, when there was little threat to existence like we find with today\u2019s economy, which is taking the brunt of the blame in Matthews\u2019s report. Married people tend to set up house, which means trips to Williams-Sonoma and Home Depot. They often have kids, which means trips to the pharmacy and the bank, and then the liquor store. To make sure the Cleaver households are represented, University of Minnesota professor Steven Ruggles finds, in a study still to be published, that declining wages for young men make them less desirable for women who prefer the traditional values for deciding whom to marry and/or are too feminine to go get some silly old job. Whatever the observable reasons are for why marriage may be declining, we\u2019re struck that the people in the story sound so surprised by this. Have they never been married? *** The NFL begins testing players for human growth hormones today, because it\u2019s natural to implement this kind of policy in Week 5, right?

The NFL needs a source to reveal the enacting of its own policy? Anyway, the players shouldn\u2019t be too concerned, because anyone of them who tests positive for HGH has a right to challenge the science \u201cbehind the HGH isoforms test\u201d in his appeal. And we all know how ruthless professional football players can get when given the chance to poke holes in the science of HGH isoforms. Whatever. Let\u2019s get to the money. We tried to find Las Vegas odds on positive tests for HGH this season, or an over/under, but all we could find easily was a post from vegas-sportsbetting.com from 2011, back when HGH testing was first supposed to go into effect. There\u2019s no reason to believe the methodology would change that dramatically, so here are the odds, three years too old and probably inaccurate, taking into account comments from former Indianapolis Colts receiver Anthony Gonzalez that as many as 20 percent of players use HGH. - Odds that any player tests positive: -200 - Odds that no player will: +150 - Odds that an offensive lineman will test positive: 3-to-1 - Defensive lineman: 5-to-2 - Punter/kicker: 10-to-1 - That a punter/kicker is an alcoholic: Actually, that\u2019s not on there. And now, our over/under on the number of players who test positive from Weeks 6 through 17 this year: eight. No science behind it. Just a hunch. *** Well that was easy.

The bank had the data removed promptly and notified law enforcement about the theft of information for as many as 350,000 wealth-management clients, the New York-based company said yesterday. The Dec. 27 Pastebin posting asked for 78,000 speedcoins in return for information on Morgan Stanley clients, according to the person, who asked not to be named because probes are under way.

The information that was stolen didn\u2019t include passwords or Social Security numbers, Morgan Stanley said yesterday in a statement. The bank found the employee may have been seeking to sell the stolen information, though there was no evidence any third party received it, the person briefed on the matter said.

It\u2019s also the strongest sign yet that a four-year lobbying campaign by the largest asset managers to avoid heightened federal scrutiny is succeeding. Staffers from agencies that make up the council, including the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., have been working on the request for comment, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. The solicitation may be published in the Federal Register in the next few months, they said. Financial firms designated by the council are put under Fed supervision and can be subjected to stricter capital, leverage and liquidity requirements. After initially considering BlackRock and Fidelity for greater oversight in October 2013, the FSOC, under pressure from the industry and Congress, slowed its deliberations on individual asset managers. A Treasury spokeswoman, Suzanne Elio, referred to minutes of the council\u2019s Oct. 6 meeting, when it discussed potential areas of focus and risks. She declined to elaborate. SEC Opens Trading Inquiry of Apple Sapphire Supplier GT Advanced GT Advanced Technologies Inc., the Apple Inc. supplier seeking bankruptcy protection, is now facing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry on trading in its shares as the company approached bankruptcy. The SEC inquiry, disclosed in a filing yesterday, may reveal what GT Advanced executives knew as they sold shares and struggled to fulfill a contract with Apple to deliver scratch-resistant sapphire glass for iPhones. The company is cooperating with the request for information, according to the filing. When Apple introduced new iPhones in September, the smartphones didn\u2019t include the sapphire, and GT Advanced filed for Chapter 11 reorganization last month. The company had evolved into a supplier for the iPhone maker with a deal to provide sapphire glass in exchange for early payments in four installments. Apple didn\u2019t pay the final check due in April, GT Advanced disclosed in court records, as the supplier sought to fulfill \u201ccertain operational targets.\u201d During those months, GT Advanced Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gutierrez, Chief Operating Officer Daniel Squiller and other insiders sold more than $18 million of shares in the company, according to data from Elink.com Inc. Jeff Nestel-Patt, a spokesman for Merrimack, New Hampshire-based GT Advanced, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Judith Burns, a spokeswoman for the SEC, declined to comment about the inquiry. Bitcoin Firm Head Charged in First U.S. Securities Case Trendon Shavers, founder of Bitcoin Savings and Trust, was charged with fraud and accused of masterminding a $4.5 million Ponzi scheme, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan who said it was the first U.S. securities-fraud prosecution tied to the electronic currency. Shavers, 32, who operated the firm that made virtual currency-based investments through the Internet, raised at least 764,000 bitcoins through his business, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. At the peak of the scheme, Shavers possessed about 7 percent of all the bitcoins in public circulation, Bharara said. Shavers allegedly offered investors who lent bitcoins to Bitcoin Savings as much as 7 percent interest weekly -- an annualized interest rate of 3,641 percent per year -- and investors were told they could withdraw their investments at any time, according to the U.S. Investors were also told their investment would be used to support a market-arbitrage strategy, according to the U.S. Shavers in truth \u201clargely failed\u201d to execute the claimed market arbitrage strategy and failed to deliver the agreed upon rates of interest, according to prosecutors. He used bitcoins from new investors to make purported interest payments to existing investors, Bharara said. In September, in a separate action brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in Texas, Shavers and Bitcoin Savings were fined $40.6 million and he was barred from further illegal trading of the virtual currency. The cases are U.S. v. Shavers, 14-mj-00355, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan), and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Shavers, 13-cv-00416, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Sherman).

Ross William Ulbricht, accused of operating the marketplace where customers used bitcoins for anonymity, was also charged with Internet drug trafficking in a revised indictment yesterday in Manhattan federal court. Silk Road was shut down by federal authorities last year. \u201cUlbricht reaped commissions worth tens of millions of dollars generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site,\u201d prosecutors said in the indictment. Ulbricht also attempted to pay for the murder of \u201cseveral individuals he believed posed a threat to that enterprise,\u201d the U.S. said. Ulbricht, an Eagle Scout who earned an advanced degree in physics from Penn State University before abandoning academia to pursue a career in finance, was first charged in 2013 with running an illicit online market and is scheduled for trial Nov. 3. Other charges include conspiracy to commit computer hacking and money laundering. The new charges \u201cdemonstrate the government\u2019s penchant for converting a single alleged course of conduct into a set of multiple similar, interchangeable charges in an effort to improve its chances of having a jury, overwhelmed by the sheer number of charges, agree with the government on at least one,\u201d Ulbricht\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Dratel, said in an e-mail. Ulbricht pleaded not guilty in February and has denied the allegations. Anonymous Silk Road customers, including thousands of drug dealers, used bitcoin digital currency to buy heroin, LSD, phony passports and computer-hacking services, the U.S. said. The site was shut down by federal authorities in October and its alleged mastermind arrested. Ulbricht, who the U.S. said ran Silk Road starting in January 2011, was known as \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d or \u201cDPR,\u201d after a character in the 1987 film \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d Prosecutors said he operated \u201cthe most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet.\u201d Ulbricht was also indicted in federal court in Maryland for allegedly trying to arrange the murder of an employee. He also denied those allegations. Three alleged former employees, Andrew Michael Jones, Gary Davis and Peter Phillip Nash, were charged in a federal indictment unsealed in New York in December. Federal agents seized about 174,000 bitcoins, valued at the time at more than $33.6 million, in connection with the Silk Road case. Ulbricht was arrested about the same time in San Francisco. Bitcoins currently trade at about $525 per coin, according to Bloomberg data. \u201cThe site has sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the Internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites,\u201d the government said in court filings after his arrest. Charlie Shrem, the former Bitcoin Foundation Inc. vice chairman, in April pleaded not guilty to charges that he tried to launder more than $1 million in the virtual currency in a case tied to Silk Road. Last month, venture capitalist Tim Draper was the single winning bidder for a cache of 29,656 bitcoins at a U.S. government auction of the currency seized during the Silk Road investigation.

The fund, which began in February, had attracted about 25 clients, who contributed from $25,000 to $10 million each to invest in the virtual currency, Stapper said in an interview. While many more called to inquire about bitcoin, they didn\u2019t invest, in part because bitcoin\u2019s price slipped more than 50 percent this year, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Falcon refunded the money to its clients in November, and has decided to refocus on consulting about bitcoin and how it works, Stapper said.

The price of admission: $83.75. Squeezed into a tiny private room at a Chinese restaurant not far from Tokyo\u2019s capitol hill, Mineyuki Fukuda was at the head of the table with a half-dozen techies. Fukuda started by explaining how he, a second-term lawmaker on an obscure subcommittee overseeing electronic payment systems, wound up in charge of Japan\u2019s bitcoin policy. Nine months ago, no more than a handful of Japanese officials had even heard of the digital currency, let alone something called Mt. Gox, a bitcoin bank run by a Frenchman who just happened to live in Tokyo. After $473 million worth of virtual money was stolen by hackers, the government was finally forced to ask: What is bitcoin? And, more importantly, who should regulate it? \u201cThe finance ministry didn\u2019t want to deal with it. Neither did the trade ministry,\u201d said the 50-year-old politician, a skinny pink necktie and an unruly shock of dark hair accenting his gray suit. \u201cIt fell to me.\u201d To get the facts, Fukuda went on a listening tour. He met with traders, programmers and merchants to find out how bitcoin works, and how it doesn\u2019t. A popular blog showed him posing next to a computer rig with its circuit boards exposed, and smiling with an entrepreneur who looked more like a skateboarder than a businessman. Rather than making a law, Fukuda decided instead to push industry to come up with its own rules and enforce them. Cultivating new business is part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s agenda, so Fukuda was able to persuade colleagues in the Liberal Democratic Party to risk his hands-off approach. For the average Japanese person, bitcoin began and ended with the Mt. Gox meltdown. It\u2019s viewed as an imported oddity that\u2019s now dead. These days, the vast majority of enthusiasts at weekly meet-ups in Tokyo are expats. Fukuda says he wants that to change. Still, it\u2019s sometimes lonely being the only government authority in charge of a technology few understand. During a fact-finding mission to the U.S. in September, Fukuda says he was stood up by Colorado congressman Jared Polis, who canceled their meeting at the last minute. When Fukuda tries to tell voters back home in Yokohama about his new portfolio, he says the response is usually: \u201chuh?\u201d On this chilly November evening, though, Fukuda was sharing oolong tea, aged Chinese wine and sweet and sour pork with fellow biterati, a group of seven supporters and two journalists crammed around the table. It was a rare audience who could actually appreciate Fukuda\u2019s musings about the potential uses of blockchain, the permanent online registry that prevents bitcoin from being counterfeited. \u201cTo me, Bitcoin isn\u2019t just a form of money,\u201d Fukuda told the room. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is the future of blockchain.\u201d \u201cIndeed, indeed,\u201d came the response from around the table. \u201cTake, for example, the process of registering property titles,\u201d Fukuda continued. \u201cRight now the government has to keep records. If blockchain were used, everyone would know who owns what and the government wouldn\u2019t have to be involved.\u201d One of the diners kept trying to steer the conversation into the realm of central bank conspiracy theories, a favorite topic among bitcoin\u2019s early adopters. They had each contributed a minimum of 10,000 yen, or about $84, to fund Fukuda\u2019s trip to the U.S., where he met with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and some bitcoin entrepreneurs. Fukuda\u2019s party didn\u2019t cover his expenses because he\u2019d already used up his travel budget. The main message the lawmaker brought home: \u201cEveryone said they wished the U.S. was doing it the Japanese way.\u201d When it comes to regulating bitcoin, standards are all over the map. The U.K has kept quiet on the subject, leaving entrepreneurs to wonder what will happen, while the U.S. and China have been quick to make rulings to limit speculation or stop money laundering. Then there\u2019s Japan, where Fukuda made some clever compromises. His first move was to define bitcoin using purposely nebulous language that floats clear of Japan\u2019s banking laws. Most countries have decided that bitcoin is either a currency or a commodity. Fukuda\u2019s formulation -- \u201cdigital recorded value\u201d -- isn\u2019t either of those. Next, he teamed up with one of the people seated around the table that evening, a 38-year-old former trader at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. who quit a year ago to start his own bitcoin exchange, a replacement for Mt. Gox. Fukuda persuaded Yuzo Kano to set up a trade group called the Japan Authority of Digital Asset. The idea is get bitcoin businesses to adopt some basic standards, like making sure that money is stored off-line in a \u201ccold wallet\u201d so that hackers can\u2019t get at it, or requiring account holders to identify themselves in selfies with their driver\u2019s licenses in the shot. Since JADA started in August, five companies have signed up. One heated back-and-forth during the dinner showed how hard it may be to get people in line. \u201cI don\u2019t think our clients want to provide photos,\u201d said David Zhang, an entrepreneur in his early 20s who founded his own trading platform. \u201cLook,\u201d Kano responded, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to accept some rules if we want to avoid real government regulation.\u201d Like the permissive parent who lets the kids rough house at the slumber party, Fukuda sat back and watched. Finally, he stepped in to make it clear that, although it may look voluntary, JADA has the force of Japan\u2019s government behind it. \u201cWe made this happen,\u201d he said. Fukuda wrapped up the dinner by reminding his guests that before he can do more to advocate bitcoin, he has to win a snap general election called for Dec. 14. Wanting to do his part, one of the donors whipped out his smartphone to make a campaign contribution in bitcoin right there on the spot. In theory, it would have taken just a few seconds to scan a QR code and wire the funds. Japan\u2019s chief government authority on the digital currency grew flustered as he fumbled with his handset. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have my bitcoin account on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s on my other phone.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-03/meet-the-man-who-s-making-japan-an-oasis-for-bitcoin-startups', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 12, 3, 15, 0, 1, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Meet the Man Making Japan an Oasis for Bitcoin Startups'}, {'articleText': u'  Mom, who turns 80 this year, allowed on the drive back to her place last weekend that she might be open to having a smartphone.

So, we\u2019ll probably need to get some bonds in there. If anyone reading this knows anything about bonds, give a call. But hey, you don\u2019t go into journalism for the golden parachute, right? No, for that you need to work in retail, evidently. Because as a complement to the income gap or the wealth gap, or whatever, comes the \u2018\u2018retirement gap,\u201d as Carol Hymowitz and Margaret Collins report. When once Pop-Pop got a full pension and a gold watch (figuratively) from the Insurance Co. of North America, the hoi polloi now are likely to be rewarded after a lifetime of labor with their own threadbare retirement savings and a job at Arby\u2019s. Hymowitz and Collins run through the especially golden attributes to former Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel\u2019s parachute, which they find is about $47 million wide. They crunched a few numbers and learned it\u2019s 1,044 times the average balance in a Target employee\u2019s 401(k) savings. So, yeah. Arby\u2019s. Free fries with that, right? *** The holidays are over, and after the (happy?) ordeal of the past couple weeks, with January staring us in the face, a lot of you are in dread mode. You\u2019re back to work -- like, real work -- and your reward for getting through January is its meaner brother, February. Aside from the day pitchers and catchers report to spring training for the 2015 baseball season, there\u2019s really nothing to look forward to until Good Friday on April 3, followed by Easter. By then you should have thawed out a little. But there is that saving grace in just a couple weeks, Martin Luther King Day, that sweet Monday, there on the calendar (Jan. 19) to save your sanity. The better among us will answer the bell for the national day of service, but for those with more recreational aspirations, the casinos have your number(s). Here in Philly, Parx Casino is going big with two events for us to pause and reflect on the meaning of the civil-rights leader\u2019s birthday: the \u201c25K MLK Sweepstakes,\u201d whatever that entails, on Jan. 17, followed by the \u201cMLK Grab for Cash\u201d on Jan. 18. This appears to involve standing in a transparent box while attempting to snatch swirling money from the air. In Mahnomen, Minnesota, the Shooting Star Casino is touting \u201cGolden Eagle Bingo\u201d to mark the occasion, with the promise of a free dauber, tape or glue for your bingo card. And just to observe the solemnity of the day, you can see on its website that the \u201cO\u201d in bingo is an \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d lapel pin. Stop by the DiamondJacks Casino & Hotel in Bossier City, Louisiana, for the MLK Holiday Slot Tournament, or the Riverwind Casino in Norman, Oklahoma, for \u201cA MLK Celebration Featuring Eric Ben\xe9t.\u201d (Tickets are $79 for platinum/VIP seating, $69 for premium, and $59 for mezzanine level.) But if you\u2019re going to do it right -- if you\u2019re going to find the true meaning of the life of a man who just wanted black people to be able to live the same life white people lived and was murdered for it -- head to Las Vegas itself, where the Silverton Casino Hotel is holding its \u201cDay of Opportunity\u201d on Jan. 15, \u201ca free event with the purpose of celebrating the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., by opening the doors to opportunity for everyone.\u201d *** They were packed in by the thousands, standing room only, last Saturday night in Boston. It was understandable: The headliners were some really big names in the industry. We heard there were groupies, but we were unable to confirm Nouriel Roubini\u2019s attendance, so maybe not. No, Bono wasn\u2019t attempting to play the guitar, nor was Taylor Swift debuting the latest song about a man who jilted her. This was the American Economic Association\u2019s annual meeting, and the audience was rapt by the strains of \u201csecular stagnation.\u201d It was a tune played by Larry Summers and Robert Gordon from the National Bureau of Economic Research. These economists and their lyrics. Here\u2019s how it goes, according to Rich Miller\u2019s account, and if it sounds like it was written by a singer named Cassandra, we feel you: Things are not looking good, at least not as good as you\u2019d like. Sure, the car we\u2019re driving, the U.S. economy, is firing on all cylinders (pretty much), but this road is littered with potholes, and there could be a couple real axle-breakers out there. Greg Mankiw, the former White House chief economist, and Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School, were there to offer some more optimistic views. Guess the point of Miller\u2019s story is to keep your eye on the road. *** Everyone who had the 7-8-1 Carolina Panthers advancing in the NFC playoffs against the 11-5 Arizona Cardinals, raise your hand. [Looking around.] OK, fine. We didn\u2019t. Fact is, the results of the NFL playoffs over the weekend had some surprises, including the 78 total yards of offense Arizona produced or the 10 points Cincinnati was only able to muster in its loss to Indianapolis. Ben Roethlisberger came up short -- or the Ravens came up tall -- in Pittsburgh\u2019s 30-17 loss to Baltimore, and Detroit broke its city\u2019s heart again after snatching defeat from the jaws of victory against Dallas, helped by some questionable refereeing. But Chris Christie\u2019s happy. Had your breakfast yet? Erik Matuszewski has the round-up here. Not as surprising were the outcomes of the inaugural U.S. college football semifinals. Oregon was clearly toying with Florida State in the Rose Bowl before scraping the Seminoles off their cleats, and we had picked Ohio State beating Alabama from a mile away, though not predicting the shootout that ensued. The national championship game a week from tonight looks, on paper at least, like it\u2019s going to live up to the hype. Oregon is favored by 7 points in some Las Vegas books, and that seems both logical and wrong. *** The first time we ever uttered the words \u201cboo-yah\u201d was in what had become a \u201chipster\u201d bar called \u201cThe Ministry of Information\u201d in the Northern Liberties section of Philadelphia, and we were immediately chastised for it by the bar\u2019s new owner, dripping as he was in tattoos and absurd facial hair. The dive had been \u201cthe W&J,\u201d so named for Walter and Juliette, the old Polish couple who had owned the place forever and ever, and even though this hole in the wall still retained the appearance of having been stopped in time somewhere in the 1940s -- there were still polkas on the jukebox -- it was evident now that times were changing. The Pabst Blue Ribbon 12-ounce cans were still there, but now they were \u201cironic.\u201d \u201cCultural fascism,\u201d or something to that effect, was what my drinking companion muttered moments later, and we slipped out past the rest of the tattoos, who were noshing on edamame and soy noodles, a few minutes later. We didn\u2019t really know where the term \u201cboo-yah\u201d had come from when we said it, or why we said it at that moment, just that it was part of some popular idiom. Following the death yesterday of ESPN anchor Stuart Scott, the man who popularized the saying -- and some other choice catch-phrases -- to punctuate dramatic moments in a game\u2019s events, it\u2019s become ironic that the lingo of a man who renovated the sound of sports reporting, who brought change to the old ways, would be denigrated by someone else representing change. Or who thought he did. When a new voice comes along, a presence in a space we all share, some take to it more quickly than others. But when it really is genuine and fresh and, above all, excellent, we all come around eventually, and there comes a time when you can\u2019t imagine what that space sounded like without it.', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-05/true-terror-is-mom-being-proficient-in-instagram-opening-line', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 5, 11, 0, 53, 284000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'True Terror Is Mom Being Proficient in Instagram: Opening Line'}, {'articleText': u'      Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- A San Diego researcher is turning to\ncrowdfunding to help him create a patent-free drug to treat\nmelanoma and kidney and breast cancers, the Times of San Diego\nreported.

A few feet away, an engineer tests a virtual reality headset that can allow a coffee-shop owner to forecast hot-chocolate sales during a blizzard. This is Visa Inc.\u2019s new outpost in San Francisco -- part executive office, part design laboratory and entirely the brainchild of Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s chief executive officer. Scharf, who this July day had unveiled the latest version of the company\u2019s digital wallet, is sitting in an office overlooking San Francisco Bay one floor above the lab. He\u2019s wearing jeans, loafers and a gray shirt with no tie. One leg is propped up on his desk. Moving into the heart of the city, 23 miles (37 kilometers) from Visa\u2019s suburban headquarters in Foster City, California, and three blocks from a Google Inc. office, is a statement about how Scharf is seeking to embrace the new technologies transforming the way consumers make payments, Bloomberg Markets will report in its November issue. \u201cWe have to think and act much more like a technology company than we have before,\u201d Scharf says a few weeks later at a restaurant in Sag Harbor, New York, where he\u2019s on vacation with his family. \u201cThe payments world is changing. There are new entrants, new opportunities for people to get into our business and other opportunities for us to grow our business in ways that didn\u2019t exist before.\u201d Visa runs the world\u2019s largest payments network, and Scharf, 49, the quiet, methodical former protege of JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, is fighting to ensure that the 56-year-old company stays relevant and ubiquitous as more transactions are made online or by mobile phone and other digital devices. Visa and its smaller competitor MasterCard Inc. control 87 percent of global credit- and debit-card transactions and profit from fees banks pay them to process those payments. Once associations owned by the biggest U.S. banks and now independent companies, they act as middlemen between lenders that issue credit, merchants that accept electronic payments and consumers who use cards to make purchases. Although the model has been profitable, some investors say it also can be inflexible and outdated, making the networks vulnerable to disruption. \u201cVisa and MasterCard are holding on for dear life,\u201d says Josh Siegel, CEO of StoneCastle Partners LLC in New York, which invests in financial firms. Scharf \u201chas to figure out how to take this cash cow -- which does have massive market power -- and either stifle or acquire technology to maintain the status quo or become that renegade and totally overhaul the company.\u201d The disruptions Scharf faces include virtual currencies such as bitcoin, alternative online-payments systems like PayPal that can bypass credit cards and new methods for enabling mobile-phone transactions. He\u2019s also battling competing networks, fending off lawsuits over swipe fees with retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and contending with rules in China and Russia that restrict what foreign firms can do. In Scharf\u2019s two years at the company, his strategy has focused on opening Visa\u2019s network to new technologies. That has included collaborating with the likes of Apple Inc. and Google; giving developers and startups such as Square Inc., which helps small businesses accept cards, access to Visa\u2019s systems; and investing in firms like LoopPay Inc., whose software allows customers to store credit-card data on their phones. That strategy paid off in September, when Apple announced it was turning its new iPhone into a mobile wallet that makes in-store payments possible with the tap of a finger. Instead of developing Apple Pay on its own, the company partnered with Visa, MasterCard and American Express Co., piggybacking its technology onto already existing payments systems. The phone uses wireless near-field communication to deliver a digital identifier called a token, which helps prevent hacking by eliminating the need for merchants to have access to account numbers. Companies including McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Target Corp. have agreed to accept Apple Pay. The systems required to process bank-card payments and the security needed to protect consumer data are potent weapons for defending Visa\u2019s business model. The company\u2019s primary command center, at a location in the Washington area that Visa asked Bloomberg Markets not to identify, is guarded by a moat, features floors that are 4 feet (1.2 meters) thick and has enough food and water to supply 120 employees for 45 days in an emergency. There are four backup sources of water to cool machines the size of cars whose data are duplicated at another center. Computers track more than 70 billion transactions a year, displayed on 40-foot-wide screens. \u201cFor another company looking to break into the payments business, it\u2019s nearly impossible for them to replicate the systems that Visa has in place,\u201d says David Ellison, who oversees more than $5.5 billion, including Visa shares, at Hennessy Advisors Inc. in Boston. \u201cKeeping their network secure is key to sustaining their high multiples and sustaining the economy. They are probably one of the most important financial companies outside of the Fed.\u201d Although Scharf won\u2019t provide specific forecasts, he says the technology and security investments he\u2019s making will translate into revenue increases in the next 2 1/2 years. And his efforts to collaborate with retailers and startups will contribute to earnings growth during the next four, he says. Visa\u2019s profit margins show how resilient the network has been to disruption as consumers replace checks and cash with electronic payments. Net income in the first six months increased 19 percent from the same period a year earlier, and the average operating margin was 64 percent. That compares with MasterCard\u2019s 12 percent gain in profit and 59 percent operating margin. While Visa\u2019s margins have helped its shares gain 377 percent since the company\u2019s 2008 initial public offering, compared with a 36 percent increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the stock has slipped 5.7 percent this year, making it one of the worst performers in the index. Investors pulled back after the company cut its global revenue growth forecast for the 12 months ended in September to between 9 percent and 10 percent, the smallest increase since 2009, citing geopolitical risks and a strengthening U.S. dollar. In the fiscal year that ended in September 2013, Scharf\u2019s first as CEO, for which he was awarded a $10.5 million pay package, net operating revenue increased 13 percent. Scharf, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in social and behavioral sciences from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a Master of Business Administration from New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, has built a career on corporate turnarounds. In 1987, his father, then a stockbroker, helped get his resume in front of Dimon, who hired Scharf as an assistant at Commercial Credit Corp., a consumer finance firm where Dimon was chief financial officer and Sanford \u201cSandy\u201d Weill was CEO. Dimon, who says he likes that Scharf \u201cisn\u2019t a bulls-- tter,\u201d recalls how he\u2019d send him to failing companies to run the numbers, relying on his intellect and attention to detail. \u201cHe would always be pointing out things we could be doing differently,\u201d says Dimon, whose bank is the biggest U.S. issuer of Visa credit cards. Scharf remained loyal to Dimon for 25 years, following him to Citigroup Inc. to help build what would become the largest U.S. bank and then to Bank One Corp. in Chicago, a regional lender later acquired by JPMorgan. There, he rose to chief of the retail bank and helped arrange the takeover of the biggest failed U.S. lender, Washington Mutual Inc., during the 2008 financial crisis. Since joining Visa in November 2012, Scharf has been shaking up the company\u2019s culture. For years, Visa had focused on the interests of its clients, the biggest banks, viewing new technologies as threats to its model and fighting with retailers over swipe fees. \u201cIt was deeply embedded in the culture that we would only talk to the traditional players,\u201d Scharf says over a croque-monsieur at Sag Harbor\u2019s American Hotel. \u201cWhen I got to the company, I learned there are a number of merchants out there that don\u2019t just not like us; they hate us.\u201d Those tensions have fueled lawsuits, most recently in March, when Wal-Mart sued Visa for $5 billion for allegedly conspiring with banks to fix transaction fees, a case Visa says it\u2019s working to resolve. Target and Wal-Mart are among retailers developing their own payments networks designed to give them more control of processing costs. Visa and MasterCard also are adjusting to new regulations, such as the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which cut the average debit-card swipe fee by almost half to about 24 cents. Scharf, who had been a Visa board member, was tapped by directors in 2012 to replace retiring CEO Joseph Saunders. He began by overhauling management, hiring Ryan McInerney, who had worked with him at JPMorgan, as president, and Ramon Martin from AmEx to lead Visa\u2019s first team dedicated to merchant services. He modified roles for others, putting then\u2013Chief Legal Officer Ellen Richey in charge of risk and Jim McCarthy, head of innovation, in a role working with technology companies and startups. Scharf fired outside consultants and retooled struggling projects such as V.me, a system designed to make online purchases easier that hadn\u2019t caught on with merchants. In November 2013, Scharf invited two Visa antagonists to a leadership meeting in Half Moon Bay, California: Michael Cook, assistant treasurer at Wal-Mart, and John Donahoe, CEO of EBay Inc., whose PayPal unit is one of Visa\u2019s biggest competitors and clients. In front of more than 100 Visa employees, Cook talked about how the network\u2019s rules made Visa frustrating to work with, and Donahoe described how PayPal\u2019s creative culture allowed employees to recognize opportunities to make online payments easier. \u201cEveryone is a frenemy in the payments world,\u201d says Donahoe, who recalls how during his first dinner with Scharf, at a restaurant above a grocery store in San Mateo, California, he was stunned when Scharf suggested their firms meet quarterly. \u201cHe understands that of course technology is going to change our payments over time, but he wants to embrace that and innovate around that, rather than protect the past.\u201d Donahoe said Sept. 30 that EBay plans to spin off PayPal as a separate public company. The deal could make PayPal a tougher competitor to Visa while boosting payments volume on Visa\u2019s network, according to analysts including Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.\u2019s Sanjay Sakhrani. \u201cIn more cases than not, PayPal is enabling transactions on the networks, so it really benefits the networks if PayPal has a more focused strategy,\u201d Sakhrani says. Scharf\u2019s management style is understated. He used to unwind by building furniture in a woodshed in his Scarsdale, New York, backyard before moving to an apartment and now relaxes by practicing acoustic and electric guitar. \u201cHe is more reserved; he\u2019s not so much an extrovert,\u201d says Gordon Smith, CEO of JPMorgan\u2019s consumer bank, whose office was next to Scharf\u2019s for about six years. \u201cBecause he\u2019s quieter, it takes a while to get to know him.\u201d Now, Scharf is applying his methodical approach to addressing the challenges Visa faces outside the U.S. In China, Shanghai-based payments processor China UnionPay Co., founded by the State Council and central bank, dominates in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. UnionPay had the highest percentage increase in purchase transactions among global networks last year, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter that tracks network data. Earlier this year, as tensions between Russia and the U.S. intensified, Visa and MasterCard stopped processing payments at some banks after the U.S. imposed sanctions, prompting laws restricting foreign networks. MasterCard CEO Ajay Banga, who worked in a different business at Citigroup than Scharf in the late 1990s, faces similar challenges. Still, some investors say the smaller firm is better positioned in overseas markets. The majority of non-U.S. transactions are made with cash, presenting an opportunity for the card companies to benefit from the shift to electronic payments. Volume is growing faster on MasterCard\u2019s network than on Visa\u2019s in Asia and Latin America. In Europe, Scharf can\u2019t compete with Purchase, New York\u2013based MasterCard because a separate company owned by banks handles Visa\u2019s European transactions. \u201cIf you want to invest in a global business, you can\u2019t do that with Visa because they don\u2019t have Europe,\u201d says Tom Russo, whose Lancaster, Pennsylvania\u2013based Gardner Russo & Gardner manages more than $9 billion in assets, including shares of Visa and MasterCard. \u201cThere\u2019s a belief that MasterCard is potentially better suited for the great global growth.\u201d Geopolitics explains why one of the fastest-growing divisions at Visa is government relations. Scharf has hired lobbyists in Washington and country managers in places such as Canada and Russia as lawmakers consider changing swipe-fee rules, look for ways to make transactions safer and try to generate more tax revenue. Visa also has partnered with governments in Rwanda and China to help citizens who don\u2019t have access to traditional banks. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately about supporting the financial institutions,\u201d says William Sheedy, Visa\u2019s head of corporate strategy, mergers and acquisitions and government relations. \u201cIf you can keep the flow of commerce in banks, then the regulatory monitoring systems that governments have, locally and globally, will work really well.\u201d Heightened awareness about privacy has spurred Visa to move forward with advances Scharf says are critical for growth and data security. U.S. retailers and banks have squabbled for years over costs, slowing adoption of some security technologies. Data breaches like the ones at Home Depot Inc. and Target have increased pressure to implement more-secure systems, including chip cards with so-called EMV technology, named for developers Euro-Pay International, MasterCard and Visa. \u201cWe need to be as relevant, if not more relevant, in the digital world as we have been in the physical world,\u201d says McInerney, Visa\u2019s 39-year-old president. \u201cWe are going to have to partner with the types of players in the payments industry that we haven\u2019t historically.\u201d Visa\u2019s San Francisco outpost is the embodiment of that new attitude. Scharf, who helped find the One Market Plaza location and design the two-story space, was inspired to build the office after meeting with Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter Inc. and payments company Square, whose offices are nearby. On the July day when Scharf introduced a new version of Visa\u2019s digital wallet, employees were still moving in and dusty scaffolding lined the walls of what was once the headquarters of the Southern Pacific Railroad. \u201cThe world is changing around us dramatically,\u201d Scharf says. \u201cWe have to evolve and change.

The Cabinet Office in Tokyo said that the economy shrank less than initially estimated in Q2, dropping an annualized 1.2 percent, but this wasn't enough to lift stocks that seemed to take their lead from weaker Chinese trade data. Eurostat, the European Union statistics office, said that the euro-area economy expanded 0.4 percent in the second quarter, higher than its initial estimate of 0.3 percent growth. Growth in the first quarter was also revised higher. European equities are higher today, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index up 1.9 percent at 10:40 a.m. London time.\xa0 Spanish house-prices jumped 4.2 percent in the second quarter, the biggest rise since Spain's National Statistics Institute started publishing prices in 2007. With a general election due to be held in December, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will welcome the improving data in a country still suffering the effects of the 2008 property crash. Yesterday Glencore Plc, the Swiss producer and trader of raw materials announced a $10 billion debt reduction plan which included moth-balling copper projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia which, the company says, will remove 400,000 metric tons of copper cathode from the market.

The address: block 368396. That\u2019s the new digital home for the equity stake his firm made in Symbiont, a startup using bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain software to make it quicker and easier to prove ownership of assets or transfer them between buyers and sellers. Putting its money where its mouth is, Symbiont on Tuesday morning digitized and published several of its equity investments to the blockchain, which drives the bitcoin digital currency. That means the stakes will forever be part of that public record, allowing dividend payments or stock-option conversions to happen automatically. \u201cI woke up this morning and thought, \u2018This is a historic moment,\u2019\u201d Brownhill, a managing partner at New York-based SenaHill, said in an interview after the Symbiont presentation on Tuesday. The merchant bank has investments in over a dozen other private companies. \u201cOur job now is to go and espouse the benefits to all our portfolio companies,\u201d he said. Wall Street is becoming enamored with the potentially transformational way blockchain could overhaul how derivatives, bonds, loans and other asset classes work, dramatically simplifying the process of tracking ownership and accelerating the transfer of assets from one person to another. Symbiont\u2019s innovation is creating what it calls smart securities. The company is now practicing what it preaches: its founders\u2019 stakes as well as shares and options granted to employees have been converted into encrypted code that lives in the bitcoin blockchain -- the same ledger where any purchases and sales of the digital currency are recorded. Symbiont customers can do likewise to track changes in ownership interests. \u201cToday is the day crypto joins Wall Street,\u201d Symbiont Chief Executive Officer Mark Smith said to the room full of investors, bankers and reporters in New York. Representatives of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions were among the audience members. Symbiont\u2019s not alone in trying to bring the blockchain to Wall Street. Other firms investigating finance-related uses of blockchain include Digital Asset Holdings LLC, headed by former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker Blythe Masters; Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.; Ripple Labs; and the New York Stock Exchange. In June, Symbiont raised $1.25 million from a group of investors including former NYSE chief Duncan Niederauer; former Citadel LLC executive Matt Andresen; two co-founders of high-frequency trading firm Getco LLC, Dan Tierney and Stephen Schuler; and SenaHill. Niederauer said digitizing private equity transactions would bring transparency to the process of issuing shares and tracking who owns what. His old rival Nasdaq agrees, and hopes to use blockchain to help shareholders of privately held companies track their stakes beginning in the fourth quarter. \u201cHaving the issuance and cap tables done the way we saw this morning will be very useful to investors,\u201d Niederauer said in an interview. He said any concern about bitcoin -- which has been linked to drug dealers and other shady transactions -- is misguided when thinking about how blockchain can be used for finance. \u201cPeople\u2019s first reaction to bitcoin is it sounds a bit edgy and dangerous,\u201d he said. But the applications that can be developed for the blockchain are where the real interest is, he added. \u201cThat was my main interest in investing in the company.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-04/wall-street-meet-block-368396-the-possible-future-of-finance', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 8, 4, 17, 33, 36, 829000, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Wall Street, Meet Block 368396, the Future of Finance'}, {'articleText': u"  Snapchat Inc. is seeking a new round of funding that would value the company as high as $19 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said, making it the third-most valuable venture-backed company in the world. Snapchat, which makes a mobile application for sending photos and videos that disappear within seconds, wants to raise as much as $500 million, said the person, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Executives are in advanced discussions with fund managers, the person said. The Los Angeles-based company would be valued at $16 billion to $19 billion in the financing round, the person said. At that level, Snapchat would be ranked behind only mobile car-booking application Uber Technologies Inc. and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. in the top three startups backed by venture capital firms, according to data compiled by researcher CB Insights. Xiaomi is valued at $45 billion, while Uber\u2019s latest round pegged its value at $40 billion. That value is also close to the $22 billion Facebook Inc. paid last year for WhatsApp Inc., a messaging company that now has 700 million users. Snapchat\u2019s valuation has skyrocketed since it was born in 2011 out of a Stanford University fraternity house. Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel, 24, turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013 and went on to raise funds from 23 investors at a $10 billion valuation last year. That increase has corresponded with a surge in venture spending to the highest level in more than a decade. Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Snapchat, declined to comment. Venture capitalists pumped $48.3 billion into U.S. companies last year, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the most since 2000. Venture financings of more than $500 million hit a six-year high last year, CB Insights said. Snapchat lets people take and draw on photos, then send them to select friends or add them to a public \u201cstory.\u201d The photos and videos disappear seconds after the recipient views them. The company says its users -- the app is popular among teens -- send more than 700 million disappearing \u201csnaps\u201d and view more than 500 million stories daily. Last year, Snapchat started showing short-form advertisements that are optional to click on and disappear after they are viewed, like its other content. The company has promised not to use any demographic information to target information to individuals. That differs from the business models of social-media competitors Facebook and Twitter Inc., which pitch their ability to serve advertisers based on their users\u2019 interests and activities. Snapchat also has been developing new features to make it more of a destination for entertainment, a strategy that could help it lure more viewers and sell more ads. In January, Snapchat started Discover, a kind of short-form television, betting that its users will like having their news and entertainment curated, as opposed to reading it in a feed as they do on Facebook or Twitter. The service lets users browse content from 11 different channels, including CNN, ESPN, Comedy Central, Cosmopolitan, Vice and Yahoo News. The company\u2019s fast-growing and young audience has already drawn some studios to create exclusive content for the application. Snapchat is getting its own superhero series, where stars from YouTube and Vine are featured in short clips. Vice Media Inc. first released a report that it filmed inside a Chinese bitcoin mine on Snapchat, where it was viewable for 24 hours before disappearing and moving to other platforms. Snapchat disclosed late last year that it raised $485.6 million from 23 investors, including Yahoo! Inc. and venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.

Two years after a critical report into the BOE\u2019s forecasting record, Kapadia is leading a new unit analyzing everything from monetary policy and financial regulation to climate change and digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Part of the change is to regain lost ground now the recession is over. \u201cDuring the financial crisis, more resources got devoted to dealing with the pressing issues around distress in the banking system, stress in the macro economy,\u201d Kapadia said in an interview in London. \u201cTo some extent, there was less scope or capacity to take forward research initiatives.\u201d Carney\u2019s reshaping of the research function, which included appointing a new chief economist with an expanded mandate, is just one part of a remodeling of the institution since he took over in 2013 that\u2019s touched everything from monetary policy to the staff sports day. It can also be seen as a response to the 2012 Stockton Review, which said the BOE should encourage staff to be \u201cmore assertive\u201d and challenge the \u201chouse view.\u201d \u201cThe research has to be relevant to the BOE,\u201d Kapadia said. \u201cThere is that constraint. But in terms of how we conduct research, and the responses that we make to those questions, there is freedom.\u201d Kapadia was speaking on the eve of a BOE conference on Wednesday that\u2019s part of the bank\u2019s drive to improve research and its standing among peers such as the Federal Reserve. He said staff should be \u201cquestioning and challenging orthodoxies.\u201d \u201cThe BOE ranks fairly well but we want to increase the profile of our research and the impact that it has in the international debate,\u201d he said. The BOE put the economist in charge of the newly created Research Hub last year, as well as recruiting ex-Barclays Plc strategist Paul Robinson to head up a new Advanced Analytics unit. Both teams work with the institution\u2019s monetary analysis, financial stability and supervision areas, remits that reflect Carney\u2019s desire to merge departments and improve coordination of the central bank\u2019s expanded responsibilities. They are separate from the Monetary Analysis area, led by Gareth Ramsay, which deals with day-to-day economic projections. \u201cIt focuses more on areas where typically less emphasis has been placed on research in the past,\u201d Kapadia said. Kapadia\u2019s unit will run a team into which bank staff are temporarily seconded to work. It will also seek contributions from external experts and he expects to be able to lure new researchers with the new thinking and the hub\u2019s close link to the policy debate. At the conference in London, Carney and his four deputies are leading discussions on the new research agenda. Key themes include the interaction of the BOE\u2019s expanded responsibilities, rethinking regulation and risk after the financial crisis, new sources of data, and the impact of longer-term issues such as climate change. \u201cEconomies are complex, dynamic and constantly evolving systems,\u201d Carney said in statement before the conference. \u201cPolicymakers need research to help understand these phenomena and to craft our responses.\u201d', 'publisher': 'Bloomberg', 'author': {'name': None, 'twitterhandle': None}, 'url': 'http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/carney-seeks-research-frontier-for-boe-in-post-crisis-world', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 25, 10, 30, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Carney\u2019s Research Chief Revamps BOE Thinking After Crisis Drain'}, {'articleText': u'  The second of two former U.S. agents charged with pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars in digital currency reached a plea agreement with prosecutors. Carl Force, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent, was charged with taking Bitcoins during the investigation of the illegal Silk Road Internet drug emporium, which led to the conviction of the site\u2019s founder Ross Ulbricht.
