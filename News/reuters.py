data = [{'articleText': u' NEW YORK Bitcoin exchange Coinbase said on Thursday it will add digital currency ether on its trading platform next Tuesday. The addition of ether comes given the surge in interest in the digital asset among major financial institutions such as Barclays [BARCR.UL] and UBS [UBSAG.UL] as well as other enterprises worldwide like IBM, which are trying to explore the Ethereum network. Ether is the digital currency for the Ethereum platform, a blockchain, or public ledger that can create decentralized applications. Ethereum, which uses ether to execute peer-to-peer contracts automatically without the need for intermediaries, was co-founded and invented by 22-year old Russian Canadian programer Vitalik Buterin. "We\'re very excited about Ethereum. There has been a ton of progress made in the last six to nine months," said Adam White, vice president of business development at Coinbase in an interview with Reuters. "We have seen hundreds of emerging decentralized apps (applications) launched on Ethereum." He added that bitcoin cannot mirror Ethereum\'s "scripting language," so both bitcoin and ether can co-exist and will not necessarily compete with each other. Coinbase also plans to change the name of its platform to GDAX (Global Digital Asset Exchange), said White. The name Coinbase, however, will be retained for its retail service such as exchanging dollars for bitcoin or ether, he added. Coinbase, widely believed to be the largest bitcoin-focused company in terms of investment, will offer ether/dollar and ether/bitcoin currency pairs on GDAX. The name change was made because the company will add more digital assets for trading on its exchange, White said. According to coinmarketcap.com, ether is trading at $14.28 late on Thursday, with a market capitalization of about $1.1 billion, the second largest behind bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of $6.9 billion. Daily volume for ether is around $48 million, while average daily volume for bitcoin is $87.2 million. At the beginning of the year, ether traded at just $1 per token and it is the fastest-rising digital currency. White said ether will be available on GDAX in most states except New York because Coinbase is still in the process of applying for a license in the state. Coinbase\'s move to add ether trading to its currency exchange platform came after New York approved the application of Gemini Trust Company, founded by investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, to trade ether on its exchange. "What\'s powerful about ethereum is that I can write self-executing contracts and I can run them on Ethereum and it\'s not on any central server or computer," said White.

Copyright \xa9 Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott, 2016. \xa0 A RATIONAL EXUBERANCE FOR THE BLOCKCHAIN The last few decades -- the Internet of Information -- has created many wonders but overall the benefits have been captured by powerful companies and governments. Prosperity is on the decline, there is growing social inequality, our privacy is being undermined and the dream of a more democratic peer-to-peer world has not been realized. What if there were an Internet of Value emerging? Enter the blockchain -- a vast, global distributed ledger or database running on millions of devices and open to anyone, where not just information but anything of value -- money, titles, deeds, music, art, scientific discoveries, intellectual property, and even votes -- can be moved, stored and managed securely and privately -- and where trust is established, not by powerful intermediaries like banks, governments and technology companies, but rather through mass collaboration and clever code. The blockchain is the first native digital medium for value just as the Internet was the first native digital medium for information. We are convinced that this new platform will help us reshape business and transform the old order of human affairs for the better. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ For sure, blockchain technology has profound implications for many institutions. Which helps explain all the excitement from many smart and influential people. Ben Lawsky quit his job as the superintendent of financial services for New York State to build an advisory company in this space. He told us, \u201cIn five to ten years, the financial system may be unrecognizable . . . and I want to be part of the change.\u201d Blythe Masters, formerly chief financial officer and head of Global Commodities at JP Morgan\u2019s investment bank, launched a blockchain-focused technology start-up to transform the industry. The cover of the October 2015 Bloomberg Markets featured Masters with the headline \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Blockchain.\u201d Like- wise, The Economist ran an October 2015 cover story, \u201cThe Trust Machine,\u201d which argued that \u201cthe technology behind bitcoin could change how the economy works.\u201d To The Economist, blockchain technology is \u201cthe great chain of being sure about things.\u201d Banks everywhere are scrambling top-level teams to investigate opportunities, some of these with dozens of crackerjack technologists. Bankers love the idea of secure, frictionless, and instant transactions, but some flinch at the idea of openness, decentralization, and new forms of currency. The financial services industry has already rebranded and privatized blockchain technology, referring to it as distributed ledger technology, in an attempt to reconcile the best of bitcoin -- security, speed, and cost -- with an entirely closed system that requires a bank or financial institution\u2019s permission to use. To them, blockchains are more reliable databases than what they already have, databases that enable key stakeholders -- buyers, sellers, custodians, and regulators -- to keep shared, indelible records, thereby reducing cost, mitigating settlement risk, and eliminating central points of failure. Investing in blockchain start-ups is taking off, as did investing in dot-coms in the 1990s. Venture capitalists are showing enthusiasm at a level that would make a 1990s dot-com investor blush. In 2014 and 2015 alone, more than $1 billion of venture capital flooded into the emerging blockchain ecosystem, and the rate of investment is almost doubling annually. \u201cWe\u2019re quite confident,\u201d said Marc Andreessen in an interview with The Washington Post, \u201cthat when we\u2019re sitting here in 20 years, we\u2019ll be talking about [blockchain technology] the way we talk about the Internet today.\u201d Regulators have also snapped to attention, establishing task forces to explore what kind of legislation, if any, makes sense. Authoritarian governments like Russia\u2019s have banned or severely limited the use of bitcoin, as have democratic states that should know better, like Argentina, given its history of currency crises. More thoughtful governments in the West are investing considerably in understanding how the new technology could transform not only central banking and the nature of money, but also government operations and the nature of democracy. Carolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, believes it\u2019s time for central banks everywhere to seriously study the implications of moving entire national currency systems to digital money. The Bank of England\u2019s top economist, Andrew Haldane, has proposed a national digital currency for the United Kingdom. These are heady times. To be sure, the growing throng of enthusiasts has its share of opportunists, speculators, and criminals. The first tale most people hear about digital currencies is the bankruptcy of the Mt. Gox exchange or the conviction of Ross William Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road darknet market seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for trafficking illegal drugs, child pornography, and weapons using the bitcoin blockchain as a payment system. Bitcoin\u2019s price has fluctuated drastically, and the ownership of bitcoins is still concentrated. A 2013 study showed that 937 people owned half of all bitcoin, although that is changing today. How do we get from porn and Ponzi schemes to prosperity? To begin, it\u2019s not bitcoin, the still speculative asset, that should interest you, unless you\u2019re a trader. This book is about something bigger than the asset. It\u2019s about the power and potential of the underlying technological platform. This is not to say that bitcoin or cryptocurrencies per se are unimportant, as some people have suggested as they scramble to disassociate their projects from the scandalous ventures of the past. These currencies are critical to the blockchain revolution, which is first and foremost about the peer-to-peer exchange of value, especially money. It is possible, although we believe unlikely, that this new technology may be delayed, stalled, or underutilized. But we believe that the economy works best when it works for everyone, and this new platform is an engine of inclusion. It drastically lowers the cost of transmitting such funds as remittances. It significantly lowers the barrier to having a bank account, obtaining credit, and investing. And it supports entrepreneurship and participation in global trade. It catalyzes distributed capitalism, not just a redistributed capitalism. The blockchain and cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, already have massive momentum, but we\u2019re not predicting whether or not all this will succeed, and if it does, how fast it will occur. We\u2019re arguing that it should succeed, because it holds the key to unleashing the next era of prosperity. Everyone should stop fighting it and take the right steps to get on board. Rather than predicting the future of the blockchain, we are advocating for it -- that we should harness this force not for the immediate benefit of the few but for the lasting benefit of the many. Today, both of us are excited about the potential of this next round of the Internet. We\u2019re enthusiastic about the massive wave of innovation that it is being unleashed and its potential for prosperity and a better world. This book is our case to you to become interested, understand this next wave, and take action to ensure that the promise is fulfilled. So hang on to your seat and read on! We\u2019re at one of those critical junctures in human history. \xa0 (Don Tapscott and his son Alex Tapscott are authors of BLOCKCHAIN REVOLUTION: How The Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World (May 10).

The latest bickering erupted after Australian entrepreneur\nCraig Wright promised to prove he was the mysterious creator of\nbitcoin - which allows users to move money across the world\nquickly and anonymously - but then said on Thursday he could not\nprovide further evidence to back this up. Wright stopped short of reneging on his claim to be Satoshi\nNakamoto, assumed to be a pseudonym for the person or people who\nlaunched the digital cryptocurrency in 2009. However, he\napologised for damaging the reputations of bitcoin experts who\nhad believed him. Many members of the bitcoin community reckon this is all a\ndistraction and agree with Wright when he said that the identity\nof Nakamoto "doesn\'t, and shouldn\'t, matter". "Satoshi\'s biggest achievement was to create a system that\ndoesn\'t require his participation to run," said Peter Todd, one\nof bitcoin\'s core software developers. "That\'s what makes all\nthis stuff kind of funny. It\'s like searching for the creator of\na system that\'s designed not to require a creator." While grey-suited central bankers print conventional\ncurrencies and commercial banks control transactions in them, \nno one person or entity is in charge of bitcoin. Instead it runs\non a decentralised system of shared trust without any\nthird-party verification of transactions - one reason why many\npeople are attracted to it. Critics, however, say it needs a "benevolent dictator" or at\nleast some "adults" to manage the expansion that it needs to\ncope with the increasing number of transactions. Someone, or\nsome group, must decide how to meet users\' requirements, they\nsay. Trades are handled by thousands of "mining" computers around\nthe world which validate blocks of transactions by competing to\nsolve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. The first computer to solve the puzzle clears the\ntransaction and is currently rewarded with 25 new bitcoins, now\nworth around $11,250.. This is how the computers\'\nowners cover their costs - largely power bills - and make a\nprofit. The system also ensures there is no single point in the\nsystem that might fail.  CIVIL WAR In practice, there do appear to be people who can make\ndecisions, but it is also possible to be excluded from this\nmagic circle. One of the bitcoin experts who initially believed Wright\'s\nclaim is Gavin Andresen. Nakamoto handed control of bitcoin\'s\nsoftware to Andresen when he stepped aside in 2011, a transfer\nthat kept the creator\'s identity a mystery as it was conducted\nin cyberspace without human contact. Andresen later shared that control with others. But when he\nstated publicly he believed Wright, sceptical developers\nresponded by revoking his "commit access" to a shared repository\nof bitcoin rules. Initially, these developers justified their move on security\ngrounds, saying his computer must have been hacked - something \nAndresen denied. When Reuters asked Todd whether Andresen\'s\naccess would be reinstated, he responded: "Heck no", saying a\nbelief in Wright amounted to "inexcusable incompetence". Andresen admitted to bewilderment over whether he still\nbelieved Wright\'s claims. "Ask me in six months; I don\'t trust\nmy own judgement right now after all the drama," he said on\nTwitter. The squabbling is not new. One of the lead developers, Mike\nHearn, stood down from bitcoin in January because of a power\nstruggle nicknamed the "bitcoin civil war". Hearn and Andresen had proposed increasing the size of the\nblocks in which transactions are processed but the other\ndevelopers opposed this. In quitting, Hearn said that "what was\nmeant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked\nsystemically important institutions" had now become "a system\ncompletely controlled by just a handful of people". Many investors and start-up firms remain optimistic about\nbitcoin and are making money from it. But Emin Gun Sirer, a\ncomputer science professor at Cornell University, said the\nappearance of internal conflict was undermining it. "For bitcoin to retain its value, it\'s important to have\nhope that there\'s good management in charge, that there are\nadults in charge," Sirer said. "When we see opportunistic moves,\nthat\'s a problem."  BENEVOLENT DICTATORS But Sirer also said that any open-source project such as\nbitcoin, which runs using software that anyone can access,\nchange, and distribute, faces the challenge of governance. "Is it a pipe dream to expect to be able to build a currency\nsystem that is completely decentralized and free of any control\nwhatsoever? The short answer to that is yes, but that\'s not what\nanyone should have expected anyway," he said. Sirer added that he was concerned that his brightest young\nstudents at Cornell were being deterred from getting involved\nwith bitcoin because of the in-fighting and the appearance that\ndevelopers were unable to agree on change. One other digital currency system which is attracting bright\nyoung minds is Ethereum, created in 2013 by Russian-Canadian\nVitalik Buterin when he was just 19. It works with the\n"benevolent dictator model", as Sirer calls it, with Buterin\nholding the decision-making power. "Over the last couple of years it\'s become apparent that\nhaving a static protocol is just not a viable approach," Buterin\ntold the Consensus bitcoin conference in New York earlier in the\nweek.

Although Wright did not renege on his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto - the name, assumed to be pseudonymous, of the person or group who created the web-based currency in 2008 - the U-turn was taken by many bitcoin experts as confirmation of their suspicions that the claims were false.      "I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me," Wright wrote. "But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot." Bitcoin is a web-based "cryptocurrency" that enables users to move money across the world quickly and anonymously without the need for third-party verification. Various attempts have been made to identify its elusive creator, but Wright\'s claims stood out due to the high-profile endorsements they received.  Lead bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen and bitcoin consultant Jon Matonis both wrote blogs on Monday endorsing Wright\'s claims, saying they had been shown proof by Wright that he was Nakamoto. Wright said on Thursday that Andresen and Matonis had not been deceived, but "that the world will never believe that now". "I think he\'s significantly less likely to be Satoshi than any other person that\'s been suggested," another lead bitcoin developer, Peter Todd, told Reuters, referring to others who have been suspected of being bitcoin\'s creator.   "PLAIN FISHY" After coming under pressure to provide more credible evidence that he was bitcoin\'s creator, Wright had blogged on Monday that he would provide "independently verifiable documents and evidence" that would back up his claims. The post could no longer be found on his blog site.  "The possibility that Wright is Satoshi will always exist, but given the amount of evidence calling that into doubt, I think one would be foolish to give that possibility much weight," said Jerry Brito, executive director of Washington, D.C.-based digital currency advocacy group Coin Center.  "He\'s provided no cryptographic evidence verifiable by the public, and many of his answers sound plain fishy... Today\'s statement on his blog only further tarnishes his credibility."  Wright\'s representatives declined to give any comments on his decision to back away from providing further evidence, but said he was still their client. They believed he was still in London, where he has been living for the past few months.      Interviews with some who had done business with Wright in Australia in December, when reports by Wired and Gizmodo that he could be Nakamoto first emerged, and an inspection of documents published by the two tech news websites, painted a complex picture of Wright. They pointed to a smart but sometimes abrasive figure facing growing legal and financial problems at least in part caused by his involvement with bitcoin.  Each bitcoin is currently worth around $447 BTC=ITBT , making the 15 million or so in circulation worth a total of around $7 billion. Wright said his failure to produce better evidence would cause "great damage to those that had supported" him, in particular Matonis and Andresen.  "I can only say I\'m sorry. And goodbye," Wright wrote.

Uncovering Nakamoto\'s real identity would solve a riddle\ndating back to the publication of the open source software\nbehind the cryptocurrency in 2008, before its launch a year\nlater. Bitcoin has since become the world\'s most commonly used\nvirtual currency, attracting the interest of banks, speculators,\ncriminals and regulators. Worth a total of $7 billion at current levels, it fell more\nthan 3 percent on Monday -- a normal intraday move for the\nvolatile currency -- after the news, to below $440 from around\n$455, before recovering slightly. Some online commentators suggested bitcoin\'s creator could\nhelp resolve a bitter row among the currency\'s software\ndevelopers that threatens its future. But Wright made no reference to the row in a BBC interview\nidentifying himself as Nakamoto, and as the protocol bitcoin\nruns on is open-source and cannot be controlled by any one\nperson, it is unclear whether he would be able to influence the\nway it develops.

Starting in the fourth quarter, the CME aims to begin publishing bitcoin prices about once a second during trading days and a daily settlement price based on transactions from several bitcoin spot exchanges, the company said on Monday. The owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other futures markets said the data will add "significant credibility to the nascent digital asset market." Bitcoin is a Web-based "cryptocurrency" used to move money around quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority. Despite being championed by some as the digital money of the future, it is often dismissed as a currency that is too volatile to invest in. The CME\'s pricing data "will lower uncertainty among market participants and would very likely reduce bitcoin\u2019s traditionally high volatility" by aggregating information on transactions from multiple bitcoin markets, said Paul Chao, founder and chief executive officer of Ledger X, an institutional trading and clearing platform for bitcoin options. The New York Stock Exchange, owned by the ICE, is evaluating whether to include data from a number of exchanges for a daily settlement price it has published since May 2015, said Dwijen Gandhi, head of indexes for the NYSE. Currently the settlement price is based only on transaction data from U.S. market Coinbase. The NYSE also will soon launch a real-time pricing index to "provide additional transparency and insight into the bitcoin price," Gandhi said in a statement. The CME is planning to publish its settlement price at 4 p.m. London time (1500 GMT), the same time the NYSE publishes its settlement.  The availability of more data from major exchange operators could promote the development of bitcoin derivatives contracts, said Gil Luria, a managing director for Wedbush Securities.   "The more active exchanges like CME or ICE become, the easier, the more liquid it will become for traditional investors" to trade bitcoin, he said.

That\'s because bitcoin, the digital currency, has largely\nbeen supplanted by blockchain, the technology that underlies it,\nas the main interest of investors, technology companies and\nfinancial institutions. "If there is a 100 percent opportunity in the blockchain, \nbitcoin, or the currency, is only 1 percent of it," said Jerry\nCuomo, vice president, Blockchain Technologies at International\nBusiness Machines Corp. "So there is a whole 99 percent\nthat has broad applications across the broad industries." Over the past year numerous Wall Street firms, led by\nGoldman Sachs, have declared their commitment to pursuing\nblockchain as a potential revolutionary technology for tracking\nand clearing financial transactions. The blockchain technology works by creating permanent,\npublic "ledgers" of all transactions that could potentially\nreplace complicated clearing and settlement systems with one\nsimple ledger. Still, bitcoin is by far the largest implementation of\nblockchain technology and there is considerable debate as to\nwhether one can truly develop without the other. "Bitcoin is still the only blockchain-enabled, cross-border\nlarge scale, provable application that\'s actually in\nproduction," said Joseph Guastella, a principal at Deloitte\nConsulting in New York. "Bitcoin as a currency may not be as\nrelevant as it was in many ways, but it actually is relevant as\na proof case for the blockchain technology." Bitcoins are created through a "mining" process, in which\nspecialized computers solve complex math problems in exchange\nfor bitcoins. One bitcoin is equivalent to $444.75\nlate on Monday and trade on various exchanges around the world. But bitcoin transaction volume has been in decline over the\npast six months amid a bitter split over technical changes in\nthe protocol that are needed to increase the capacity of the\nsystem that produces them. Because the cryptocurrency has no\nformal governance, it relies on a core group of developers for\ndirection - and they are sharply divided over the changes. But that debate was of relatively little concern to the\nBlockchain enthusiasts gathered in New York. Australian tech entrepreneur Craig Wright identified himself\non Monday as the creator of controversial digital currency\nbitcoin. "It\'s irrelevant because his announcement doesn\'t solve a\nproblem or resolve a conflict," said Bharat Solanki, managing\ndirector at Cambrian Consulting in New York. "It probably helps to determine the origins of bitcoin but\nonly for recognition," Solanki said. For Naoki Taniguchi, a global innovation expert at The Bank\nof Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd in San Francisco, he does not really\ncare about who created bitcoin.

The opinions expressed are his own.\xa0 It really shouldn\u2019t matter who conceived of bitcoin. There\u2019s historical curiosity, of course, and a legacy of sorts for the way in which one or more people showed vision and coding smarts to create the cryptocurrency and related technology, particularly the blockchain ledger. It\u2019s all now supposed to have a life of its own, however. If it didn\u2019t, it would defeat the purpose. Australian technology entrepreneur Craig Wright\u2019s claim to be bitcoin\u2019s creator should therefore be immaterial to its future. Some are skeptical of this latest Satoshi Nakamoto, the mastermind\u2019s nom de code. The last person to be unmasked as the inventor \u2013 one Dorian Nakamoto of California \u2013 denied the connection. Bitcoin as a currency gets its appeal because of a pre-defined and limited supply which gives it immunity from the whims of virtual monetary policymakers, unlike government-issued fiat money. And blockchain technology allows the majority of bitcoin users to decide upon the accuracy of a ledger of past transactions, a method of near-instant trade confirmation that\u2019s viewed as foolproof and tamper-proof. That is of great interest to banks and others in the financial industry. If it came out that bitcoin\u2019s creator was a crook or a government agent, for example, it might set back the credibility of the protocols and software involved, even though they\u2019re available for all to examine. That aside, though, the technology is now \u2013 as far as anyone can tell \u2013 controlled by the global bitcoin community, not by any individuals. Perfect anonymity, although associated with dealings in bitcoin, isn\u2019t actually something claimed by most of its proponents. For anyone interested in bitcoin\u2019s value, however, there is a caveat. The creator probably has a big personal stash \u2013 maybe up to 1 million bitcoins, worth about $440 million. That may explain why police raided Wright\u2019s home and office after he was named by Wired magazine in December. Whoever Nakamoto may be, any quick sale of a big sum could torpedo the price of bitcoin.

Blockchain, a vast global platform based on a distributed ledger, establishes the rules -- in the form of computations and heavy duty encryption -- that enable two or more parties to transact or do business without needing a third party to establish trust. Rather than relying on a bank, government or other intermediary to create trust, the blockchain ensures it through mass collaboration and clever code. Trust is built into the system, which is why we call blockchain the Trust Protocol. Taken one step further, the blockchain also acts as a ledger of accounts, a database, a notary, a sentry, and clearing house, all by consensus. We believe it is the second generation of the Internet and holds the potential to rewire the economic power grid and shake up the old order of things for the better. Here are the five main myths about blockchains: (Read an excerpt of our book, Blockchain Revolution, here.) 1. Blockchain good, bitcoin bad Many people, especially those in the financial services industry, are excited about the potential of blockchain technology but believe that digital currencies like bitcoin are unfeasible, undesirable or even dangerous. Whereas the bitcoin blockchain is entirely permissionless -- that is, anyone can access it via an Internet-enabled device and interact with it like they would the open Internet -- permissioned blockchains require users to have certain credentials, like a license to operate on that particular blockchain, granted by the members or some governing body. Permissioned blockchains use distributed ledger technology without having a digital currency attached. At first blush, these private and permissioned blockchains appear to have a few clear advantages. For one, members can easily change the rules if they so desire, as they only need to get their small group to agree to a change, rather than convincing a huge network of people. Costs can be kept down, as transactions only need validation from the members themselves, not a network of millions of participants. This streamlining could reduce electricity usage too, which is good for the environment. Regulators might also prefer them over public blockchains, like the bitcoin blockchain, because they need not be anonymous or pseudonymous. But not so fast. The easier it is to change the rules, the easier it is to flaunt them. Intentionally limiting certain freedoms or access can inhibit neutrality. With no open value innovation, the technology is more likely to stagnate and become vulnerable. Further blockchains tied to a digital currency like bitcoin have a built-in system to incentivize people to do the work necessary to validate transactions. \xa0 2. The main opportunity for blockchains is in the financial services industry. The financial services industry can transform itself around blockchain technology, if it can find the leadership to do it. The technology holds great promise to revolutionize the industry -- from banks to credit card networks and everything in between. When everyone shares the same public, distributed ledger, settlements occur instantly for all to see. Banks could speed up the metabolism of the system, and cut out massive costs. The smartest incumbents will use blockchain technology strategically, including permissionless systems to penetrate new markets like the unbanked and bring new services to market. Yet financial services are the tip of the iceberg. Blockchains can disrupt the disrupters like Uber. They will be at the heart of the Internet of Things -- animating the physical world by, for example, allowing smart devices to contract, transact and securely share data peer-to-peer through blockchains. They can reinvent democracy by making politicians accountable to citizens through smart contract. Imagine if a politician only received her salary or an appropriation for a project after fulfilling pre-set objectives laid bare in that smart contract. She would be beholden to the people, not powerful interests or donors. \xa0 3. Blockchains are really a B2B thing. They won\u2019t affect me personally. We\u2019re convinced that this technology will change our economy, our institutions and day-to-day life in more dramatic ways than the first era of the Internet. Here are but a few ways blockchain will help you: The list goes on. \xa0 4. Blockchains have too many problems for them to be feasible. Some say the technology is not ready for prime time; that it\u2019s still hard to use, and that the killer applications are still nascent. Other critics point to the massive amount of energy needed to reach consensus in the network: What happens when thousands or perhaps millions of interconnected blockchains are each processing billions of transactions a day? Are the incentives great enough for people to participate and behave safely over time, and not try to overpower the network? Is blockchain technology the worst job killer ever? Our research suggests such concerns should not go into a category called \u201cReasons why this is a bad idea\u201d but rather into a category called \u201cImplementation challenges.\u201d \xa0 5. Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto Early this month, Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright claimed to be the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. We know for a fact that he is not the sole creator. The reason? We -- Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott --- are among those who created bitcoin. Let us explain. Whomever wrote the original bitcoin paper and protocol got things off the ground. Then he (or she) disappeared, leaving it to an ever-growing community to carry on. This community is now responsible for the vast majority of code and other content related to bitcoin. In that sense, we are all Satoshi. Which is why it doesn\u2019t really matter who wrote the original paper. In other open source communities, such as Linux, there is an ultimate arbitrator. Bitcoin, and for that matter all permissionless blockchains, will never have such a benevolent dictator. As such the entire ecosystem needs to take the next steps in achieving bottom-up, self-organizing governance to steward these extraordinary resources forward. \xa0 (Don Tapscott and his son Alex Tapscott are authors of BLOCKCHAIN\xa0REVOLUTION:\xa0 How The Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World (May 10).

Investors at some family offices, smaller mutual funds, and traders at hedge funds say bitcoin has helped returns and demonstrated a low correlation with other asset classes.  Hopes that bitcoin would become a broadly used alternative to other currencies helped buoy its price to more than $1,000 in December 2013, when its market capitalization was $13 billion. But the market cap has retreated since then, to about $6.4 billion as of Thursday. Early enthusiasts for the crypto-currency were drawn to its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. The risks of dealing in bitcoin were laid bare in 2013 when Tokyo-based exchange Mt Gox collapsed after admitting it had lost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds. The currency\'s earlier ties to gambling and criminal websites did not endear it to traditional investors. Jeremy Millar, founder and managing partner at Ledger Partners in London, estimated that 50 to 90 percent of bitcoin\'s current $6.4 billion market cap is held by near-institutional money such as individuals at hedge funds and family offices. That has not changed over the last two years.  He does not have an estimate for institutional investment holdings of bitcoin. But he said they are likely to be insignificant, compared with the smaller investors who have fewer restrictions about fund allocation. "What is clear though is that over the last two years, bitcoin has emerged from its \'hacktivist\' origins to a more institutionalized ecosystem which includes the participation of hedge funds, traders, and professional investors," said Millar.  BITCOIN IN PORTFOLIOS Funds dedicated to investing in bitcoin are relatively small. The largest is the Pantera Bitcoin Fund, a $160 million hedge fund founded by Dan Morehead, formerly of Tiger Management, available to institutions and individuals who invest $50,000 or more. According to a Pantera Bitcoin Fund brochure, the fund was launched in July 2013, a period when bitcoin BTC=BTSP traded at around $65. On Thursday, it traded at $418.80, a gain of more than 500 percent from July 2013. The firm did not comment on fund performance or its investors. The majority of the Pantera Fund\'s investors are family offices and high net worth individuals, said two people familiar with the fund.  The Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, with assets of more than $60 million, is another vehicle for investors. GBTC is backed by bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert and his Digital Currency Group.  It is the only publicly traded U.S. security in the over-the-counter market invested in bitcoin. Volume is thin, with a few thousand shares traded daily, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Antonis Polemitis, managing director at Ledra Capital in New York, a family office specializing in education and technology, said that on average, clients have allocated 1 to 3 percent of their portfolios to bitcoin. "A lot of people will take that bet with 1 percent of their assets," he said. "A 1 percent loss does not change anyone\'s life in any way. If it goes up 10 times, then you get to feel very smart." Some investment managers say having bitcoin in portfolios has helped performance. ARK Invest, which manages four exchange-traded funds with $240 million in assets, holds GBTC in its $12 million Next Generation Internet ETF and the $7 million ARK Innovation ETF.  Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at ARK Invest in New York, said since investing in September 2015, GBTC has contributed 67 basis points to the Next Generation Internet ETF\'s return and 62 basis points to the ARK Innovation ETF.  For 2015, the Next Generation ETF posted a 15.29 percent return, while the Innovation ETF had 3.76 percent gains. For Kingsbridge Wealth Management, a multifamily office in Las Vegas with $150 million in assets, GBTC has become a great diversifier because so far it has had a low correlation with other asset classes, said David Dunn, the firm\'s founder and chief investment officer. The firm has about $1.7 million invested in bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain, Dunn said.

Ether, an alternative currency that differs from bitcoin, is\na token or digital asset of the Ethereum platform, a blockchain,\nor public ledger of all ether transactions. The platform uses\nether to execute peer-to-peer contracts automatically without\nthe need for intermediaries. The currency is often used by\nsoftware developers. "With robust regulatory oversight, we are maintaining our\nstatus at the forefront of this technological revolution and\nensuring that users have a safe and secure experience," Cuomo\nsaid in a statement. The approval by the the New York State Department of\nFinancial Services marks the state\'s first consent for a digital\ncurrency-related service beyond bitcoin. Trading on ether will begin on Monday, May 9, said Cameron\nWinklevoss, Gemini\'s co-founder and president, in an interview\nwith Reuters. Customers will be able to store their ether from\nThursday until it starts trading on the exchange on Monday. Winklevoss also said the brothers\' investment firm\nWinklevoss Capital is a "significant" holder of ether. "We started buying ether at the beginning of the year,"\nWinklevoss said. "Ethereum Foundation has a set number of ether\nthat they have set aside over a period of time..(and) the\nproceeds from that go to the funding of the foundation and the\ndevelopers to further the protocol." The Winklevoss twins chose ether to trade on their exchange\nbecause of its "unique capabilities" that are different from\nbitcoin. "There is a place for ether on our platform. It does what\nbitcoin doesn\'t do," Winklevoss said. "So that is the sort of\ncriteria: that it is different enough from bitcoin and the\nproposition is great enough that this makes sense for us to\ninclude it in our platform." According to coinmarketcap.com, ether is trading at $9.97 on\nlate Thursday, with a market capitalization of about $795\nmillion, the second largest behind bitcoin. Bitcoin currently \nhas a market cap of $6.9 billion. Daily volume for ether is\naround $20 million. Ether trades on other exchanges as well, but Winklevoss said\nthose exchanges are unregulated or unlicensed. "It\'s pretty clear that in the U.S. if you\'re an exchange,\nyou are required at the minimum a money transmission license in\neach state," Winklevoss said. "Anybody who\'s operating an ether\nexchange doesn\'t have a license and is on borrowed time." Demand for ether has steadily increased since its launch\nlast year.

Anthony Di Iorio, who has founded several companies based on the technology, filled the role at Canada\'s largest stock exchange in January, Jean Desgagne, chief executive of TMX\'s Global Enterprise Services, said in an interview. Stock exchanges are embracing blockchain, which allows Bitcoin users to conduct secure transactions without middlemen, as they seek to diversify and boost profit margins. When used to issue securities, the technology could potentially remove the need for clearing houses. "Blockchain is a disruptive technology," Desgagne said, noting that major changes could result from its potential adoption. "We\'re focused on it, we\'re going to learn." In January the Australian stock exchange said it had enlisted a blockchain startup to develop a new trade settlement system. Nasdaq in the United States used the technology last year to issue securities to an unidentified private investor. Last month, Nasdaq said it was developing a blockchain-based shareholder voting system for its Estonian stock exchange.  Blockchain could make operations "better, faster, cheaper," Desgagne said, but noted that, if adopted, the technology would be only one element in TMX\'s digital operations.

The Flux Party says its goal is to elect six senators. They\nwill propose no policies and will not follow their consciences,\nbut will support or block legislation at the direction of their\nmembers, who can swap or trade their votes on every bill online. "If they didn\'t have to be senators, if they could just be\nsoftware or robots they would be, because their only purpose is\nto do what the people want them to do," Flux Party co-founder\nMax Kaye told Reuters in an interview. Australia is set to hold an election in September or October\nafter a period of turmoil that brought five prime ministers in\nas many years. At the same time the upper house, which thanks to the quirks\nof its electoral system has a history of returning mavericks and\nfringe party candidates, has been hopelessly deadlocked by a\nhandful of senators, at least one elected on less than 1 percent\nof the vote. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last week raised the\npossibility of calling an early poll to break the gridlock that\nhas held up the government\'s legislative agenda. That type of policy inertia is what bitcoin enthusiasts Kaye\nand Flux co-founder Nathan Spataro say inspired them to explore\nalternative systems that better represent the world of 2016. Bitcoin is a web-based "cryptocurrency" used to move money\naround quickly and anonymously with no need for a central\nauthority. The technology behind it is called the blockchain - a\nmassive electronic ledger of every transaction that is verified\nand shared by a global network of computers. To Spataro and Kaye, bitcoin is not just an alternative\nfinancial system: it is the missing link between representative\ndemocracy and Democracy 2.0. "This ancient system we\'ve got of representative democracy,\nwhich at the time liberated us from monarchies and was awesome,\nnow we\'re at a point where it\'s become this monster," Spataro\nsaid. "We\'re in a society now that\'s got the Internet and when\ndemocracy in its current form was conceived, you had to sail on\na ship from England to get here. This model wasn\'t designed for\nthis world."  "DELIGHTFULLY NAIVE" Bitcoin\'s strength comes from its ability to build trust\nthrough ease of verification and by removing human frailty from\nthe equation, said Dr. Adrian Lee, an expert on bitcoin at the\nUniversity of Technology Sydney. That makes what the Flux Party is proposing both unique and\nalso potentially fraught. "I haven\'t seen a party which would vote via blockchain,"\nLee said. "If you removed the politician and made it just a\nbitcoin machine, then maybe it would work but you can\'t do\nthat," he said, noting the absence of a legally binding\nmechanism to make Flux senators vote as directed. Although the party\'s architecture for calculating and\ndistributing voters\' wishes to their elected officials uses\nhighly complex computer code, the overall idea is fairly simple. Flux members and single-issue campaigners that agree to\nsupport the party at the election are allotted bitcoin-like\ntokens that they can use themselves, trade or give to experts or\ninterest groups they trust to vote as their proxy. Outcomes are distributed proportionately, so if 80 percent\nvote in favour of a bill and 20 against, five Flux senators vote\nyea and one nay. Ministers are not often experts in their portfolio, and yet\nthey are charged with making critical decisions on issues such\nas environmental or fiscal policy. Under their system, the Flux\nParty founders say, large blocs of voters could effectively\ngrant their vote on such issues to a scientist or economist. "You get sick, you go to the doctor, right? You don\'t\nself-diagnose and you don\'t go and call your plumber," Kaye\nsaid. The Party filed its registration papers with the Australian\nElection Commission last month after obtaining the requisite\nsupport of at least 550 registered voters. Its website currently\nputs its membership at 1,009 people. Attempting to apply the transformative power of the Internet\nto democratic systems is not a new one, said Peter Chen, a\nsenior lecturer in politics at the University of Sydney, who\ncalled the Flux Party "delightfully naive people". "They\'re just the modern version of something that\'s always\nbeen around: utopian political system designers," he said.

The Flux Party says its goal is to elect six senators. They will propose no policies and will not follow their consciences, but will support or block legislation at the direction of their members, who can swap or trade their votes on every bill online. "If they didn\'t have to be senators, if they could just be software or robots they would be, because their only purpose is to do what the people want them to do," Flux Party co-founder Max Kaye told Reuters in an interview. Australia is set to hold an election in September or October after a period of turmoil that brought five prime ministers in as many years. At the same time the upper house, which thanks to the quirks of its electoral system has a history of returning mavericks and fringe party candidates, has been hopelessly deadlocked by a handful of senators, at least one elected on less than 1 percent of the vote. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last week raised the possibility of calling an early poll to break the gridlock that has held up the government\'s legislative agenda.  That type of policy inertia is what bitcoin enthusiasts Kaye and Flux co-founder Nathan Spataro say inspired them to explore alternative systems that better represent the world of 2016. Bitcoin is a web-based "cryptocurrency" used to move money around quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority. The technology behind it is called the blockchain - a massive electronic ledger of every transaction that is verified and shared by a global network of computers. To Spataro and Kaye, bitcoin is not just an alternative financial system: it is the missing link between representative democracy and Democracy 2.0. "This ancient system we\'ve got of representative democracy, which at the time liberated us from monarchies and was awesome, now we\'re at a point where it\'s become this monster," Spataro said. "We\'re in a society now that\'s got the Internet and when democracy in its current form was conceived, you had to sail on a ship from England to get here. This model wasn\'t designed for this world."  "DELIGHTFULLY NAIVE" Bitcoin\'s strength comes from its ability to build trust through ease of verification and by removing human frailty from the equation, said Dr. Adrian Lee, an expert on bitcoin at the University of Technology Sydney. That makes what the Flux Party is proposing both unique and also potentially fraught. "I haven\'t seen a party which would vote via blockchain," Lee said. "If you removed the politician and made it just a bitcoin machine, then maybe it would work but you can\'t do that," he said, noting the absence of a legally binding mechanism to make Flux senators vote as directed. Although the party\'s architecture for calculating and distributing voters\' wishes to their elected officials uses highly complex computer code, the overall idea is fairly simple. Flux members and single-issue campaigners that agree to support the party at the election are allotted bitcoin-like tokens that they can use themselves, trade or give to experts or interest groups they trust to vote as their proxy. Outcomes are distributed proportionately, so if 80 percent vote in favor of a bill and 20 against, five Flux senators vote yea and one nay.  Ministers are not often experts in their portfolio, and yet they are charged with making critical decisions on issues such as environmental or fiscal policy. Under their system, the Flux Party founders say, large blocs of voters could effectively grant their vote on such issues to a scientist or economist. "You get sick, you go to the doctor, right? You don\'t self-diagnose and you don\'t go and call your plumber," Kaye said. The Party filed its registration papers with the Australian Election Commission last month after obtaining the requisite support of at least 550 registered voters. Its website currently puts its membership at 1,009 people. Attempting to apply the transformative power of the Internet to democratic systems is not a new one, said Peter Chen, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Sydney, who called the Flux Party "delightfully naive people". "They\'re just the modern version of something that\'s always been around: utopian political system designers," he said. "They\'re obviously guys who are really focused on the tech thing and that has always been the problem with the e-democracy people. They\'re often really tech-driven and they need political scientists at the brainstorming floor to say \'well, I don\'t know if that\'d work\'."

Responding to attacks in Paris last November by Islamic State militants, the Commission is also considering imposing controls on bank transfers within the EU that are currently not monitored through the controversial EU-US Terrorist Financing Tracking Programme (TFTP). "We must cut off terrorists\' access to funds and enable authorities to better track financial flows to prevent devastating attacks such as those in Paris," EU Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement. Brussels intends to curb terrorists\' use of all means of payments, including cash and banking transactions, but will initially focus its regulatory work on prepaid cards and virtual currencies, of which Bitcoin is by far the most used with more than 80 percent of the market capitalization. "There seems to be a risk that virtual currencies may be used by terrorist organizations to conceal financial transactions, as these can be carried out more anonymously," a Commission document said. Prepaid cards raise the same sort of concerns as their users are not always identified. The French authorities have also proved their use by the Paris attackers. Prepaid cards are issued by a wide range of operators including banks using major networks, such as Visa and Mastercard. They are different from debit and credit cards because they need to be loaded before payments can be made, but can carry substantial amounts of money.  For both Bitcoin and prepaid cards, the Commission will propose new rules by the end of June forcing the identification of their users.  Users of virtual currencies may have to provide personal data when exchanging Bitcoin for real currencies. Consumers may be obliged to provide their identity when buying prepaid cards, a move that is currently not always required across the EU. The Commission plan falls short of what was requested by France, which asked for caps on amounts that can be loaded onto prepaid cards and limits on the conversion of virtual currencies into real currencies.  MORE CHECKS ON BANK TRANSFERS? The EU executive\'s plan foresees a range of other measures to be implemented by the end of 2017, including possible common rules to freeze terrorist assets across the EU and stricter checks on financial transfers involving some non-EU countries. Brussels will also assess whether it is feasible to set up a European programme to track terrorist funds, along the lines of the TFTP, which has long been opposed by EU lawmakers and privacy campaigners because it allows widespread checks on consumers\' bank transfers. A decision on whether to move forward with an EU TFTP will be made by the end of 2016.

The men, described as all in their 20s and with Dutch nationality, were arrested on Tuesday in coordinated raids on 15 locations around the country, said spokeswoman Valentine Hoen of the country\'s Fiscal Information and Investigation Service. Prosecutors believe the men laundered 15-20 million euros ($16-22 million) for drug dealers who sold their wares at online marketplaces on the "Dark Web" -- web sites that are invisible to search engines and only reachable using specialized software. Bitcoin is the preferred means of payment on such sites because it can be quickly transferred between users in any country without using a bank, making it difficult to trace.

Not because of any dark-web drug-dealing or Russian ponzi scheme, but for an altogether less sensational reason - slower growth in the money supply. Bitcoin is a web-based "cryptocurrency" used to move money around quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority. But despite being championed by some as the digital money of the future, it is often dismissed as a currency that is too volatile to invest in.  The reason 2016 looks set to be different is that bitcoin\'s price is likely to be driven in large part by similar factors to a traditional fiat currency, following the age-old principles of supply and demand.  Instead of being controlled by a central bank, bitcoin relies on so-called "mining" computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. In return, the first to solve the puzzle and thereby clear the transactions is currently rewarded with 25 new bitcoins, worth around $11,000 BTC=BTSP.  But when it was invented in 2008 by the mysterious "Satoshi Nakamoto", who has yet to be identified, the bitcoin program was designed so that the reward would be halved roughly every four years, in order to keep a lid on inflation. The next time that is due to happen is July 2016. Bitcoin was also designed to emulate a commodity by having a finite supply of 21 million bitcoins, which will be reached in around 125 years, up from around 15 million today. Hence, also, the use of the term "mining". Daniel Masters, co-founder of Jersey-based Global Advisors\' multi-million dollar bitcoin hedge fund, started his career as an oil trader at Shell in the mid-1980s and spent 30 years trading commodities before crossing over to bitcoin. Now he reckons the price of bitcoin could test its 2013 highs of above $1,100 next year and then pick up speed to rise to $4,400 by the end of 2017. That would be due to a number of factors, Masters said, including an increased acceptance of payments in bitcoin by big companies and authorities, rapidly growing interest and investment in the "blockchain" technology that underpins bitcoin transactions, and also more demand from China as its currency weakens and the economy slows.  But taken in isolation, the halving of the mining reward will increase the price of bitcoin by around 50 percent from where it is now, Masters reckons. That is despite the fact that  the halving of the reward has always been inevitable - a factor that would already have been accounted for in pretty much every other market. "If OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries)came out tomorrow and said, \'in six months\' time we\'re going to halve oil production\', the oil price would instantaneously react. But the bitcoin market is still in its infancy, and I don\'t think that factor is discounted into the price fully," he said.  DECENTRALIZED DIGITAL ASSET Bitcoin\'s price has already almost doubled in the last three months, putting it on track for its best quarter in two years. It hit $500 last month for the first time since August last year, with Chinese demand for a pyramid scheme set up by a Russian fraudster cited as a reason for the price surge.  But Bobby Lee, the chief executive of one of the leading bitcoin exchanges in China, BTCC, reckons there is scope for the cryptocurrency to go much further. He thinks the price could increase by as much as eight times in the time up to the reward halving, taking it as high as $3,500 by next summer.         "Today the worth of bitcoin is $1 per capita in the world (population)," Lee said, referring to the value of all the bitcoins in circulation, around $6.5 billion. "For such an innovative, decentralized digital asset, I say \'boy, are we undervaluing it\'. But it takes a while for people to realize that." The mining reward has already been halved once before, in November 2012, from 50 to 25 bitcoins. The stakes were much lower then, with one bitcoin worth around $12, but nevertheless the price increased by about 150 percent in the preceding seven months - roughly the time left before the next halving.  "It (the halving) dampens supply so, all other things being equal, that puts upwards pressure on price," said Jeremy Millar, partner at London-based financial technology specialists Magister Advisors, who expects demand to continue to increase. "No one can argue with that fundamental economic principle."

An Australian entrepreneur and academic, Craig Steven Wright, is the latest candidate, outed in articles by Wired magazine and technology news website Gizmodo hours before his home and office in Sydney were searched by police. Both articles said investigations based on leaked emails, documents and web archives pointed strongly to Wright being "Nakamoto". "Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he\'s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did," said Wired. But the search has already tripped up several journalists, most famously Newsweek\'s Leah McGrath Goodman, who identified Japanese American Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto in March 2014 as bitcoin\'s creator.\xa0 Dorian Nakamoto denied it - as has nearly everyone else alleged to be the mastermind credited with writing the paper, protocol and software in 2008 that gave rise to bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology. \xa0 Unmasking the "real" Nakamoto would be significant both for the future development of bitcoin and, potentially, the currency\'s market value. While any changes to the bitcoin protocol can only be implemented by consensus, the proven founder of the cryptocurrency could hold considerable sway. "Decision-making power doesn\'t rest with any individual, but Nakamoto is such a mythical figure, if he appears he could become a sort of messiah to the community," said Roberto Capodieci, a Singapore-based entrepreneur focusing on the blockchain.  ELECTRONIC MINERS  Persuading that community is not easy: while the system is decentralised by design, a cluster of so-called bitcoin miners based in China are key, Antony Lewis, a Singapore-based bitcoin consultant, said. Unlike traditional currency, bitcoins are not distributed by a central bank or backed by physical assets such as gold, but are "mined" using computers to calculate increasingly complex algorithmic formulas.    Miners run pools of computers that process transactions and create new bitcoins, an energy intensive business that has frozen out all but a handful of players.  The group effectively scuttled a recent effort by one key bitcoin thinker to make processing simpler and cheaper, Lewis said.\xa0 David Moskowitz, Singapore-based founder of start-up bitcoin brokerage Coin Republic, said knowing who Nakamoto was would be significant "because people are looking for a core voice behind (bitcoin). It would help us understand what Satoshi thought". Then there\'s the fact that bitcoin researchers believe he or she may be holding up to 1 million bitcoins, which if sold today would fetch $414 million. If Nakamoto chose to sell out, or even hinted that he might, that would push the price down, reducing the incentive to mine which might in turn provoke a steeper fall in the currency, Lewis said.\xa0 On the other hand, Nakamoto could help reduce uncertainty by reassuring bitcoin users he was not going to sell his holdings in one go or, more drastically, do something called "burning" \u2014 publicly deleting the coin by sending them to a bitcoin address to which he or she did not have the key. "It would be like throwing the money into the bottom of the sea, and reduces the uncertainty of dumping onto the market," said Lewis.  "MR BITCOIN" Wright has not commented publicly on the Wired and Gizmodo reports, and Reuters attempts to contact him using various listed email addresses were unsuccessful. Fellow tenants at the north Sydney office building listed as the address of one of his companies described him as "an outgoing guy", who they nicknamed "Mr Bitcoin" because he had once offered to pay for some work in the currency. And even if Wright did admit to being Nakamoto, he would still have to prove it. That could be done by announcing he would move some of the bitcoin believed to belong to him, and then doing so, or signing a message with one of the encryption keys used in emails known to have been written by Nakamoto when bitcoin first appeared. Wright has not been a prominent member of the bitcoin community, but he has appeared at several gatherings in the past year or two.  Moskowitz, who met him at a Singapore conference last year, said he was interesting and pleasant to talk to. "He\'s clearly very intelligent and fits the profile," he said.

Wired magazine, which along with fellow U.S. publication Gizmodo published a story outing Wright based on a stash of leaked documents and emails, called him a genius. But interviews with those who have done business with Wright, and a closer inspection of documents published by the two technology websites paint a more complex picture. They point to a smart but sometimes abrasive figure facing growing legal and financial problems at least in part caused by his involvement with bitcoin. While it was not immediately possible to support or refute claims that he is Satoshi Nakamoto - the person or group credited with writing the paper, protocols and software that led to bitcoin - some of those who worked with Wright raised questions about the timing of the leak and the likelihood that he was Nakamoto. "It can\'t be him, there\'s no way he could have kept quiet about it this long," said a former senior employee at Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence, who also detailed Wright\'s difficulties with authorities over his Australian businesses\' bitcoin dealings. The former employee, who asked to remain anonymous, citing legal issues, said the collapse of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox in early 2014 had a direct effect on Hotwire, which is registered in Australia and is in the hands of administrators attempting to unravel disputes with the Australian Tax Office (ATO). The collapse of Mt. Gox and the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars\' worth of bitcoin coincided with a decision by the ATO, according to the documents, not to regard Wright\'s bitcoin as money and that the digital currency therefore was taxable like any other commodity. This punctured Hotwire\'s hopes it could recover more than A$3 million in tax credits and helped sink the company. "Their cash flow disappeared right around the time Mt. Gox collapsed," the former employee told Reuters, adding that staff at Hotwire were told that Wright had funds in a bitcoin trust, in which he was a beneficiary along with other unnamed parties. "When they were trying to find cash flow after they were hit by Mt. Gox, they couldn\'t sell the bitcoins in the trust to get the cashflow because they couldn\'t break this wallet as there are other trustees." Wright has not commented publicly on the Wired and Gizmodo reports, and Reuters\' attempts to contact him using various listed email addresses were unsuccessful. Wright\'s blog was taken down on Wednesday, his Twitter and Google+ accounts were deleted and access to his full LinkedIn profile restricted. Attempts to reach Wright\'s lawyer were unsuccessful and another former Hotwire employee said all staff had been instructed not to speak to the media. Wright\'s whereabouts are unknown. The landlord at his rented Sydney home told a Reuters reporter that Wright had been due to move out with his family before Christmas to move to London, where he recently attended a conference and was, according to his LinkedIn profile, enrolled for a Master\'s degree at University of London.  UNMASKING THE MYSTERIOUS NAKAMOTO The ATO was behind raids by Australian police on Wednesday on Wright\'s home and office in Sydney. It declined to provide any further detail on the raids, citing legal confidentiality. Administrator McGrath Nicol told creditors last month that the ATO slapped a A$1.7 million fine on Hotwire over its tax refund claims. The former Hotwire employee said Wright once paid in bitcoin to buy a banking platform from a Middle Eastern seller. He then sought to claim a goods and services tax return, or import credit, in cash worth millions of dollars which the ATO denied. Bitcoin experts say that unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto would be significant for the industry. Not only would the proven founder likely hold some sway over the future of the bitcoin protocol, but Nakamoto may also hold enough bitcoin to influence the price of bitcoin. "What people are looking for essentially is the Bill Gates of bitcoin," said David Glance, a director of innovation at the University of Western Australia and noted bitcoin expert, who doubts that Wright is Nakamato, pointing to pro-capitalist, anti-hacking columns Wright wrote for The Conversation, a local publication, in 2011. After ditching several directorships in July, Wright remains a director of three companies, including Hotwire, which had sought to launch the world\'s first bitcoin bank. McGrath Nicol noted in one report that the merging of bitcoin and cash transactions in the web of companies involving Wright "has made our review more difficult." Wright\'s attempt to go offline in recent days contrasts with the outgoing, self-promoting figure painted by former employees, neighbouring businesses at his Sydney offices and other acquaintances. His Youtube account, now also deleted, contained videos of him rowing in the gym attempting to break records, while his LinkedIn profile contained a long list of academic qualifications.  Asked about a statement on that profile that Wright was "engaged as digital forensic expert and trainer with the Australian Federal Police", the AFP said Wright was engaged to provide a technical report to support an investigation. "He was really outgoing, we used to call him Mr. Bitcoin," said an employee of a neighbouring business while Wright\'s offices were searched.

Gox and the disappearance of hundreds of\nmillions of dollars\' worth of bitcoin coincided with a decision\nby the ATO, according to the documents, not to regard Wright\'s\nbitcoin as money and that the digital currency therefore was\ntaxable like any other commodity. This punctured Hotwire\'s hopes\nit could recover more than A$3 million in tax credits and helped\nsink the company. "Their cash flow disappeared right around the time Mt. Gox\ncollapsed," the former employee told Reuters, adding that staff\nat Hotwire were told that Wright had funds in a bitcoin trust,\nin which he was a beneficiary along with other unnamed parties. "When they were trying to find cash flow after they were hit\nby Mt. Gox, they couldn\'t sell the bitcoins in the trust to get\nthe cashflow because they couldn\'t break this wallet as there\nare other trustees." Wright has not commented publicly on the Wired and Gizmodo\nreports, and Reuters\' attempts to contact him using various\nlisted email addresses were unsuccessful. Wright\'s blog was\ntaken down on Wednesday, his Twitter and Google+ accounts were\ndeleted and access to his full LinkedIn profile restricted. Attempts to reach Wright\'s lawyer were unsuccessful and\nanother former Hotwire employee said all staff had been\ninstructed not to speak to the media. Wright\'s whereabouts are unknown. The landlord at his rented\nSydney home told a Reuters reporter that Wright had been due to\nmove out with his family before Christmas to move to London,\nwhere he recently attended a conference and was, according to\nhis LinkedIn profile, enrolled for a Master\'s degree at\nUniversity of London.  UNMASKING THE MYSTERIOUS NAKAMOTO The ATO was behind raids by Australian police on Wednesday\non Wright\'s home and office in Sydney. It declined to provide\nany further detail on the raids, citing legal confidentiality. Administrator McGrath Nicol told creditors last month that\nthe ATO slapped a A$1.7 million fine on Hotwire over its tax\nrefund claims. The former Hotwire employee said Wright once paid\nin bitcoin to buy a banking platform from a Middle Eastern\nseller. He then sought to claim a goods and services tax return,\nor import credit, in cash worth millions of dollars which the\nATO denied. Bitcoin experts say that unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto would be\nsignificant for the industry. Not only would the proven founder\nlikely hold some sway over the future of the bitcoin protocol,\nbut Nakamoto may also hold enough bitcoin to influence the price\nof bitcoin. "What people are looking for essentially is the Bill Gates\nof bitcoin," said David Glance, a director of innovation at the\nUniversity of Western Australia and noted bitcoin expert, who\ndoubts that Wright is Nakamato, pointing to pro-capitalist,\nanti-hacking columns Wright wrote for The Conversation, a local\npublication, in 2011. After ditching several directorships in July, Wright remains\na director of three companies, including Hotwire, which had\nsought to launch the world\'s first bitcoin bank. McGrath Nicol noted in one report that the merging of\nbitcoin and cash transactions in the web of companies involving\nWright "has made our review more difficult." Wright\'s attempt to go offline in recent days contrasts with\nthe outgoing, self-promoting figure painted by former employees,\nneighbouring businesses at his Sydney offices and other\nacquaintances. His Youtube account, now also deleted, contained videos of\nhim rowing in the gym attempting to break records, while his\nLinkedIn profile contained a long list of academic\nqualifications. Asked about a statement on that profile that Wright was\n"engaged as digital forensic expert and trainer with the\nAustralian Federal Police", the AFP said Wright was engaged to\nprovide a technical report to support an investigation. "He was really outgoing, we used to call him Mr. Bitcoin,"\nsaid an employee of a neighbouring business while Wright\'s\noffices were searched.

More than a dozen federal police officers entered a house registered on the electoral roll to Craig Steven Wright, whom Wired outed as the likely real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous figure that first released bitcoin\'s code in 2009. Locksmiths broke open the door of the property, in a suburb on Sydney\'s north shore. When asked what they were doing, one officer told a Reuters reporter they were "clearing the house". A reporter who approached an office listed as the location of two of Wright\'s registered businesses, DeMorgan Ltd and Panopticrypt Pty Ltd, in another Sydney suburb, was turned away by police with one officer saying: "There\'s an operation going on at the moment, I can\'t answer any questions." Several police officers could be seen speaking with workers inside. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has long been a mystery that journalists and bitcoin enthusiasts have tried to unravel. The police raids in Australia came hours after Wired magazine and technology website Gizmodo published articles saying that their investigations showed Wright, an entrepreneur and academic, was most probably the secretive bitcoin creator. Wright is the chief executive of Australian-registered DeMorgan Ltd, which he describes on his Linkedin page as "a pre-IPO Australian listed company focused on alternative currency".  The Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a statement that the officers\' "presence at Mr. Wright\'s property is not associated with the media reporting overnight about bitcoins". The AFP referred all inquiries about the raids to the Australian Tax Office, which said it could not comment on "any individual\'s or entity\'s tax affairs" due to legal confidentiality. Emails to various addresses listed for Wright did not receive a reply. The Wired and Gizmodo investigations were based on leaked emails, documents and web archives, including what was said to be a transcript of a meeting between Wright and Australian tax officials. "Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he\'s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did," Wired said. Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the documents and transcripts quoted in the reports.  POWERFUL COMPUTERS At Wright\'s rented home, a modest brick house in the leafy middle class suburb of Gordon, three police workers wearing white gloves could be seen searching the garage, which contained gym equipment.  A man who identified himself as the owner of the house, Garry Hayres, told Reuters that Wright and his family had lived there for a year, and were due to move out on Dec. 22 to move to Britain. Hayres said that Wright had a "substantial computer system set-up" and had attached a "three-phase" power system to the back of the house for extra power. Police personnel at Wright\'s office in nearby Ryde wore shirts tagged "Computer Forensics". A fellow business tenant at the building, who declined to be named, said Wright had not been seen there in the past week. Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym of the person or group of people who authored the paper, protocol and software that gave rise to bitcoin. The New York Times, Newsweek and other publications have guessed at Nakamoto\'s real identity, but none has proved conclusive. Newsweek identified a Japanese-American called Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto in March 2014, but he has steadfastly denied being the author of cryptocurrency. Uncovering Nakamoto\'s real identity would be significant, not just to solving a long-standing riddle, but for the future of the world\'s most commonly used virtual currency. Unlike traditional currency, bitcoins are not distributed by a central bank or backed by physical assets like gold, but are "mined" by users who use computers to calculate increasingly complex algorithmic formulas.    As an early miner of bitcoins, Nakamoto is also sitting on about 1 million bitcoins, worth more than $400 million at present exchange rates, according to bitcoin expert Sergio Demian Lerner.  The treatment of bitcoin for tax purposes in Australia has been the subject of considerable debate. The ATO ruled in December 2014 that cryptocurrency should be considered an asset, rather than a currency, for capital gains tax purposes.

An investor in bitcoin at the start of October would have\nenjoyed a return of over 36 percent, dwarfing the\nreturn of about 2 percent that the dollar racked up for its\nholders. The web-based currency surged to its highest this year on\nFriday, hitting $334.05 on the Bitstamp exchange on\nits ninth successive day of gains, its best run in over two\nyears. Bitcoin is used as a vehicle for moving money around the\nworld quickly and anonymously via the web without the need for\nthird-party verification. That has made it controversial, but\nalso attractive, to users ranging from drug dealers to those\ntrying to circumvent capital controls in Greece and China. Some bitcoin traders speculate that the latter might be\npartly responsible for the digital currency\'s latest surge. Most\ntrading in the past month has come from Chinese bitcoin\nexchanges, according to Bitcoinity.org, though the accuracy of\nthe Chinese exchanges\' data is questioned. "At a time of central bank currency devaluations, direct and\nindirect, and with gold\'s directionless behaviour over the last\ntwo years ... bitcoin is increasingly viewed and marketed as a\npossible investable vehicle," said London-based trader Ashraf\nLaidi, who invests in both fiat currencies and bitcoin. Bitcoin is often dismissed as too volatile to invest in,\nhaving soared towards $1,200 in late 2013 before sliding to\nbelow $400 less than a month later, but it has stabilised this\nyear. "What I\'m happy about so far is that the price run-up hasn\'t\nbeen overly dramatic or disorganised," said Peter Smith, CEO of\nBlockchain, a bitcoin "wallet" or storage provider, which shares\nits name with the technology.  EU RULING Last week the European Union\'s top court ruled that bitcoin\nshould be treated like any other means of payment and therefore\nbe exempt from value-added tax - a decision many in the industry\nsay helped push up bitcoin\'s price. "It just makes bitcoin a lot more usable as a currency in\nEurope and also provides a lot of clarity to people who are\nspeculating and trading in it," said Tom Robinson, co-founder of\nLondon-based bitcoin storage firm Elliptic. Another reason for the price surge might be that bitcoin\nsupply is set to grow more slowly. The blockchain is secured by a network of computers that\ncompete with each other to solve mathematical problems for a\nreward. That is currently 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes, but that\nwill be halved to 12.5 bitcoins next year. In the same way that scaling back quantitative easing would\nprop up a traditional fiat currency, bitcoin could be boosted by\nthe conventional economics of supply and demand. Although many say the technology behind bitcoin holds more\npotential than bitcoin itself and can function without it,\nbitcoiners argue that the blockchain supporting the currency is\nthe only one to have been properly tested. An increased focus on the technology is helping prop up the\nprice, they say. "The idea of blockchain and bitcoin are completely\ninseparable," said Michael Sonnenshein, a former JPMorgan banker\nwho is now head of business development at Grayscale\nInvestments, a New York-based bitcoin investment firm.  "The blockchain is only as secure and as powerful as it is\nbecause there is this constant movement of tokens (bitcoins) on\nthe blockchain." \n\n (Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Tom Heneghan)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N12R3NQ20151030', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 30, 12, 47), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'REFILE-Biting back: bitcoin heads for best month in 1-1/2 yrs'}, {'articleText': u' LONDON Nov 5 Bitcoin fell around $100 in 24\nhours to trade at just under $400 on Thursday, with watchers of\nthe web-based "cryptocurrency" citing reports of a ponzi scheme\nas undermining bitcoin\'s appeal as a credible investment. Bitcoin surged above $500 on the Bitstamp exchange\n on Wednesday, before falling back to $408 later in\nthe day as reports spread of a wave of new Chinese members of a\nbitcoin pyramid scheme set up by a Russian con artist. On\nThursday it fell another 3 percent, to $395. The so-called "social finance network" to which the Chinese\nhave allegedly been thronging is MMM. According to British\nnewspaper the Financial Times, which ran the story on its front\npage on Thursday, the network is run by Sergey Mavrodi, a former\nmember of the Russian parliament once jailed on fraud charges. The scheme\'s website, which says it wants "honest people to\nparticipate together to make the world a better place", promises\na 30 percent monthly return, with a 10 percent bonus for\nreferring another person to the scheme. "Today\'s sharp sell-off was accelerated by the publicized\nreappearance of possibly another scandal in the form of an\nemerging Ponzi scheme, which elicits fears of a \'not-again\' blow\nto bitcoin," said fiat currency and bitcoin trader Ashfaf Laidi. Bitcoin is used as a vehicle for moving money around the\nworld quickly and anonymously via the web without the need for\nthird-party verification. That has made it controversial, but\nalso attractive, to users ranging from drug dealers to those\ntrying to circumvent capital controls in Greece and China. Bitcoin soared to over $1,100 in late 2013 before sliding to\nbelow $400 less than a month later, but until this week, the\nview among investors was that it had stabilised this year. "A comparatively small and illiquid market got\nover-stretched and did its usual ping back," said London-based\nbitcoin firm Quantave CEO Paul Gordon in response to the price\nfall. Gordon said bitcoin had seen similar price moves over the\npast few years when news had emerged of ponzi schemes. The digital currency is still up over 25 percent this week,\nhowever. If it holds onto those gains, that would make this its\nbest week in 18 months, and would mark an eight straight weeks\nof price increases - bitcoin\'s best run in two years. Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, likened the gyrations in the\nprice of bitcoin to a "windmill". While cautioning that he was a\nvery poor bitcoin trader himself and does not buy and sell the\ncurrency, he said on Wednesday he expected the price to fall\nback to the $250 range after the recent surge. He cited the recent decision to include the bitcoin symbol\nin the "Unicode" alphabet that\'s used for computer keyboards as\none possible factor in the price spike. Quantave\'s Gordon added that the fact the Chinese bitcoin\nexchange BTC China was now accepting bank deposits to buy\nbitcoin, having stopped allowing direct transfers in 2013, had\nbeen an important factor in the increased demand from China. \n\n (Additional reporting by Jonathan Weber in San Francisco,\nediting by David Evans)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Jemima Kelly'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1305BO20151105', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 5, 13, 10), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin falls over $100 in a day on reports of ponzi scheme'}, {'articleText': u' SAN FRANCISCO A former U.S. Secret Service agent received a 71-month prison sentence on Monday for diverting to his personal account over $800,000 worth of bitcoins during an investigation into online drug marketplace Silk Road, a Justice Department spokesman said.

Bitcoin, a web-based \'cryptocurrency\', provides a vehicle\nfor moving money across the world quickly and anonymously\nwithout the need for third-party verification. That has made it\nattractive to all sorts of users, from drug dealers to Greeks\ntrying to get around capital controls. On Saturday, a rival version of the current software was\nreleased by two bitcoin big guns: Gavin Andresen, who was chosen\nby the currency\'s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, as his\nsuccessor when he stepped aside in 2011, and Mike Hearn, who\nalong with Andresen is one of five senior developers. For months Andresen and Hearn have been locked in an\nargument with the other three lead programmers over whether the\n"blocks" in which bitcoin transactions are processed should be\nenlarged from their current 1 megabyte, so as to enable more\nthan three payments to be processed per second. The new version, which calls itself Bitcoin XT, would\nincrease the block size to 8 megabytes, which would allow up to\n24 transactions to be processed every second. That is still a\nfraction of the 20,000 or so that VISA can process, but would\nincrease every year, so that bitcoin could continue to grow. Those who oppose Bitcoin XT say the bigger block size\njeopardises the vision of a decentralised payments system that\nbitcoin is built on, as the extra computer memory needed would\nshut out many of the thousands of individual "nodes" that\ncurrently power the network. Some reckon the split could spell the end of bitcoin. But\nHearn, speaking to Reuters on Tuesday, said that whether or not\nBitcoin XT was adopted, the crypocurrency would live on.

Bitcoin traders do not seem too worried: though the price\nhas dropped around 4 percent since Saturday to $252.90 on the\nBitstamp exchange, that is a modest fall for the\nvolatile currency, which earlier in the month shed over 6\npercent in a single day.

For months Andresen and Hearn have been locked in an\nargument with the other three lead programmers over whether the\n"blocks" in which bitcoin transactions are processed should be\nenlarged from their current 1 megabyte, so as to enable more\nthan three payments to be processed per second. The new version, which calls itself Bitcoin XT, would\nincrease the block size to 8 megabytes, which would allow up to\n24 transactions to be processed every second. That is still a\nfraction of the 20,000 or so that VISA can process, but would\nincrease every year, so that bitcoin could continue to grow. Those who oppose Bitcoin XT say the bigger block size\njeopardises the vision of a decentralised payments system that\nbitcoin is built on, as the extra computer memory needed would\nshut out many of the thousands of individual "nodes" that\ncurrently power the network. Some reckon the split could spell the end of bitcoin. But\nHearn, speaking to Reuters on Tuesday, said that whether or not\nBitcoin XT was adopted, the crypocurrency would live on. "If we thought it might be the end of bitcoin, we wouldn\'t\ndo it," he said. He added that around 10 percent of nodes had\nalready signed up to use Bitcoin XT since Saturday. Bitcoin traders do not seem too worried: though the price\nhas dropped around 4 percent since Saturday to $252.90 on the\nBitstamp exchange, that is a modest fall for the\nvolatile currency, which earlier in the month shed over 6\npercent in a single day.  SCALING UP Andresen and Hearn argue that it was Nakamoto\'s intention\nfor bitcoin to be scaled up as technology developed so that it\ncould widen its reach. But opponents argue that bitcoin was \nnever intended as a rival to traditional payments systems. "I have followed this from the beginning & I agree that it\nis an attempted governance coup," tweeted Jon Matonis, founding\ndirector of the Washington, D.C.-based Bitcoin Foundation, of\nwhich Andresen himself is chief scientist. The Bitcoin XT software has been programmed so that no\nchange will happen before Jan. 11. If, by that stage, 75 percent\nof the "miners" - computers that validate bitcoin transactions -\nhave signed up, the software will automatically switch to\nBitcoin XT. If 75 percent is not reached, it will not. Until then, the issue is likely to continue to be debated\nhotly. Someone purporting to be Nakamoto himself has even\nweighed into online discussions, backing the Bitcoin Core group\nand calling Bitcoin XT a "pretender-Bitcoin". But the user has\nwidely been dismissed as a fake. "Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of\ncharismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen,\nBarack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto," the user wrote.\n\n (Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Jemima Kelly'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N10T1TH20150818', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 8, 18, 15, 2), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"Developers split over bitcoin's future as rival software emerges"}, {'articleText': u' NEW YORK Armed with a doctorate in financial engineering, 34-year-old Timo Schlaefer was on his way to\xa0a promising career at Goldman Sachs in London. Previously with the bank\'s mergers and acquisitions team, he became an executive director of credit quantitative modeling at Goldman, where quants like Schlaefer are highly valued. In February he gave that up, and launched a company called Crypto Facilities Ltd, a bitcoin derivatives trading platform, which now has six employees. For now, the platform trades bitcoin forwards, which are directly linked to the price of bitcoin, but it\'s also developing other digital currency derivative products.  "This is uncharted territory," said Schlaefer. "It\'s an exciting opportunity to participate in a new area of technology that has massive potential." Bitcoin is a virtual or online currency created through a "mining" process where a computer\'s resources are used to perform millions of calculations. Once mined, bitcoins can be  stored in an online wallet, traded in an online exchange, or used to buy goods and services.   Once the province of small-time investors driven by their distrust of government-backed currencies, now Wall Street bankers and traders are leaving high-paying jobs to join bitcoin start-ups, while big firms hire in-house to get their arms around bitcoin and the related \'blockchain\' technology. "A lot of people are entering the bitcoin space as the sector has reached an overall level of funding that\'s hard to ignore," said Jaron Lukasiewicz, founder and chief executive officer at New York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter. Lukasiewicz, 29, moved to the bitcoin world in late 2012, having left behind a six-figure salary in private equity at The CapStreet Group in New York. Bitcoin is not backed by a government and its value fluctuates. On Thursday, it was trading at $278 BTC=BTSP, making the value of outstanding bitcoin worth about $4 billion. It has had a volatile history, with a rapid rally in 2013 that boosted its value to more than $1,150 per bitcoin at one point. Right now, Crypto Facilities\' Schlaefer probably won\'t make anywhere near the kind of money that he would potentially earn at Goldman. But it\'s less about the compensation for Schlaefer and more about being part of the growth in bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain. The blockchain - a ledger or list of all of a digital currency\'s transactions - is viewed as bitcoin\'s main technological innovation, allowing users to make payments anonymously, instantly, and without government regulation. Software engineers have started developing multiple applications for the blockchain, including a land title record system in Honduras to the clearing of trades in financial markets. Meanwhile, Wall Street firms are doing their own hiring in the cryptocurrency realm. In June, online bitcoin job ads surged to a record high of 306, according to data from Wanted Analytics, with demand coming from banks such as Capital One and tech companies such as Intel and Amazon. In previous months, Citigroup and TD Canada Trust posted bitcoin job ads as well.  RISKY BUSINESS For 31-year-old Paul Chou, founder and chief executive officer of Ledger X, an institutional trading and clearing platform for bitcoin options, moving into the digital currency space represents what he hopes results in lucrative profits down the road. But there are other reasons for his shift. LedgerX is awaiting regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to trade and clear options on bitcoin. Chou said the firm hopes to operate the first regulated exchange and clearinghouse to list and clear fully-collateralized, physically-settled bitcoin options for the institutional market. "I took a very large salary pay cut to do this, in return for equity in a start-up that can be worth a lot someday," Chou said.  Before LedgerX, Chou worked at Goldman Sachs in New York as a quant equity trader after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with degrees in computer science and mathematics. Chou said his hours are much longer as an entrepreneur - he\'s constantly refining ideas for strategy and thinking which areas to focus on. "The domain expertise, relationships, and career equity I\'ve built are things I never could have done while at Goldman," Chou said. "As a former trader, I\'m glad I made this trade-off at the stage of my career that I did." It\'s a risky move, however. There are already several tales of bitcoin company failures and mismanagement. U.S. bitcoin marketplace Buttercoin, for instance, shuttered its operations in April this year despite raising $1.3 million in funding. Bitcoin exchange MyCoin closed its doors in February of 2015, leaving about 3,000 investors out of pocket. \xa0\xa0\xa0 Tokyo-based Mt. Gox,\xa0once one of the most dominant bitcoin exchanges, closed its doors without warning in February last year, filing for bankruptcy and leaving investors approximately $500 million in the red.  BITCOIN INVESTMENTS, HIRING Total investments in bitcoin companies for the first half of 2015 - totaling $375.4 million - have already exceeded 2014\'s total of $339.4 million, data from CB Insights showed. Last year\'s venture capital funding of bitcoin start-ups grew roughly 280 percent from 2013. The number of bitcoin start-ups has increased by more than 80 percent from last year. As of end-July, there were 814 start-up digital currency companies, up from 444 a year earlier, according to Angel List, an online marketplace for start-ups seeking to raise money from angel investors.  As banks defer compensation and add more clawback provisions that give them the right to limit bonuses, traders are seeing better risk opportunities elsewhere, said San Francisco-based Rick Henri Chan, chief operating officer at Airbitz, a digital wallet platform.  Chan, 47, who joined the bitcoin industry three years ago, worked for Deutsche Bank as head of its over-the-counter derivatives technology in Japan, and was a trader at UBS and Morgan Stanley.  He works long hours at Airbitz, doing everything from strategy to raising money, but the work environment is more flexible. At Deutsche, Chan had a multi-million dollar package, and he admits to missing that paycheck. "But we\'re doing something special here at Airbitz. And I do think our company will be valued at a lot more in the future," he said.

Carl Force, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\nagent, admitted to charges of extortion, money laundering and\nobstruction of justice. In a San Francisco federal court on\nMonday, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg said the scope of\nhis betrayal was "breathtaking." U.S. prosecutors had requested an 87-month prison sentence,\nwhile Force\'s attorneys asked for a four year sentence. Force\'s attorneys said he deserved less time partly because\nof mental health issues. In court on Monday, Force apologized to\nthe American people, and to his family. "I\'m sorry, I lost it and I don\'t understand a lot of it,"\nForce said. Silk Road operated for more than two years until it was shut\ndown in October 2013, generating more than $214 million in sales\nof drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoins, prosecutors\nsaid. Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road\'s creator who authorities say used\nthe alias "Dread Pirate Roberts," was sentenced to life in\nprison in May after a federal jury in Manhattan found him guilty\nof several charges, including distributing drugs through the\nInternet. Prosecutors also reached a plea agreement with Shaun\nBridges, a former Secret Service agent who was charged along\nwith Force in March with stealing bitcoins, the web-based\ndigital currency, during the investigation. Force and Bridges belonged to a Baltimore-based federal task\nforce that investigated Silk Road. Force played a prominent\nrole, communicating with Ulbricht while posing as a drug dealer\nnamed "Nob," prosecutors said. According to a government document, Force, operating as\n"Nob," in August 2013 convinced Ulbricht to pay him $50,000 in\nbitcoins by pretending he had information on the investigation. While Force reported the discussion to the DEA, he falsely\nclaimed no payment had been made but instead diverted the\nbitcoins to a personal account, prosecutors said. Force, also without authorities\' knowledge, used another\nonline moniker, "French Maid," and offered Ulbricht information\non the investigation for about $98,000 in bitcoins in September\n2013, prosecutors said.\n\n (Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Chris\nReese)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Dan Levine'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N12J2IL20151019', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 19, 18, 19), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Ex-U.S. agent gets over six years for bitcoin theft in Silk Road probe'}, {'articleText': u' SYDNEY Australia\'s major banks are closing accounts of bitcoin companies, forcing at least 13 digital currency providers out of business in response to tougher rules on money laundering and terrorism finance, an industry body spokesman said on Tuesday. The move comes just months after Westpac Banking Corp became the last of Australia\'s four major banks to pull out of the remittances business in order to reduce compliance risks. Banks globally are exiting sectors that present compliance headaches under pressure from regulators to meet tighter anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules.  "The current bitcoin operating model requires very tough compliance and assurance requirements to ensure we meet the high standards required under anti-money laundering regulations," a Westpac spokesman said. "We continue to monitor developments in bitcoin, including their regulation." Banks have sent letters to 17 bitcoin companies including BitTrade and Buyabitcoin informing them their accounts would be closed, an Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) spokesman said. "We continue to speak with banks to find a solution to the problem. ADCCA looks forward to guidance from the government as to how the situation can be resolved," he said. Seven percent of the world\'s $5 billion worth of bitcoin is in circulation in Australia, according to ADCCA estimates. Commonwealth Bank of Australia declined to comment while National Australia Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group did not immediately respond. An Australian government inquiry last month said that while digital currencies should be more tightly regulated, they also should be treated as money and taxes should be simplified for people who trade with them.

Trendon Shavers, who authorities said defrauded investors after raising more than $4.5 million worth of bitcoins while operating Bitcoin Savings and Trust, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of securities fraud. "I know what I did was wrong, and I\'m very sorry," Shavers said in court. Under a plea deal, Shavers has agreed not to appeal any sentence at or below 41 months in prison. Sentencing before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan is scheduled for Feb. 3. Shavers, who went by "pirateat40" online, was arrested in November, two months after a federal judge in Texas ordered him to pay $40.7 million in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit. Prosecutors said Shavers, who turned 33 on Monday, raised at least 764,000 bitcoins worth more than $4.5 million based on the average price of bitcoin during the period of the scheme from investors from September 2011 to September 2012. He promised interest rates of 7 percent per week or 3,641 percent a year. The indictment said Shavers solicited the investments on the website Bitcoin Forum, offering to pay interest to investors who loaned bitcoins to Bitcoin Savings and Trust while he pursued a market arbitrage strategy. Michael Ferrara, a prosecutor, in court on Monday said Shavers had invested some of the bitcoins with Mt. Gox, the now-defunct Tokoyo-based bitcoin exchange. But Ferrara said Shavers, who lived in McKinney, Texas, largely instead used new investors\' bitcoins to pay back prior investors. "In other words, he had the telltale signs of a Ponzi scheme," Ferrara said. In court papers, prosecutors had also accused Shavers of misappropriating bitcoins to buy a used BMW M5 sedan and a $1,000 steakhouse dinner in Las Vegas, and to go to spas and casinos. At the peak of the scheme, Shavers controlled about 7 percent of bitcoins in public circulation, prosecutors said. In total, prosecutors said he misappropriated 146,000 bitcoins and caused 48 investors to suffer losses. The case is U.S. v.

The charges, which were filed on Friday, said Karpeles embezzled total 321 million yen ($2.66 million) by transferring clients' funds deposited at Mt.Gox's bank account to other accounts, Jiji reported. The prosecutors' office was not available for comment. The money was spent on buying computer software development rights and an expensive custom-built bed, Jiji said, quoting sources familiar with the matter.  Karpeles was suspected of falsifying data on the outstanding balance of the exchange, at one point the world's largest hub for trading the digital currency, Japanese media reported at the time of his arrest.

Although absolute figures are hard to come by, Greek\ninterest has surged in the online "cryptocurrency", which is out\nof the reach of monetary authorities and can be transferred at\nthe touch of a smartphone screen. New customers depositing at least 50 euros with BTCGreece,\nthe only Greece-based bitcoin exchange, open only to Greeks,\nrose by 400 percent between May and June, according to its\nfounder Thanos Marinos, who put the number at "a few thousand".\nThe average deposit quadrupled to around 700 euros.

Most bitcoin-watchers reckon the digital currency\'s rise is\nmostly due to speculators betting that capital controls would\ntrigger heavy demand.

The Luxembourg-based court, set up to make sure EU law is\napplied equally across member states, is still considering the\napplication but often follows the advice of its\nadvocates-general. The business of exchanging bitcoin for other currencies\ncounted as a transaction which was exempt from duty under EU VAT\nregulations, Advocate General Juliane Kokott wrote in her\nopinion. Bitcoin-focused businesses welcomed her view, though the\ncourt has not said when it will reach a final decision. "It puts all bitcoin businesses onto solid legal grounds and\nrecognizes bitcoin as a legitimate medium of payment," Tim\nRehder, chief executive of London-based bitcoin marketplace\nCubits, told Reuters. Sweden approached the court after David Hedqvist, a bitcoin\nweb-forum moderator, asked for a ruling on the issue in Sweden\nbecause he wanted to start selling the digital currency. "We\'re happy that the advocate general shares our assessment\nand we hope that the EU court will share it as well," Hedqvist\'s\nlawyer Fredrik Berndt told Reuters.

The twins, best known for accusing Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea, want to make the digital currency mainstream in the United States. Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Bitcoin is not backed by a government or central bank and its value fluctuates according to demand by users.  The Winklevoss brothers filed an application on July 21 with the New York State Department of Financial Services to operate as a trust company. ItBit also filed a trust application in New York in February. In May, it became the first virtual currency company to receive a charter in the state. A trust company is a type of financial institution technically different from a bank, according to a blog by Houman Shadab, an expert on bitcoin regulations and a professor at the New York Law School. Under New York state's banking law, a trust company has all the powers of a bank to take deposits and make loans, alongside certain fiduciary powers such as acting as an agent for governmental bodies, he wrote.  Examples of trust companies in New York include securities custodian the Depository Trust Company, the wealth and asset manager Northern Trust, and the Bank of New York Mellon. Last year Mt.

Strict regulation, easy access to credit due to rock-bottom interest rates, and weak demand for innovative financial services from a risk-averse population that still prefers cash to credit cards, have strangled fintech\'s advance in Japan. Fintech ventures - usually start-ups leveraging technology from cloud data storage to smartphones to provide loans, insurance and payment services - raised $2.7 billion in China last year, and over $1.5 billion in India, according to CB Insights data. Ventures in the United States attracted investment of around $7.4 billion.  In comparison, investment in Japanese ventures reached only around $44 million in the first nine months of 2015.     Now, Japan\'s financial industry regulator hopes relaxed rules on investing in financial ventures, and a new system for regulating virtual currency exchanges will pass through parliament by May - a first step in kickstarting the fintech revolution in the world\'s third-biggest economy. "The law changes aren\'t a goal, but a first step," Norio Sato, a senior official at the Financial Services Authority (FSA), told Reuters. "Fintech will have a big impact on financial services." The changes, which will allow banks to buy stakes of up to 100 percent in non-finance-related firms, will free up Japan\'s three megabanks to enter into tie-ups with fintech ventures developing services including robotic investment advisory and blockchain, the decentralized ledger technology behind the bitcoin digital currency. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have said they are eyeing such investments, having previously been restricted to holding stakes of only 5-15 percent in start-ups.  Under pressure from weak loan demand, the megabanks see an opportunity to earn money through fintech, but are also aware of its potential to disrupt traditional business models.  GAME CHANGER The unpromising fintech environment in Japan - which was blindsided by the high-profile collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange in 2014 when hackers stole an estimated $650 million worth of the digital currency - has seen some entrepreneurs go overseas for funding. Junichi Horiguchi, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin service provider Zerobillbank Ltd, established his start-up in Tel Aviv last year to take advantage of Israel\'s advanced technology industry. Investment in fintech start-ups by global banks and tech giants including Barclays, Google and Facebook is far more common in Israel than in Japan, he said. "It\'s completely different over there," Horiguchi told Reuters. "Every month there are open innovation contests and (start-up) accelerator program." Sales at Japan\'s fintech start-ups could jump to over half a billion dollars by 2020 as the use of technology such as blockchain increases, Yano Research Institute said in a report.

Gox, was arrested on Saturday in connection with the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the virtual currency, Japanese media reports said. The French-born Karpeles, 30, is suspected of falsifying data on the outstanding balance of the exchange, at one point the world's largest hub for trading the digital currency, they added. Police were unable to immediately confirm the reports. When it filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, Mt. Gox said 750,000 customer bitcoins and another 100,000 belonging to the exchange were stolen due to a software security flaw.  The lost funds represented the equivalent of $480 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing. Mt. Gox also said more than $27 million was missing from its Japanese bank accounts. Karpeles, who had blamed hackers for the loss, later said he had recovered 200,000 of the lost bitcoins. Known as a self-proclaimed geek who said he was uncomfortable in his native France and hadn't been back in years, Karpeles became interested in bitcoin when a customer of his web-hosting services wanted to pay in the virtual currency.  Mt. Gox subsequently shot from obscurity to dominate global trade in bitcoin, but as early as 2012 employees at the Tokyo-based exchange challenged Karpeles on issues such as whether client money was being used to cover costs.

Lawsky, who departed last month as superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, started his own firm to advise companies on regulation and other matters.  In his first public appearance since his transition, the outspoken former regulator was interviewed at a digital currency conference in Manhattan.  Marc Hochstein, editor-in-chief of the American Banker, asked Lawsky about the possible conflict of interest in his issuing regulations governing bitcoin on June 3. New York was the first state to do so.  "To clear the air," Hochstein asked, "what would you say to someone who would think that maybe you built yourself a revolving door?" Lawsky responded that he was not allowed to do any work before the department for two years, including behind-the-scenes work. He also said he is banned for life from working on any matter he worked on at the department. \u201cThe rules are very clear,\u201d Lawsky said. "If anyone... said \'I want to hire you to help get a BitLicense from DFS,\' no can do.\u201d\xa0  Still, Lawsky did not rule out taking on virtual currency clients.  Lawsky left the department on June 16, after four years of running the agency and overseeing landmark settlements with global banks accused of misconduct. He began to make a name for himself in 2012 when he threatened to revoke British bank Standard Chartered Plc\'s license to operate in New York over violations related to U.S. sanctions.  He registered The Lawsky Group in Delaware on June 17, according to the state\'s website. His new company\'s address is 27 East 62nd Street in Manhattan, according to the company website, a domain name registered in early May. However, the 62nd Street building is under construction, according to a spokeswoman for billionaire Ronald Perelman\u2019s MacAndrews & Forbes, which owns it. Lawsky told Reuters he would move into the building in the fall.  MacAndrews & Forbes\' general counsel Steve Cohen offered to loan Lawsky temporary space, a Perelman company spokeswoman said.  Cohen is a former top aide to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who chose Lawsky as superintendent. The pair also worked together under Cuomo when he was New York Attorney General.

The original "cryptocurrency", bitcoin is increasingly accepted as payment for goods and services over the Internet. But detractors are concerned about how bitcoin makes it easier for users to make purchases anonymously. Andresen acknowledged it has been used in the United States for online gambling, which was effectively outlawed there until December 2011, with banks barred from transmitting bets. It also played an important role in the function of the Silk Road online marketplace, which sold drugs and other illegal or contraband goods until it was closed in 2013. "Without those uses maybe it would have taken longer (for bitcoin to get to where it is)," he told Reuters over coffee at a conference organized by the Bitcoin Foundation in London, where a push into financial technology is making the city a hub for the virtual currency.. In its early days, "the Internet was for porn. That was the story," said Andresen, who graduated from Princeton with a degree in computer science in 1988 and took a job in a 3D graphics company in California\'s Silicon Valley. "If you look at a lot of technologies, they start in the shadows \u2013 in the grey areas, the black areas \u2013 and then eventually they become mainstream. I think bitcoin has seen the same evolution." Andresen took over the bitcoin empire in 2011 from Satoshi Nakamoto, an elusive figure credited with founding bitcoin in 2009. Some "bitcoiners" have suggested Andresen and "Satoshi", as he is widely known, are in fact the same person, and some have said Satoshi may in fact be a team of developers. Andresen denies he is Satoshi, and says he has never met him. "There are some questions I\'m sick of giving answers to. Don\'t ask me if I\'m Satoshi," Andresen said at the conference, which took place on the site of the old Royal Mint where Britain\'s coinage was produced for 200 years. Andresen said he was chosen via an email in which Satoshi said he was moving on and leaving Bitcoin "in the good hands of Gavin and everyone". He then changed the contact on the Bitcoin website from his email address to Andresen\'s.  Bitcoin has come a long way since 2010, when it was first used to make a payment -- 10,000 bitcoins for pizza. One bitcoin is currently worth around $220. Leading companies, including International Business Machines and governments, are showing growing interest in the technology that underlies it. The currency is not backed by any government or central bank and floats freely, fluctuating according to user demand. Like many bitcoiners, Andresen sees the lack of centralised oversight liberating users of the digital currency. "My\xa0vision is really to give people more control over their money in the financial world," he said. One advantage of bitcoin often cited is the ability to send money instantaneously and cheaply to other users anywhere in the world. All a user needs is an Internet connection, whether or not they have a bank account, credit card or even an address.  Andresen\'s ambition is for bitcoin to reach a billion people, with the developing world -- where many have smartphones but not bank accounts -- seen as ripe for greater use. "If the goal is just the 10,000 richest people in the world using bitcoin, frankly I\'m not interested."  Bitcoin\'s value has been highly volatile, having peaked at over $1,200 in late 2013 before crashing in the wake of a $500 million hacking attack on Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox in early 2014. \xa0\xa0\xa0 Such an attack could happen again, Andresen says, and warns against investing too much in bitcoin for now.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 "I hate hearing people who say they invested their life savings in bitcoin. Don\'t do that. And I have not done that personally," he said. "Bitcoin is an experiment."  \xa0\xa0\xa0 So how many bitcoins does bitcoin\'s chief architect have? Andresen preferred not to give that away.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 "Fewer than many people think," he said.

British authorities have come out in support of digital\ncurrencies in the name of promoting financial innovation, while\nproposing that regulations should be drawn up to prevent their\nuse in crime. But it is technophiles who are leading the drive to make\nLondon a real-world hub for trade in web-based\n"cryptocurrencies", of which bitcoin is the original and still\nmost popular. Every Tuesday evening in a trendy cafe in London\'s\nShoreditch neighbourhood, a group of digital currency\nenthusiasts gathers to discuss ideas, "vape" from e-cigarettes\nand exchange their pounds for bitcoins in a dedicated "ATM". With more than 2,200 members, CoinScrum, run by a former\nderivatives trader who left the world of traditional finance to\nwork on a digital currency start-up, is the biggest bitcoin\nnetworking group in the world. Its meetings draw a mostly young,\nmostly male crowd - some amateurs, others who have come to\nBritain to start bitcoin businesses. Already the capital of traditional currency trading, London\nis competing with San Francisco\'s web expertise and New York\'s\nfinancial clout as it pushes to be the foremost financial\ntechnology - or fintech - centre in the world. Last month the British government announced plans to\nregulate digital currency exchanges to prevent their use in\nmoney-laundering, and to help to develop a set of standards for\ncryptocurrencies. Backers of bitcoin praised this for lending legitimacy to\nthe currency - which unlike traditional money has no printed\nform and remains outside the control of central banks - without\nstifling innovation. "London has been the home of financial innovation for\nhundreds of years," said Nicolas Cary, co-founder of Blockchain,\nwhich provides bitcoin data and "wallet" software for storing\nthe currency. "It would be a historical mistake not to make this\nthe home of digital currencies. There\'s an incredible amount of\ntalent and experience here." Just over 14 million bitcoins are in circulation, worth \naround $3.1 billion at the current exchange rate of around $220\neach. Bitcoin brought 29-year-old Cary to Britain two years ago\nfrom Denver, Colorado. He joined forces with Ben Reeves, then a\n22-year-old computer science graduate, to develop the Blockchain\nwallet, spending the first year working out of a two-bedroom\napartment in northern England. Now Blockchain, named after the technology behind bitcoin,\nis the world\'s biggest wallet provider, with over 3 million\nusers. Last year it raised over $30 million in its first round\nof funding, including from billionaire Richard Branson.  POSITIVE ATTITUDE While some people argue that London lags New York overall as\nthe centre for traditional finance, many say the latter\'s\nattitude to digital currencies - including a state plan to\nimpose a "BitLicense" on bitcoin start-ups - makes London more\nattractive for the growing number of businesses dealing in the\nbudding technology.

Detractors worry that digital currencies make it easy for\nusers to buy products anonymously from websites like Silk Road,\nan underground marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods\nwhich was shut down in 2013.

Asked about bitcoin, the governing body for the City of\nLondon financial district said authorities needed to be "alive\nto the potential risks and take strong action if they find\nevidence of abuse or criminal activities". But the employment\nand growth opportunities offered by the fintech in general were\nto be welcomed, it said. Britain made bitcoin trading exempt from value-added tax\nlast year. Other countries have yet to decide how to tax\nbitcoin, since its independence from any central bank means it\ndoes not fall into the traditional definition of money. However, Australia has made bitcoin transactions subject to\ngoods and services tax. That helped to drive CoinJar, an\nAustralian company that allows users to buy, sell and spend\nbitcoins, to move its headquarters to London last December.

Carl Force, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent, admitted to charges of extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice. In a San Francisco federal court, Force appeared in an orange jump suit and leg shackles and acknowledged a litany of criminal acts. Among them, Force said he agreed to a contract with Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) last year to help make a movie about the Silk Road investigation, without the permission of his supervisors. That deal called for him to be paid up to $240,000. Representatives for Twenty-First Century Fox could not immediately be reached for comment. U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg accepted Force\'s plea and scheduled sentencing in October. Silk Road operated for more than two years until it was shut down in October 2013, generating more than $214 million in sales of drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoins, prosecutors said. Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road\'s creator who authorities say used the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts," was sentenced to life in prison in May after a federal jury in Manhattan found him guilty of several charges, including distributing drugs through the Internet. Prosecutors also reached a plea agreement with Shaun Bridges, a former Secret Service agent who was charged along with Force in March with stealing bitcoins, the web-based digital currency, during the investigation. An attorney for Ulbricht has said those charges "removes any question about the corruption that pervaded the investigation of Silk Road." Force and Bridges belonged to a Baltimore-based federal task force that investigated Silk Road. Force played a prominent role, communicating with Ulbricht while posing as a drug dealer named "Nob," prosecutors said. According to a government document, Force, operating as "Nob," in August 2013 convinced Ulbricht to pay him $50,000 in bitcoins by pretending he had information on the investigation. While Force reported the discussion to the DEA, he falsely claimed no payment had been made but instead diverted the bitcoins to a personal account, prosecutors said. Force, also without authorities\' knowledge, used another online moniker, "French Maid," and offered Ulbricht information on the investigation for about $98,000 in bitcoins in September 2013, prosecutors said.

Alongside the new regulation and standards, the British government promised an additional 10 million pounds ($15 million) for a research initiative that will look into the blockchain technology behind digital currencies.\xa0 It is the blockchain - essentially a ledger of every bitcoin transaction that is virtually impossible to tamper with - that the Bank of England has also said could be revolutionary. Central banks, it has said, could eventually issue digital currencies of their own.\xa0 Dozens of others have copied this technology to set up their own digital currencies, though none has so far managed to knock bitcoin off the top spot.   TANTRIC MASSAGE Londoners can change cash for bitcoins at seven ATMs in the capital, and use them to pay for anything from tantric massage to a designer dress, a pork chop to a pint of beer. One company even allows rent on property to be paid in bitcoin.\xa0 Back in the trendy "Vape Lab" e-cigarette cafe, one young bitcoiner was putting 800 pounds\' worth of 20 pound notes into a bitcoin ATM in exchange for the digital currency.\xa0 "I just sell bitcoin to others, because they don\'t know how to do it, so I take advantage of that and I make a profit," he said.\xa0  ($1 = 0.6774 pounds)   (editing by David Stamp)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Jemima Kelly'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0N622320150415', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 4, 15, 13, 17), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'London stakes its claim as global bitcoin hub'}, {'articleText': u' A former federal agent has agreed to plead\nguilty to stealing bitcoins during the government\'s\ninvestigation of Silk Road and secretly soliciting payment from\nthe operator of the online black market for information on its\nprobe. Carl Force, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\nagent, has agreed to plead guilty on July 1 to charges of\nextortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice,\naccording to papers filed on Monday in federal court in San\nFrancisco. The deal came after prosecutors last week reached a plea\nagreement with Shaun Bridges, a former Secret Service agent who\nwas charged along with Force in March with stealing bitcoins,\nthe web-based digital currency, during the\ninvestigation. Neither Force\'s lawyer nor a spokesman for the U.S.\nAttorney\'s Office in San Francisco responded to requests for\ncomment. Silk Road operated for more than two years until it was shut\ndown in October 2013, generating more than $214 million in sales\nof drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoins, prosecutors\nsaid. Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road\'s creator who authorities say used\nthe alias "Dread Pirate Roberts," was sentenced to life in\nprison in May after a federal jury in Manhattan found him guilty\nof several charges, including distributing drugs through the\nInternet. Force and Bridges belonged to a Baltimore-based federal task\nforce that investigated Silk Road. Force played a prominent\nrole, communicating with Ulbricht while posing as a drug dealer\nnamed "Nob," prosecutors said. According to a government document, Force, operating as\n"Nob," in August 2013 convinced Ulbricht to pay him $50,000 in\nbitcoins by pretending he had information on the investigation. While Force reported the discussion to the DEA, he falsely\nclaimed no payment had been made but instead diverted the\nbitcoins to a personal account, prosecutors said. Force, also without authorities\' knowledge, used another\nonline moniker, "French Maid," and offered Ulbricht information\non the investigation for about $98,000 in bitcoins in September\n2013, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said that while working as a DEA agent, Force\nordered that a customer\'s account be frozen in a digital\ncurrency exchange company in which he had invested. But the $297,000 in bitcoins in the account was never\ndeposited in a DEA account, prosecutors said, and instead was\ntransferred in April 2014 by Force into a personal account. Prosecutors have said Bridges, the former Secret Service\nagent, meanwhile diverted over $800,000 in bitcoins to a\npersonal account. The case is U.S. v.

The exchange can begin operating immediately, but will be\nrequired to meet the obligations for a trust company under New\nYork law, as well as upcoming "BitLicense" regulations, the\nstate agency said. New York\'s Department of Financial Services is expected to\nissue regulations for bitcoin and other virtual currency\nbusinesses later this month. In a statement, itBit said would immediately begin accepting\nU.S. customers. The company also said it has partnered with an FDIC-insured\nand regulated bank to assure U.S. clients that their money is \nheld in the United States and with FDIC-insurance, which covers\n$250,000 per account. ItBit said it had raised $25 million in financing. The Department of Financial Services issued a March 2014\norder initiating a process for accepting licensing applications\nfor virtual currency exchanges under the New York banking law. The order came after the failure of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based\nexchange that filed for bankruptcy in Japan and the United\nStates after losing an estimated 850,000 in customer bitcoins,\nor about $560 million. The regulator said itBit applied for its charter in February\n2015, and after a review of its anti-money laundering,\ncapitalization, consumer protection and cyber security\nstandards, the charter was granted. The regulator plans to issue "Bitlicense" regulations later\nthis month. "We have sought to move quickly but carefully to put in\nplace rules of the road to protect consumers and provide greater\nregulatory certainty for virtual currency entrepreneurs," DFS\nSuperintendent Benjamin Lawsky said in a statement. Reuters reported last month that itBit, whose exchange\noperates in Singapore, had filed for the banking license after\nmoving its primary headquarters to New York last year.

Paul was in his home state of Kentucky on Tuesday to launch his 2016 White House bid. His campaign website, Stand With Rand, went live to coincide with the launch. The website\'s donation page reminds individuals that they are allowed to contribute up to $2,700 per election cycle and gives them the option of using a credit card, the online service PayPal or bitcoin. The move to allow bitcoin donations reflects the Kentucky senator\'s tendency to embrace new technology, his courting of Silicon Valley donors and outreach to younger voters, which would be a core constituency of a successful Paul campaign. "Our campaign will be the most technologically savvy campaign. We\'ll engage across all platforms, from Snapchat to bitcoin," Paul spokesman Sergio Gor said in an email. Paul, a libertarian, supports a flat income tax, cutting government spending to balance the budget, lessening the authority of the Federal Reserve and preserving personal liberties. His campaign slogan is: "Defeat the Washington Machine." Bitcoin users favor the digital currency due to low transaction costs and instantaneous transfer. The U.S. Treasury categorizes bitcoin as a decentralized, virtual currency. Britain announced last month that it would begin regulating digital currencies such as bitcoin for the first time.

The objective is to allow people to transfer cash or make payments instantaneously using this technology without a bank or clearing party involved, saving on transaction costs, the person said. The transactions would be in an open ledger of a specific country\'s currency such as the dollar or euro, said the source,  who declined to be identified because of a lack of authorization to discuss the project in public. The blockchain - a ledger, or list, of all of a digital currency\'s transactions - is viewed as bitcoin\'s main technological innovation, allowing users to make payments anonymously, instantly, and without government regulation.  Rather than stored on a separate server and controlled by an individual, company, or bank, the ledger is open and accessible to all participants in the bitcoin network.  The proposed digital currency system would work in a similar way. "When somebody wants to transact in the system, instead of you trying to acquire a bitcoin, you simply say, here are some U.S. dollars," the source said. "It\'s sort of a bitcoin but without the bitcoin." IBM is one of a number of tech companies looking to expand the use of the blockchain technology beyond bitcoin, the digital currency launched six years ago that has spurred a following among investors and tech enthusiasts. The company has been in informal discussions about a blockchain-tied cash system with a number of central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the source said. If central banks approve the concept, IBM will build the secure and scalable infrastructure for the project. IBM media relations office did not respond to Reuters emails about this story and the Fed declined to comment.  However, there are signs that central banks are already thinking about the innovations that could arise through digital currency systems. The Bank of England, in a report in September 2014, described the blockchain\'s open ledger as a "significant innovation" that could transform the financial system more generally.  Instead of having ledgers maintained by banks that act as a record of an individual\'s transactions, this kind of open ledger would be viewable by everyone using the system, and would use an agreed-upon process for entering transactions into the system. The project is still in the early stages and constantly evolving, the source said. It is also unclear how concerns about money-laundering and criminal activities that have hamstrung bitcoin.  Unlike bitcoin, where the network is decentralized and there is no overseer, the proposed digital currency system would be controlled by central banks, the source said.  "These coins will be part of the money supply," the source said. "It\'s the same money, just not a dollar bill with a serial number on it, but a token that sits on this blockchain." According to the plans, the digital currency could be linked to a person\'s bank account, possibly using a wallet software that would integrate that account with the proposed digital currency ledger.  "We are at a tipping point right now. It\'s making a lot more sense for some type of digital cash in the system, that not only saves our government money, but also is a lot more convenient and secure for individuals to use," the source said.

Carl Force, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent, and Shaun Bridges, a special agent with the Secret Service, were charged in a criminal complaint filed in San Francisco federal court with offenses including wire fraud and money laundering. Silk Road was an underground website where people bought drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoin digital currency. By the time authorities shut it down in October 2013, Silk Road had generated around $200 million in sales, prosecutors said. Authorities said it was operated by Ross Ulbricht, 30, under the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts." A federal jury in Manhattan found Ulbricht guilty in February of charges including conspiracy to commit drug trafficking and money laundering. Force, 46, and Bridges, 32, belonged to a Baltimore-based federal task force investigating the Silk Road. Force had a prominent role in the probe, authorities said, as he was the lead undercover agent in communication with Ulbricht. But prosecutors said while Force spoke with Ulbricht using an officially sanctioned alias, he also created unauthorized online personas to communicate with "Dread Pirate Roberts." Using those aliases, Force extorted $250,000 from Ulbricht and later offered to sell him information about the government\'s investigation for $100,000, the complaint said. Prosecutors said Force also stole $90,000 worth of bitcoins that Ulbricht paid him in under an officially sanctioned alias used for the undercover investigation. Authorities said Bridges, 32, meanwhile diverted to his personal account over $800,000 worth of bitcoin that he controlled during the Silk Road investigation. Force was arrested in Baltimore on Friday and appeared in court there on Monday. Bridges surrendered on Monday and was released after appearing in court in San Francisco.

Adds 3rd paragraph to include the name of the bitcoin exchange) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Jessica Toonkel HOLLYWOOD, Fla. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, two of the leading advocates of bitcoin, expect to get regulatory approval to launch a U.S. exchange for investors to buy and sell the virtual currency in the first quarter, the twins told Reuters on Monday. \xa0 \xa0 "The information coming\xa0 out of the DFS (Department of Financial Services) is that Q1 is their goal. And we will be ready by then,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss, a principal at New York-based Winklevoss Capital, said in an interview at ETF.com\'s Inside ETFs Conference in Hollywood, Florida. The bitcoin exchange will be called Gemini, the brothers said. In a blog on its website,\xa0gemini.com, the Winklevoss twins said they have been putting together the Gemini team since last February. \xa0 \xa0 Any firm seeking to launch a financial exchange needs the approval of the state it wants to operate in.  On Monday, Coinbase Inc launched the first regulated U.S. exchange for bitcoin.  The twins want to launch a regulated U.S. exchange because so many bitcoin exchanges are offshore and unregulated. "With a bitcoin exchange you have to build it like you are a real financial institution," said Tyler Winklevoss.   The Winklevoss twins are creating the exchange while they seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The agency has been reviewing their filing since 2013. The twins anticipate that institutional investors, like mutual funds and pension plans, will be interested in a bitcoin ETF since they are not permitted to buy the currency itself. They also believe mom and pop investors who do not want to  store a large amount of bitcoin would be interested in the ETF.  "Most bitcoin losses have not been due to theft or hacking," Tyler Winklevoss said. "It has been due to user error. It is people forgetting their passwords or losing their keys." Still the twins noted that security is a big issue for bitcoin, as a few exchanges have been hacked over the years.  Some of the firm\'s first hires for its exchange were security professionals. And they insist that security at exchanges has gotten much better over time. \xa0 \xa0 \u201cSecurity shouldn\u2019t be with this guy in the back office,\u201d said Cameron Winklevoss. \u201cHe should be the most important person in the organization.\u201d\xa0 Despite bitcoin\'s huge drop since its high of $1,163 in December 2013, the Winklevoss brothers still think the currency will hit $40,000 per unit in the future. \xa0 \xa0 On Monday, bitcoin traded at $274.39, up 7.47 percent on the day.

Melbourne-based start-up Bitcoin Group told Reuters in December it hoped to raise A$20 million ($15.6 million) on the Australian Stock Exchange and has been seeking expressions of interest from potential investors from the Chinese community through Wechat, China\'s hugely popular instant messaging service. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said on Friday it was prohibiting Bitcoin Group from making any further statements about its planned listing until it had filed a prospectus. While globally there are at least two other publicly traded bitcoin companies following "backdoor listings", Bitcoin Group would be the first to offer shares in an IPO. "The publications were made before Bitcoin Group Ltd was registered as an Australian company by ASIC and before the lodgement of a formal disclosure document (e.g. a prospectus)," ASIC said in a statement. "ASIC expects companies to be fully aware of their obligations regarding advertising or publicity that occurs before making a regulated disclosure document available to investors."  ASIC said the actions related to Bitcoin Group specifically and not to bitcoin generally, but the move will increase scrutiny on the controversial new virtual currency. Bitcoins are created through a "mining" process that uses a computer\'s resources to perform millions of calculations. Advocates say bitcoin is revolutionary as it is not controlled by a central bank, but its rising popularity has stoked concern it can be used as a vehicle to launder money and finance militant groups. Earlier this week, Hong Kong lawmakers urged authorities to ban bitcoin as a group of more than 25 people went to police headquarters to complain over dealings involving the digital currency that media estimate could have duped investors of up to $387 million.

Figures obtained by Reuters show that while "wallets" - cyberspeak for accounts - are being created at a steady clip, many of them are empty. Analysts also provided Reuters with data that shows liquidity in the cryptocurrency remains limited.  Bitcoin, a virtual currency created through a "mining"  process where a computer\'s resources are used to perform millions of calculations, has been hailed as revolutionary because of its lack of ties to a central bank and its potential as an alternative to credit cards for paying goods and services. However, the currency\'s volatility has slowed broader acceptance. The price of bitcoin has plummeted roughly 50 percent so far this year. It most recently traded at $356.26, down from a peak of $1,163 in December 2013. Two of its primary appeals -- the lower transaction fees compared to credit cards and its use in cross-border transactions -- have not been enough to offset its ups and downs.  Until a unique application emerges that separates it from credit cards, online payments or other currencies, the expansion may remain slow, many market insiders said. "There has to be some motivation that would help this whole bitcoin system explode, like really good applications for consumers," said Jonathan Levin, a London-based digital currency consultant and co-founder of the Oxford Virtual Currency Group. "At the moment, there isn\'t."  Last week\'s second auction of bitcoins by the U.S. Marshals Service, which showed a drastic drop in bidders from the first sale in June, demonstrated just how far bitcoin has fallen off the radar. The first auction attracted 45 unique bidders, with 63 bids, while the December sale showed just 11 buyers and 27 bids.  Despite declining demand, billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper, one of the most ardent supporters of the digital currency, believes bitcoin is still one of the "greatest technological breakthroughs since the Internet."   He is betting that bitcoin will be widely accepted by consumers who want to make secure purchases without costly bank or credit card fees. Many applications are still being developed by start-up companies that will affect the way consumers operate, said Draper, who was the sole winner of the first U.S. Marshals\' bitcoin auction and also took a portion of last week\'s sale.  MORE RETAILERS ACCEPTING BITCOINS, BUT... The number of online merchants, including Overstock.com and Dell  which accept bitcoin as payment jumped to 76,000 at the end of September from just 10,000 a year ago, according to digital currency news website Coindesk.  Still, actual retail sales using bitcoin remain paltry. The only figures on retail sales in bitcoin are estimates and Tim Swanson, head of business development at Melotic, a Hong Kong-based exchange for digital assets, told Reuters global retail sales in bitcoin come to about $2.3 million daily (5,000-6,000 bitcoins). By comparison, consumers spend about $15 billion daily in the United States.  The vast majority of bitcoins are also immediately converted into traditional currencies like dollars and euros when handled in retail transactions. Fees for this typically run at about 1 percent or less. Bitpay, one of the two biggest bitcoin payment processors, is doing about $1 million in transactions per day, Stephanie Wargo, BitPay\'s vice president of marketing said. Coinbase, the other big payment processor, declined to disclose retail transaction volumes. One development many bitcoin supporters hope could change this is the Atlas bitcoin card, the first bitcoin U.S. debit card for buying goods and services and a business backed by venture capitalist Draper.  But Atlas still has to run the gauntlet of regulatory approvals before the card hits the market, the company\'s co-founder, Mickey Costa said. He declined to elaborate. Draper said Atlas could eventually save retailers the 2-1/2 to 4 percent fee they pay credit card companies.   WHAT\'S IN YOUR WALLET Just like retailer acceptance of bitcoin, the creation of wallets - which store secure digital keys used to access bitcoin addresses and sign transactions - has also surged.    At the end of the third quarter, the latest figures available, wallets grew to 6.5 million from 1.3 million a year earlier, according to Coindesk.  However, opening a wallet is cost-free, and of the 6.5 million wallets, only about 250,000 to 500,000 have actual bitcoins in them while the rest are empty, Melotic\'s Swanson said.  For Brian Armstrong, chief executive officer at Coinbase in San Francisco, a better measure of consumer adoption is daily transaction volume, which crossed 100,000 in December for the first time, according to Blockchain.info, a wallet company. But the bulk of that transaction volume has nothing to do with the actual buying of goods and services: activities such as  miners moving bitcoins between wallets, said Jeffrey Robinson, who has written a book on bitcoin. Bitcoin liquidity has also remained constrained.  John Ratcliff, a software engineer at Nvidia who has done extensive analysis on bitcoin transactions, estimated that monthly liquidity is about 10-20 percent of the entire 13.6 million bitcoin in circulation. The rest are either being hoarded or don\'t trade because they\'re fractional in size. Where bitcoin could be valuable though is remittances across borders, especially in emerging markets, where transaction costs can be very expensive, said Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at CitiFX in New York. "But in the end, you want to ask yourself, does bitcoin hold promise of making certain transactions efficient? The answer is yes," said Englander. "Does it cater to any market niche that is not already being taken care of? I am more skeptical."

The South China Morning Post reported on Monday that clients\nof Hong Kong-based MyCoin had approached a local lawmaker\nalleging the company absconded with their money. An assistant\nfor Legislative Council member Leung Yiu-chung told Reuters that\nLeung had received more than 15 complaints from MyCoin clients\nregarding the alleged fraud, and these would be passed on to the\npolice on Wednesday. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said in a statement\nlate on Monday that the case "may involve fraud or pyramid\nschemes," adding: "Given the highly speculative nature of\nBitcoin, we have all along urged the public to exercise extra\ncaution when considering making transactions or investments with\nBitcoin."

MyCoin promised clients a HK$1 million ($128,976) return\nover a 4-month period based on a HK$400,000 investment that\nwould produce 90 bitcoins on maturity, the South China Morning\nPost reported, adding MyCoin claimed to have 3,000 customers\neach investing an average of HK$1 million.

The government had 14 registered bidders for the 34 bids received, said  Marshals Service spokeswoman Lynzey Donahue. That was higher than the bids received at the last bitcoin auction in December, when just 11 buyers submitted 27 bids. The first auction in June attracted 45 bidders and 63 bids. Donahue expects the auction process to be finished on Monday, at the earliest, when the financial transactions have been completed and the bitcoins transferred to the winning bidders. The winners though are expected to be notified on Friday. The bitcoins on the auction block are valued at $13.9 million at current prices. The six-hour online auction began at 8 a.m. EST (1300 GMT). The 50,000 bitcoins were offered in 20 blocks: 10 blocks of 2,000 bitcoins and 10 blocks of 3,000 bitcoins.  The Marshals Service conducted auctions in June and December for nearly 80,000 bitcoins seized during the 2013 raid of Silk Road, a website on which authorities say drugs and other illegal goods could be bought. Ulbricht, 30, was found guilty on Feb. 4 of conspiracies to commit money laundering, computer hacking and drug trafficking. SecondMarket, owned and founded by Barry Silbert, won the bidding for 48,000 bitcoins auctioned in December. Silbert said that SecondMarket would participate in Thursday\'s  auction, but his firm has not created a syndicate for the sale. Pantera Capital, an investment fund founded by Dan Morehead, a former senior executive at hedge fund Tiger Management, said in its newsletter it is also participating and has formed a syndicate for the auction. Meanwhile, billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper, winner of the past two auctions, did not submit a bid. But he said in an email that the bitcoins on the auction block are "probably...the best deal anyone will get." Draper won part of the bitcoin auction in December, successfully bidding on one lot, totaling 2,000 bitcoins, on behalf of Draper Associates. He planned to invest 300 bitcoins in every startup that participated in the current session of Boost, a program for bitcoin-related startups founded by his son, Adam Draper. Tim Draper was the sole winner of the first auction of 29,655 bitcoins. In late trading, bitcoin prices were up 2.3 percent at $277.

The UK-based company is known for its Elliptic Vault product, a so-called deep cold storage service which allows bitcoin holders to store holdings of the digital currency in secure locations offline to shield them from hackers. "KPMG\'s accreditation is an important milestone," James Smith, Elliptic\'s chief executive officer, said in a statement on Monday. "(It) demonstrates to our customers that we have the rigorous internal processes and controls expected of any traditional financial services provider," he said. The accreditation, known formally as the ISAE 3402 Type 1 review, comes after a number of scandals involving bitcoins spooked potential enthusiasts of the digital currency. Last week, Bitstamp, one of the largest exchanges for bitcoin trading, said it had suspended its service after a security breach, resulting in the loss of about 19,000 bitcoins.  In February last year, Mt. Gox, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchanges, lost 750,000 bitcoins held by its users and 100,000 of its own due to hacking.  According to the bitcoin price at the time, the Mt. Gox losses come to about $480 million, or 7 percent of the world\'s estimated total. Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, started circulating in 2009. Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers and is independent of control or backing by any government. A bitcoin is worth $271.77. Elliptic became the first Bitcoin firm to offer an insured storage service in January 2014, which was taken at the time as a sign the bitcoin industry was maturing.

The leading crypto-currency\'s\neconomies of scale in mining and its transaction system\'s\nvulnerability to subversion by a dominant miner make it unsound.\nAs seignorage declines it will become cost-uncompetitive for\ntransactions. These flaws will cause its price to lose further\naltitude. The digital currency is controlled not by a state but by an\nunderlying algorithm by which participants can "mine" bitcoins\nthrough solving mathematical problems. The universe of miners\ncan then validate "blockchains" of bitcoin transactions by\nmajority vote, weighted by their mining effort. As a reward,\nminers receive more bitcoins, distributed randomly. By combining their activities, the currency\'s creators can\nincrease their probability of receiving a bitcoin, which can be\nshared between them. Assuming miners are risk-averse, the system\nslants toward monopoly. This theoretical tendency is validated\nby the current bitcoin setup, in which a single mine, GHash.IO,\nwhich pools the interests of individual participants, currently\ncontrols about 39 percent of mining activity, according to\nBlockchain.com. If a miner came to control more than half of bitcoin\ncreation, it could choose which blockchains to validate; the\nparticipants would then depend upon its integrity, no\ndifferently than they depend on trust in a government in a fiat\nmoney system. Over time, the rate of bitcoin production declines and the\namount of "work" required to produce one increases. By early\nOctober, 2014, the "hash rate" per bitcoin had increased 60\nbillion-fold since January 2010. Moore\'s Law, defining the\nincreasing power of processors, counteracts this but not\nsufficiently; a July 2014 study by Australian researcher Hass\nMcCook calculated that the cost of bitcoin production including\nequipment was about $600 per coin and the marginal cost of power\nwas about $57 per coin. These figures compare with the current\nbitcoin price of around $325, suggesting that capacity will\ndecline over time unless the price rises sharply. If mining bitcoins is profitable, big miners can use this\nseignorage to subsidize transaction fees. Once mining profits\ndisappear, transaction fees must subsidize mining, since only\nactive miners can validate transactions. This makes bitcoin\nuncompetitive with other electronic transaction systems in the\nlong term. Bitcoin\'s flaws are becoming more evident, which may explain\nwhy prices more than halved in 2014. That trend should continue.  CONTEXT NEWS - Bitcoin was trading around $325 on Dec. 26, down from a\npeak price of $1,151 in December 2013.\n\n (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

His sentence came a year after prosecutors unveiled charges\nagainst Faiella and his co-defendant, prominent bitcoin\nevangelist Charlie Shrem. His sentencing came as trial continued for Ross Ulbricht,\nthe alleged operator of Silk Road, a website where drugs and\nother illicit goods could be bought secretly with\nbitcoin. Rakoff in December sentenced Shrem, the former vice chairman\nat the trade group Bitcoin Foundation, to two years in prison\nfor aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitting\nbusiness.

Merlak, 28, and his colleague Nejc Kodric, 25, both computer experts, founded Bitstamp in 2011. According to the Slovenian media the two had earned about 23 million euros  ($27.2 million) from the enterprise which places them among the 50 richest Slovenians.

"We want to be there from the beginning." Expedia started accepting bitcoin payments for hotel bookings on July 11. \xa0\xa0\xa0 Until recently a niche alternative currency touted by a fervent group of followers, bitcoin has evolved into a software-based payment online system. Bitcoins are stored in a wallet with a unique identification number and companies like Coinbase and Blockchain can hold the currency for the user. \xa0\xa0\xa0 When buying an item from a merchant\'s website, a customer simply clicks on the bitcoin option and a pop-in window appears where he can type in his wallet ID number.   Still, broad-based adoption of bitcoin is at least five years away because most consumers still prefer to use credit cards, analysts said. \xa0\xa0\xa0 "Bitcoin is a new way of making payments, but it\'s not solving a problem that\'s broken," said George Peabody, payments consultant at Glenbrook Partners in Menlo Park, California. "Retail payments aren\'t broken." \xa0\xa0\xa0 There are also worries about bitcoin\'s volatility: its price in U.S. dollars changes every day. On Wednesday,\xa0bitcoin was up 0.4 percent at $514.09. \xa0\xa0\xa0 That risk is borne by the consumer and the bitcoin payment processor, such as Coinbase or Bitpay, not the retailer. The vendor doesn\'t hold the bitcoin and is paid in U.S. dollars. As soon as a customer pays in bitcoin, the digital currency goes to the payment processor and the processor immediately pays the merchant, for a fee of less than 1 percent. \xa0\xa0\xa0 "We don\'t have to deal with the actual holding of the bitcoin: it\'s the payment processor that takes the currency risk for us," said Bernie Han, chief operating officer at Dish Network Corp, in Englewood, Colorado. "That\'s what makes it appealing for us and I guess for other merchants as well." Dish, with about $14 billion in annual revenue, started accepting bitcoins in mid-August. \xa0\xa0\xa0 Payment processors do some form of hedging though, said Gil Luria, a financial technology analyst at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. These entities would, for instance, sell bitcoins in the market to offset the ones they have processed and in their books, so they\'re not left with much exposure, Luria said. \xa0\xa0\xa0 The only risk for the retailer is if the counterparty, or payment processor, doesn\'t fulfill its obligation. That risk is minimal, Luria said, \xa0\xa0\xa0 "Coinbase and Bitpay are now well-funded start-ups and they have put a lot of resources behind security," Luria said. "You can consider them as secure counterparties, as opposed to a year ago, when they were very small."  \xa0\xa0\xa0 ADDING TO EARNINGS \xa0\xa0\xa0 For some, it has become a beneficial situation for retailers, as they take advantage of lower transaction fees and sales from new customers. In at least one instance, bitcoin sales are expected to pad a company\'s bottom line, adding 4 cents a share to 2014 earnings at Salt Lake City-based online merchant Overstock.com, said chief executive officer Patrick Byrne. \xa0\xa0\xa0 Overstock was the first U.S. company with annual sales of at least $1 billion to accept bitcoins. Soon after, other companies including computer maker Dell Inc, Dish, and Newegg Inc, an online retailer of computer hardware and software, began to accept payments in bitcoin. \xa0\xa0\xa0 To date, there are about 63,000 merchants globally accepting bitcoin, estimates from data provider CoinDesk show. It forecasts that figure to rise to 100,000 by year-end. \xa0\xa0\xa0 Overstock\'s Byrne estimated bitcoin sales of between $6 million and $8 million by the end of 2014, a fraction of the company\'s total revenue. More importantly for Byrne, the bulk of bitcoin sales comes from new customers, who would otherwise not shop at Overstock if the website didn\'t offer bitcoin payments. Bitcoin owners tend to be high net-worth individuals and tech-savvy consumers.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In a way, bitcoin has been used by retailers as a marketing strategy to bring some much-needed buzz to brands that may be struggling.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 "Every retailer knows that if they make some sort of announcement on bitcoin these days, they know it\'s going be picked up more broadly by the media, than if they decided to accept Discover cards," said Glenbrook\'s Peabody. \xa0\xa0\xa0 One disadvantage from a consumer\'s point of view is that, in general, Bitcoin sales are final and irreversible. Still, there are some vendors that do return bitcoin payments for faulty products, said Adam White, director of business development and strategy at Coinbase, an online wallet company in San Francisco. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0SAVING ON TRANSACTION COSTS \xa0\xa0\xa0 For retailers, the biggest benefit in accepting bitcoins is lower transaction costs. Coinbase and Bitpay, for instance, charge less than 1 percent per transaction. A credit card payment, in contrast, typically carries a 3 percent fee. \xa0\xa0\xa0 Dell, which started accepting bitcoins in July, Dish, and Expedia all say their bitcoin revenue so far have exceeded their expectations. The three companies declined to give specific figures, but said bitcoin sales are modest relative to their overall revenues. \xa0\xa0\xa0 "From the first day...we saw traffic at the site, it has been growing since," said Paul Walsh, chief information officer at Dell Commerce Services in Texas. He cited a recent single purchase in bitcoins of a server worth more than $50,000. \xa0\xa0\xa0 At online travel agent Cheapair.com in Calabasas, California, bitcoin sales totaled $1.5 million so far since it started accepting them in November 2013, said CEO Jeff Klee. In July alone, bitcoin sales at the company jumped 20 percent. \xa0\xa0\xa0 Data from BlockChain.info, a bitcoin wallet which stores the digital currency for customers, showed that over the last three months, there were between 50,000 and 75,000 bitcoin transactions a day on average, worth between $45 million and $85 million. That compares with U.S. retail sales of about $15 billion a day during July, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. \xa0\xa0\xa0 As of the end of June, bitcoin wallets, representing the number of users who have bitcoin accounts, have grown to 5.32 million,\xa0from 765,039 users a year ago, CoinDesk data show. It predicted that wallets would increase to 8 million by year-end. \xa0\xa0\xa0 "I don\'t see too much risk for us right now on bitcoin," said Dish\'s Han. "We are not expecting bitcoin to revolutionize the way our customers handle their accounts, but based on what we have seen so far, there is no reason for us to change."

Jury selection is scheduled for Tuesday in Manhattan federal\ncourt in the case of Ross Ulbricht, who authorities say created\nSilk Road, an online black market where drugs and others illegal\ngoods could be bought anonymously using bitcoins. The trial, expected to run for up to six weeks, will cast a\nspotlight on the dark side of virtual currencies and so-called\nDarknet markets where illicit goods can be secretly bought. Ulbricht, 30, has never conceded creating Silk Road and has\npleaded not guilty to seven counts including operating a\ncontinuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy to commit\nnarcotics trafficking. Prosecutors say Ulbricht took extreme steps to protect Silk\nRoad, soliciting the murder of six people who posed a threat. No\nevidence exists the murders were carried out. The former Eagle Scout faces up to life in prison if\nconvicted. His supporters include bitcoin enthusiasts and\nlibertarians, who call the case an attack on Internet freedom. "It\'s not just about one man and one family, but it\'s\nsomething that will impact law going into the 21st Century," Lyn\nUlbricht, his mother, told a libertarian gathering in June. Joshua Dratel, his lawyer, declined comment.  \'ECONOMIC SIMULATION\' Silk Road operated from at least January 2011 to October\n2013, authorities say, generating sales of $1.2 billion and\ncommissions of $80 million by the time the FBI seized it and\narrested Ulbricht. Prosecutors say Ulbricht ran it as the "Dread Pirate\nRoberts," an alias borrowed from a character in the 1987 movie\n"The Princess Bride." The website relied on the so-called Tor\nnetwork, which lets users communicate anonymously. The website was created after Ulbricht, a Texas native with\na bachelor\'s degree in physics, left graduate studies at the\nPennsylvania State University in 2010. On LinkedIn, Ulbricht wrote that his goals had "shifted" and\nhe was now "creating an economic simulation to give people a\nfirst-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a\nworld without the systemic use of force." Prosecutors say the "economic simulation" was Silk Road,\nwhich made him rich: From his laptop, the government seized\n144,336 bitcoins that on Friday were worth $41.2 million. While Ulbricht was charged in a separate case in Maryland\nover an alleged murder-for-hire plot, the New York indictment\ndoes not have substantive charges regarding them. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, who is presiding over\nthe case in Manhattan court, has said she will allow prosecutors\nto present evidence on allegations Ulbricht ordered killings to\ndefend his business.  NEW MARKETS While Silk Road\'s takedown marked a high point in efforts to\ndisrupt illegal Darknet market activity, law enforcement\ncontinues to wrestle with it. Similar websites have since emerged, and by December they\nhad 78 percent more drug listings since Silk Road\'s seizure,\naccording to Internet safety nonprofit Digital Citizens\nAlliance. Among the new websites was one under Silk Road\'s name,\nleading to charges in November against alleged creator Blake\nBenthall amid a broader U.S. and European seizure of dozens of\nwebsites. Even then, the bust did not shutter larger websites like\nEvolution, which unlike Silk Road also sells weapons and stolen\ncredit cards, the Digital Citizens Alliance says. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office is\nprosecuting Ulbricht, compared it to "a game of Whac-A-Mole" but\nsaid that did not mean giving up. "The best way to go about it is to keep at it," he said.\n"Ultimately you have the deterrent effect, because people\nrealize, \'We can\'t change our ops enough not to get caught.\'"\n\n (Additional reporting by Aruna Viswanatha in Washington)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Nate Raymond'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0UR0NM20150112', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 12, 7, 34), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Accused Silk Road creator goes to trial amid U.S. scrutiny of bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u' TOKYO U.S. bitcoin exchange operator Payward Inc said on Wednesday it will work on retrieving some millions of dollars lost by Tokyo-based Mt.

Gox\'s Tokyo-court appointed trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi with investigating where the missing bitcoins are, along with eventually redistributing any found to creditors as part of a liquidation. The partnership between Payward and Mt. Gox was approved by the Tokyo district court on Wednesday. Kraken will not be paid for the arrangement but could win new clients as former account holders at Mt. Gox register to receive future distributions from the liquidation.  "We hope to revive bitcoin\'s reputation and create a healthy market for it, ultimately leading to profit for us," Ayako Miyaguchi, managing director of Kraken\'s Japanese operations,\u3000told reporters. Once handling 80 percent of the world\'s bitcoin trades, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in February in Tokyo after it lost 750,000 of its users\' bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. Mark Karpeles, the 28 year-old French CEO of Mt. Gox, blamed hackers for the loss.  The lost funds represented the equivalent of $480 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing. Mt. Gox also said $28 million were "missing" from its Japanese bank accounts. Karpeles later said he had recovered 200,000 of the lost bitcoins. The collapse of Mt.

Trendon Shavers, 32, of McKinney, Texas, was charged with\nmisappropriating about 146,000 of the 764,000 bitcoin, then\nworth more than $4.5 million, that he raised from September 2011\nto September 2012 by promising investors "absurdly high"\ninterest rates, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that trades on the Internet,\nwithout the backing of any government or central bank. The criminal case follows a Sept. 18 order by a federal\njudge in Texas that Shavers give up $40.7 million comprising\nillegal profit, interest and fines in a related U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission civil lawsuit. Known online as "pirateat40," Shavers allegedly gained\ncontrol of as much as 7 percent of the bitcoin market by\npromising investors up to 7 percent weekly interest, or 3,641\npercent annualized, based on his ability to trade the currency,\nand a promise that money could be withdrawn at any time. Instead, Shavers allegedly used new bitcoin to repay old\ninvestors, add to his account at the now-bankrupt Mt. Gox\nexchange, and fund expenses that included a used BMW M5 sedan,\nspa treatments, casino visits and a $1,000 dinner at Gallagher\'s\nSteakhouse in Las Vegas. About half the investors in Bitcoin Savings and Trust, which\nwas not incorporated and which Shavers ran by himself, lost some\nor all of their investments, prosecutors said. "Trendon Shavers managed to combine financial and cyber\nfraud into a bitcoin Ponzi scheme that offered absurdly high\ninterest payments, and ultimately cheated his investors out of\ntheir bitcoin investments," Bharara said in a statement. "This\ncase, the first of its kind, should serve as a warning to those\nlooking to make a quick buck with unsecured currency."

Start-up companies dealing in the budding technology could get a two-year partial waiver from complying with the full set of rules to help them continue their business, New York Superintendent of Financial Services Ben Lawsky said. The revised rules for obtaining the so-called BitLicense, which will be posted for a new round of comments in the coming days, would reduce the record-keeping requirements to seven years from 10 in the original proposal. Companies applying for a license also could count virtual currencies toward their capital requirements, Lawsky said. The new rules would not apply to software developers, individual users, customer loyalty programs and gift cards, currency miners, nor to merchants accepting it as a payment, Lawsky said in a speech in Washington. Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is independent of control or backing by any government - something its advocates like but that has also led to calls for more oversight and raised questions as to how to treat it for tax purposes. Bitcoin started circulating in 2009 and is accepted as payment by a small but increasing number of companies. Huge swings in its value and incidents where clients lost millions of dollars have hurt its reputation.

The banks are part of a consortium of 42 major lenders, brought together last year by New York-based software company R3 to work on ways blockchain technology could be used in financial markets - the first time so many have collaborated on using such systems.  A blockchain is a huge, decentralized ledger of every bitcoin transaction, verified and shared by a global computer network, that can also be used to secure and validate any exchange of data, including real assets, such as commodities or currencies.     Banks reckon the technology could save them money by cutting out middlemen and making their operations more transparent. But analysts caution it is early days - bitcoin was invented just six years ago and blockchain experiments are still under way. For this test, R3 used a Microsoft platform, which runs on a blockchain built by distributed ledger company Ethereum. The 11 banks in the simulation, operating across four continents, each used their own computer, or "node", and transferred "Ether" to each other - Ethereum\'s equivalent of bitcoin, R3 said.  They were able to settle the transactions almost instantaneously, it added. That compares to settlement times of days or even weeks, depending on the asset class, under the current systems used by banks.   R3 Managing Director Charley Cooper said the technology could be used by banks to transfer real assets within the next one or two years. "Rather than just talking about what we might do, we\'ve moved into a new phase, which is actually executing these plans and demonstrating how this technology might work in practice," said Tim Grant, who runs R3\'s test labs.

"When technology comes along like crypto-currency, which can replace at a far lower cost ... I am all for supporting it," Byrne said. Bitcoin payment processors such as Coinbase charge Overstock less than 1 percent, sometimes near zero, to process a transaction. A credit card payment, on the other hand typically has a 3 percent transaction fee, analysts said. Gil Luria, managing director and financial technology analyst at Wedbush Securities, said a 2 percent to 3 percent  savings in transaction costs is a meaningful number especially for retailers like Overstock, which has "razor-thin margins." Overstock also plans to accept bitcoin payments from international customers by mid-September this year. In addition, it will allocate 4 percent of bitcoin sales to promote the currency, effective mid-September as well. "We\'re in bitcoin for the long haul, I intend to make it permanent," said Byrne. "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are going to be around for as long as the law of mathematics works." On Wednesday, Overstock was down 1.2 percent at $17.23, while bitcoin fell 4 percent to $544.88 BTC=BTSP.

Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins outlined the risks\nthat e-currencies can pose to consumers, such as a lack of\nrecourse if money is lost or stolen, or if an exchange fails, as\nin the high-profile case of Mt. Gox earlier this year. There could also be ramifications for the central bank if\ne-money were to gain more widespread acceptance since changes in\nthe benchmark interest rate would have less effect on a system\nthat uses cryptocurrencies alongside the Canadian dollar,\nWilkins said. "In the unlikely situation in which cryptocurrencies were\nused broadly, a significant proportion of economic transactions\nwould not be denominated in Canadian dollars," Wilkins said in a\nprepared text to be delivered in Waterloo, Ontario. "This would reduce the bank\'s ability to influence\nmacroeconomic activity through Canadian interest rates," she\nsaid, adding that the country was nowhere near that point. As money and payment technologies progress, the Bank of\nCanada is helping the federal government modernize oversight\nframeworks, Wilkins said. The central bank is also undertaking\nresearch on the merits of issuing e-money. Cryptocurrencies are bought and sold on a peer-to-peer\nnetwork, independent of any central bank or government. Wilkins\nsaid bitcoin was not a reliable store of value, as its worth\nsoared from pennies to more than $1,100 and then fell back to\n$300 in just four years.\n\n (Reporting by Leah Schnurr and Randall Palmer; Editing by Lisa\nVon Ahn)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0T32EB20141113', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 11, 13, 15, 15), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'UPDATE 1-Bank of Canada: Bitcoin needs watching but no threat now'}, {'articleText': u' WASHINGTON TeraExchange on Friday launched a swap based on the bitcoin virtual currency, becoming the first to receive approval from a U.S. federal regulator for a financial product based on the budding technology. The derivative allows clients to protect the value of their bitcoin holdings by locking in a dollar value, offering an insurance against the astronomical price swings that have plagued the computer-generated currency. "For a merchant to take bitcoin, there wasn\'t until this product a regulated way for them to put on a hedge to manage the risk ... and now with this product they can," Christian Martin, who heads TeraExchange, told Reuters. Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is independent of control or backing by any government - something its advocates like, but that has also led to calls for more oversight and raised questions as to how to treat it for tax purposes. Bitcoin started circulating in 2009 and is accepted as payment by an increasing, if small, number of companies. But huge swings in its value, and incidents where clients lost millions of dollars have hurt its reputation. It took TeraExchange, which was launched in 2010, almost half a year to get the product past the regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, since first announcing its plans to launch the swap in March.  The company, one of a handful of platforms to facilitate regulated swaps trading that sprung up after the crisis, had to construct an index to gauge the value of bitcoin that the CFTC was satisfied could not easily be manipulated. The global scandal around the Libor interest rate benchmark, in which large banks were forced to pay billions of dollars, showed how easily traders can skew benchmarks, and then make profits through their swaps positions. The Tera Bitcoin Price Index was based on information from six different exchanges, the company said, a number it expected to grow. It had agreed with the exchanges to share information if there were suspicious price moves. A decision last year by the U.S. Treasury to classify exchangers of bitcoin as money transmitters put such firms under the remit of state regulators, and the industry has met with a fractured response from federal regulators. The decision by the CFTC, which regulates swaps and futures, constitutes the first recognition by a U.S. federal regulator of a bitcoin financial product, even if the product does not itself involve the exchange of actual bitcoins. The swap locks in the dollar value of a given bitcoin amount, and the difference is settled in dollars when the contract expires. At both moments, the contract references the new price index, which is published in real time. TeraExchange said it had signed up some 50 clients that were interested in the products, merchants, hardware suppliers and the so-called miners who retrieve the bitcoins from the computer programs that generate the virtual currency.

The BoE said the finite supply of Bitcoins - which are\ntraded between users outside the banking system, and used to buy\ngoods ranging from pizzas to PCs - meant that an economy where\nthey formed the main currency would be at risk of deflation. The supply of currencies such as sterling or the U.S. dollar\nis partly controlled by central banks, which aim to keep the\namount of currency in circulation in line with the value of\ngoods and services produced in the economy. But Bitcoin, which was introduced in 2009 and has more than\n1 million users world wide, is designed to have an upper limit\nof 21 million coins, and more than 13 million are already in\ncirculation. One Bitcoin is worth about $474, but its value has\nranged from $363.12 to $919.24 so far this year. Unpredictable exchange rates and the prospect of rising\ntransaction costs might limit the widespread adoption of Bitcoin\nand similar currencies, but a more fundamental problem was the\nfixed supply, the BoE said. "The inability of the money supply to vary in response to\ndemand would likely cause greater volatility in prices and real\nactivity," the BoE said. Demand for conventional currencies\nvaries for a number of reasons, ranging from Christmas holidays\nto recessions to technological change. Some supporters of Bitcoin view the fixed supply as an\nadvantage, because it stops governments or central banks from\naltering the currency supply to achieve political or economic\ngoals. The BoE created 375 billion pounds ($610 billion) of\ncurrency between 2009 and 2012 to buy government bonds and\nsupport the economy. Bitcoin can also offer far more anonymity than standard\nbanking systems, making it a popular choice for making illicit\ndeals on the Internet. The BoE said Bitcoin did not pose a threat to British\nfinancial stability at present. It estimated no more than 20,000\npeople in Britain had significant Bitcoin holdings, with fewer\nthan 300 transactions a day nationwide. Around 60 percent of Bitcoin trading is against the Chinese\nyuan, 32 percent is against the dollar and 3 percent against the\neuro, the BoE said. The central bank did see promise in some of the technology\nunderlying Bitcoin\'s decentralised payments system, which could\nbe more robust than electronic systems that rely on a handful of\nbanks verifying transactions. However, this hinged on digital currencies finding a way to\nretain enough users, known as "miners", to independently verify\ntransactions while keeping transaction costs low enough to\ncompete with banks. "A significant risk to digital currencies\' sustained use\n(is) that they will not be able to compete on cost without\ndegenerating ... to a monopoly miner, thereby ... exposing them\nto risk of system-wide fraud," the BoE said.\n ($1 = 0.6150 British Pounds)\n\n (Editing by Larry King)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'David Milliken'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0RC3IY20140911', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 11, 9, 11), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bank of England sees Bitcoin fraud risk, deflation danger'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2015/01/16/bitcoin-is-latest-victim-of-disinflation/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' BUCHAREST In a well-lit office with red window frames in downtown Bucharest, Romania\'s first bitcoin ATM attracts many who until it opened in May had to buy or sell the digital currency face-to-face or through wire transfers. The interest in bitcoin in Romania stands out in a region where national currencies are widely seen as poor substitutes for the euro.  Tech-savvy and still deeply distrustful of officialdom 25 years after the end of communism, many Romanians are unfazed by warnings about the cryptocurrency. In the western town of Oradea, 370 miles (595 km) away from the capital, the first bitcoin exchange in the country has drawn more than 2,000 clients in the seven months since it opened, with transactions totaling 5.12 million lei ($1.57 million).  But Romania ranks as the European Union\'s second-poorest state and among the weakest in collecting taxes and fighting fraud, making it poorly equipped to manage the bitcoin. Bitcoin is still an infant in Europe relative to the United States, where hundreds of start-ups backed by some Wall Street traders and venture capitalists have propelled consumer and media interest. Activity in virtual currencies around Europe is concentrated in London, Amsterdam and Berlin.  Romanian entrepreneurs envision a future where the bitcoin is as common as grocery shopping. But they say it needs a legal framework to gain credibility. "It is an industry in its early stages," said George Rotariu, who opened the ATM in Bucharest in collaboration with Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs and plans to expand to more Romanian cities. "You need a legislative framework to supply services or have a business in this field," he said.

INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS Its use has raised concerns for governments around the world, especially after Tokyo-based Mt Gox, once the world\'s leading bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy after saying some 850,000 bitcoins had gone missing. A report by Bank of America last year found bitcoin showed promise as a low-cost way to do e-commerce and as an alternative to traditional money transfer services, but could also be used to evade high taxes, capital controls and confiscation. \xa0 In July, the European Banking Authority, the EU\'s banking watchdog, urged national policymakers to discourage credit and payment institutions from buying, holding, or selling virtual currencies pending a regulatory framework. "Using bitcoin in Romania is not regulated and carries very large risks," said the Romanian Financial Supervision Authority (ASF). "The risk of fraud is also not to be ruled out." It said the industry "would need to have a visible economic significance in Romania, which it does not", before regulation is considered, adding it would enforce any EU-approved rules. Some EU states, including Finland, the United Kingdom, Germany or Poland have found ways to tax bitcoin transactions. But Romania collects just under 60 percent of its regular tax goal. That amounts to roughly 33 percent of economic output, well below the bloc\'s 46 percent average. "There is some preoccupation with bitcoin," one finance ministry official said. "But a legal framework is some time away and only after that will we analyze the need for a fiscal one."  BITCOIN VOLATILITY The number of Romanian service providers accepting bitcoins - which are divisible to eight decimal places - has risen slowly to a handful of coffeeshops, gyms, restaurants and beauty salons, according to service tracker coinmap.org.

Vuscan\'s exchange works only for Romanian leu deals, but he plans to open it to euro and dollar transactions, hoping to join larger European bitcoin exchanges such as Slovenia\'s Bitstamp. BTCXchange is registered as a standard company. Vuscan enforced some safeguards - users are required to have a bank account and there are self-imposed policies against money laundering. But there are no legal or regulatory safeguards. Bitcoin\'s rise in Romania is partially due to its status as one of Europe\'s active technology hubs.

His comments came after New York extended the period for virtual currency companies to comment on a set of proposed regulations, known as the "BitLicense" plan, that was unveiled by the state in July. The regulator aims to release a revised proposal by the end of October. "We are regulating financial intermediaries.\xa0We are not regulating software development," Lawsky said in a speech at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law\xa0in New York City. "To clarify, we do not intend to regulate software as software or software development.\xa0For example, a software developer who creates and provides wallet software to customers for their own use will not need a license." The "BitLicense" plan is the first proposal by a state to create guidelines specifically for virtual currencies. It includes proposed rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering, and cybersecurity.  The most prominent virtual currency right now is bitcoin, often used as an investment or as a way to pay for goods and services online. Bitcoin prices have been extremely volatile - they fell as low as $275 on the BitStamp platform on October 5 and rose as high as $1,123 in December 2013. On Tuesday, bitcoin was quoted at $406.61. Lawsky said companies that are developing the latest platforms for virtual currencies will not need a license, nor will individual users. Banks, however, will not be exempt. "The banks we regulate cannot start providing virtual currency services without prior approval from DFS (Department of Financial Services), and they will be have to comply with any requirements that are otherwise imposed on virtual currency businesses," Lawsky said.

His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said that what Shrem did was an aberration and that Shrem plans to continue working in the bitcoin world if possible. Agnifilo emphasized that his client was not involved in directly supplying bitcoin to Silk Road users.

Bitcoin made headlines earlier this year when Tokyo-based\nbitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy after saying it\nmight have lost some 750,000 bitcoins in hacking attack. Patrick Murck, general counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation,\nsaid cooperation was needed between authorities to create rules\nthat would support those using the digital currency responsibly. "There\'s an opportunity to work together to stop people\nsaying it\'s scary and risky," he said. "The challenge is just to\nget a framework out there that makes sense for people," said\nMurck, speaking at an event on the state of digital economy. Launched in 2009, bitcoin offers a way for people to conduct\ntransactions over the Internet. Supporters say the anonymity\nthat bitcoin offers lowers the risk of fraud, while critics say\nthat same anonymity and lack of central oversight make it easier\nto commit crimes. The Bitcoin Foundation aims to standardise the currency,\nprotect it from theft or counterfeiting and provide education. Some companies involved in bitcoin, including investment\nfirms and those providing services for the currency\'s users,\nhave also called for regulation to ensure their customers feel\nmore comfortable about virtual money. A number of regulators, including the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission, have warned investors about the risks of\nscams related to virtual currencies. Murck said there were a handful of well-funded companies\nworking towards making bitcoin more attractive and safer for\nordinary consumers by trying to insure bitcoin holdings and to\nreduce the currency\'s volatility. Those companies have learned from the collapse of Mt. Gox\nand have more knowledge about how the industry works that was\nnot available before, he said. Bitcoin could be ready for the mass market by the end of the\nyear, Murck added. "I feel much more confident today than I did\n12 months ago. The wind is definitely blowing at our backs." The banking industry also has a role to play in opening the\nbitcoin market up, Murck said, by providing finance to companies\ninvolved in bitcoin or integrating bitcoin services into its own\nproducts.

Draper is partnering with Palo Alto-based Vaurum, which\nfacilitates over-the-counter bitcoin trading, Vaurum Chief\nExecutive Officer Avish Bhama said in a statement. Draper, a\nmajor backer of Vaurum, will partner with the company to use the\ncoins as a liquidity source for Vaurum\'s trading platforms in\nemerging markets, the statement said. The bitcoins, a virtual currency that is "mined" by\ncomputers solving complex algorithms, were seized last year by\nthe Marshalls Service in a crackdown on illegal online activity. Acceptance of bitcoin has been growing as more merchants\nallow customers to pay for goods and services with the currency. "With the help of Vaurum and this newly purchased bitcoin,\nwe expect to be able to create new services that can provide\nliquidity and confidence to markets that have been hamstrung by\nweak currencies," Draper said in the statement. The U.S. Marshals Service auctioned off 29,655 bitcoin at an\nestimated worth of about $18 million in an online, sealed-bid\nauction that drew more than 40 bidders, including a number of\nwell-known players in the crypto-currency. Terms of the sale\nhave not been disclosed, but the success gives the virtual\ncurrency more legitimacy as a means of exchange. The bitcoin was part of 144,000 bitcoin seized in October in\na raid on Silk Road, an Internet black-market bazaar that\nauthorities said had been used for illegal drug transactions and\nother goods. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals Service said Wednesday\nit will not conduct another auction of bitcoins unless there is\na court order for the agency to do so. Draper is something of Silicon Valley royalty, the son of\none of the nation\'s first venture capitalists and father of\nanother. In 1985 he founded Draper Associates, the firm which\nwould grow into Draper Fisher Jurvetson, known for investments\nsuch as online communication service Skype, electric carmaker\nTesla and Chinese web services company Baidu. Like many in Silicon Valley, Draper has embraced bitcoin, \nwhich with its open internet architecture and growing use as an\nalternative currency, appeals to venture capitalists and their\nfondness for open and disruptive technologies. "Of course, no one is totally secure in holding their own\ncountry\'s currency.

Robert Faiella, 54, who prosecutors say was an underground exchanger of bitcoins, had urged a New York federal judge to dismiss one of two counts against him, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, because bitcoins are not money. But U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected that argument, saying bitcoins "clearly qualifies as \'money\' or \'funds,\'" under dictionary definitions, a position supported by legislative history in interpreting the law. "Bitcoin can be easily purchased in exchange for ordinary currency, acts as a denominator of value, and is used to conduct financial transactions," Rakoff wrote. The judge also rejected Faiella\'s arguments that his activities on Silk Road did not constitute "transmitting" money under federal law, saying that in sending customer funds to the website, he transferred the money to others for a profit. A lawyer for Faiella did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara declined comment. Faiella and Shrem, 24, face trial on Sept. 22. Shrem, one of the digital currency\'s most visible promoters, stepped down as vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a well-known trade group, soon after his arrest. Federal authorities shut down Silk Road last year, though a new Internet marketplace under the same name debuted in November. Prosecutors contend that Silk Road enabled used to buy and sell illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services. Meanwhile, prosecutors from Bharara\'s office have charged Ross William Ulbricht with operating the site under the name "Dread Pirate Roberts." He made similar arguments that bitcoin did not constitute money in claiming he was not involved in money laundering.

While computers and smartphones have brought the web to more than a third of the world\'s population, online commerce still largely depends on a banking system that has changed little over recent decades, some of it relying on computer code written before the web was born. The growing interest in bitcoin, a digital currency that requires no centralized body to handle transactions, is beginning to change all that. "The rise of bitcoin has changed everyone\'s idea of what a good payment system should be," says Manu Sporny, CEO of web payments company Digital Bazaar, who is spearheading an effort to get the industry together to agree on standards for handling online transactions. "Bitcoin raised the bar, so everyone\'s got to come in and match that in some way." A key moment, Sporny and others say, will be a meeting in Paris next week hosted by the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, one of the key bodies for setting internet standards. Gathering for the first time to discuss web payment standards will be telecom operators such as Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica and AT&T, payment companies including SWIFT, PayPal and Gemalto, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve. Bitcoin can claim some credit for this buzz of activity. Much of the focus on bitcoin has been on its meteoric rise in value - soaring from $30 a year ago to above $1,000 late in the year - which has been only slightly dented by the collapse last month of Mt. Gox, a leading bitcoin exchange, with half a billion dollars\' worth of bitcoins missing. But bitcoin as a currency might be a distraction. Underpinning the digital currency is a combination of key computing principles - decentralized timestamping, public key cryptography and a proof of work system - that promise to revolutionize transactions. Says Peter Vessenes, CEO of bitcoin start-up CoinLab and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group promoting its adoption: "Those three could be turned into money, but they could also do a lot of other things." CHEAPER DEALS What interests some, and worries others, among those due to attend the Paris meeting is the promise bitcoin offers in cutting the cost of moving money around. "If they can have it cheaper, they will make it cheaper," said Marcus Swanepoel of Switchless, a Singapore-based company offering to integrate bitcoin processes into traditional banks and telecom companies. Bitcoin poses a challenge for those used to handling consumer transactions: PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that credit card companies charge around 3 percent in transaction fees. PayPal\'s cut can go as high as 4 percent. Those same transactions via bitcoin firms such as Coinbase and BitPay, which bypass central financial institutions, are as likely to be free. However, Visa Inc\'s head of innovation Jim McCarthy told an investors\' conference this month that while there were things to be learned about bitcoin, "I don\'t see those as the things that are going to tip the apple cart anytime soon." MasterCard and Visa will not be at the Paris meeting, noted Sporny. "GETTING WHACKED" Indeed, there\'s plenty of skepticism that bitcoin will amount to anything, with critics pointing to recent setbacks such as Mt. Gox and the libertarian bent of some of its supporters, as indicators it\'s little more than a Ponzi scheme. Some of bitcoin\'s doubters come from within. Mike Hearn, a key contributor to the code underpinning bitcoin, dismisses talk of Ponzi schemes, but worries about complacency. "A lot of people seem to believe it\'s a done deal, a dead cert. And I don\'t see it that way at all." Hearn says that if bitcoin is going to challenge or win over the banking mainstream it needs to adopt better security while making it easier to use. And then, it needs to reach out to overcome the banking world\'s anxiety about regulators and its perceived links to crime. "The banking blockage, where all banks are afraid of touching bitcoin because they\'re afraid of getting whacked by governments, is still the biggest challenge that bitcoin faces," he said. COOPERATION Switchless\' Swanepoel believes this fear is already dissipating. Standard Bank of South Africa, for example, recently ran a pilot using Switchless technology to integrate bitcoin trading into the bank\'s own currency systems. He sees similar interest among telephone operators and post offices looking for a cheap way to build a system to handle monetary transactions. But if bitcoin does make it into these behemoths, it\'s likely to accompany existing technologies. "You don\'t see bitcoin as something that would eliminate how things are done at the moment," Swanepoel said in a phone interview. "They\'re more likely to sit side by side." Start-up Ripple, for example, offers a way for users to buy and sell currencies using some bitcoin technologies but not its computer-hogging method of confirmation, called mining. End users needn\'t know or care that they\'re using a system with bitcoin roots. "Then people won\'t even know they\'re using it, they\'ll be using brands that they trust that will be using these protocols. All they\'ll know is that they suddenly get to send money to India for free, instantly," said Ripple CEO Chris Larsen. MOBILE WALLET Bitcoin\'s biggest potential market may be among the millions of people with limited access to proper banking services. Bitcoin naturally lends itself to the idea of a mobile wallet, and of small payments that have so far been too expensive for mass adoption. Users of dogecoin, a variant of bitcoin, for example, raised funds for the Jamaican bobsled team and three Indian athletes to go to last month\'s Winter Olympics, and this week raised more than $30,000 to build wells in Kenya. Bitcoin and its offshoots also offer a way round government currency controls - either by converting fiat currency to a virtual currency that can be sent overseas, or by bypassing the local currency entirely. Next week, an Icelander who calls himself Baldur Friggjar \xd3\xf0insson will start releasing a new crypto-currency he has created himself, Auroracoin, to all Icelanders who want some. The idea, he said in an email interview, "is to free the Icelandic people from fiat currency and currency controls" by giving them access to a currency that can be traded online or, in theory, used to pay for goods and services. Icelanders have been restricted from converting their cash into foreign currency since the 2008 financial crisis. Each Icelander can download their allocation of Auroracoins, worth about $500 at current prices, from a website. "Hopefully this is the beginning of a lasting revolution, where the power over money is removed from the elite and placed in the hands of the people," Baldur said. BEYOND MONEY Revolutionary talk aside, the legacy of bitcoin could be in the way it can decentralize any kind of transaction. The record of all transactions using the bitcoin protocol are stored in something called a blockchain - a log of where all bitcoins have changed hands. Forget bitcoin as merely a currency, said the foundation\'s Vessenes, and think of it as a decentralized way to confer and agree ownership. The smallest unit of bitcoin, the satoshi, could be a token that represents ownership of a share - with details of who should be paid a dividend, or who can vote at shareholder meetings - all built directly into the token. Ownership of a car could be managed the same way, so it only responds to someone who can prove possession and ownership of that token. "Money, or what one perceives as money, is just a form of disintermediated trust," says Pindar Wong, a Hong Kong-based consultant who has been working on internet-based payment technologies. "There\'s a whole scope of innovation here and we\'re just touching the tip of a very big iceberg."

At least 10 members of the nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation have resigned over last week\'s election of onetime Disney child star and current Bitcoin entrepreneur and financier Brock Pierce as a new director, officials at the group said. Some of the members cited Pierce\'s troubled past. That includes allegations in lawsuits from three employees of Pierce\'s first company, bankrupt web video business Digital Entertainment Network, that he provided drugs and pressured them for sex when they were minors. Pierce has denied the accusations, which first surfaced in 2000. "The allegations against me are not true, and I have never had intimate or sexual contact with any of the people who made those allegations," Pierce told Reuters via email. Court records show 33-year-old Pierce, who played the title role in Disney\'s "First Kid," paid more than $21,000 to settle one employee suit, and he said others dropped their claims without money changing hands. While Bitcoin Foundation officials played down the defections, several members who resigned from the Foundation assailed its governance track record. "The track record of prominent Bitcoin Foundation members has been abysmal," said Patrick Alexander, a resigning Foundation member in a post on its discussion pages. "I no longer want to be associated with these people." Attempts to reach him for additional comment were unsuccessful. Though it is highly volatile, the value of the electronic currency in existence has skyrocketed into the billions of dollars as the number of businesses accepting it has increased and investors have sought to create new ways for it to be used. More than 1,000 Bitcoin investors, business people and enthusiasts are expected to attend the conference in Amsterdam. The programming effort that governs how Bitcoin works is led by Gavin Andresen, who is chief scientist at the Foundation and gets a salary from it. The Foundation also plays an important role for Bitcoin in lobbying on its behalf in various jurisdiction as authorities grapple with how to police the semi-anonymous currency. CALL TO VET CANDIDATES Other members who resigned called on the board to more carefully vet future candidates as well as remove Pierce from the board. Bitcoin Foundation General Counsel Patrick Murck said that his group had more than 1,500 members and would bounce back from the latest controversy. "Democracy is messy sometimes," Murck said. "If in the future members decide they want to have a vetting process, that\'s great." Some Bitcoin Foundation members say they weren\'t aware of Pierce\'s past until after the election, when others circulated media accounts concerning the allegations. Pierce was voted in by the Foundation\'s industry members, who pay higher dues, to fill one of two spots vacated by others who had resigned: Mark Karpeles, chief executive of the bankrupt top Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, and Charlie Shrem, who has been charged with conspiring to launder money for users of the shuttered Silk Road underground drug bazaar. Pierce has made a splash in the insular Bitcoin world by backing more than a dozen startups, speaking frequently at conferences, and leading a bid to buy Mt. Gox for one Bitcoin, currently worth less than $500. Bitcoin startups have attracted investment from some venture capital firms and from individuals through "crowdfunding," in which many amateurs support projects, often with small investments and without the due diligence typically conducted by professional investors. Pierce has been a major beneficiary of the trend, garnering pledges of more than $700,000 for his investment syndicate on the crowdfunding site AngelList. Cyan Banister, a startup CEO who made a nonbinding pledge of $5,000 to Pierce\'s investing syndicate, after learning of the allegations said she would withdraw from his group. Phil Sanderson, an IDG Ventures investor in San Francisco who follows Bitcoin, said that the currency\'s growth was being hindered by the lack of effective public faces. "Bitcoin hasn\'t really had a strong, vocal leader with a great background," he said. (This story corrects spelling of Mt.

While computers and smartphones have brought the web to more\nthan a third of the world\'s population, online commerce still\nlargely depends on a banking system that has changed little over\nrecent decades, some of it relying on computer code written\nbefore the web was born. The growing interest in bitcoin, a digital currency that\nrequires no centralized body to handle transactions, is\nbeginning to change all that. "The rise of bitcoin has changed everyone\'s idea of what a\ngood payment system should be," says Manu Sporny, CEO of web\npayments company Digital Bazaar, who is spearheading an effort\nto get the industry together to agree on standards for handling\nonline transactions. "Bitcoin raised the bar, so everyone\'s got\nto come in and match that in some way." A key moment, Sporny and others say, will be a meeting in\nParis next week hosted by the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C,\none of the key bodies for setting internet standards. Gathering for the first time to discuss web payment\nstandards will be telecom operators such as Deutsche Telekom\n, Telefonica and AT&T, payment\ncompanies including SWIFT, PayPal and Gemalto,\nas well as the U.S. Federal Reserve. Bitcoin can claim some credit for this buzz of activity. Much of the focus on bitcoin has been on its meteoric rise\nin value - soaring from $30 a year ago to above $1,000 late in\nthe year - which has been only slightly dented by the collapse\nlast month of Mt. Gox, a leading bitcoin exchange, with half a\nbillion dollars\' worth of bitcoins missing. But bitcoin as a currency might be a distraction. Underpinning the digital currency is a combination of key\ncomputing principles - decentralized timestamping, public key\ncryptography and a proof of work system - that promise to\nrevolutionise transactions. Says Peter Vessenes, CEO of bitcoin start-up CoinLab and\nchairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group promoting\nits adoption: "Those three could be turned into money, but they\ncould also do a lot of other things."  CHEAPER DEALS What interests some, and worries others, among those due to\nattend the Paris meeting is the promise bitcoin offers in\ncutting the cost of moving money around. "If they can have it cheaper, they will make it cheaper,"\nsaid Marcus Swanepoel of Switchless, a Singapore-based company\noffering to integrate bitcoin processes into traditional banks\nand telecom companies. Bitcoin poses a challenge for those used to handling\nconsumer transactions: PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that\ncredit card companies charge around 3 percent in transaction\nfees. PayPal\'s cut can go as high as 4 percent. Those same\ntransactions via bitcoin firms such as Coinbase and BitPay,\nwhich bypass central financial institutions, are as likely to be\nfree. However, Visa Inc\'s head of innovation Jim McCarthy\ntold an investors\' conference this month that while there were\nthings to be learned about bitcoin, "I don\'t see those as the\nthings that are going to tip the apple cart anytime soon." MasterCard and Visa will not be at the Paris meeting,\nnoted Sporny.  "GETTING WHACKED" Indeed, there\'s plenty of skepticism that bitcoin will\namount to anything, with critics pointing to recent setbacks\nsuch as Mt. Gox and the libertarian bent of some of its\nsupporters, as indicators it\'s little more than a Ponzi scheme. Some of bitcoin\'s doubters come from within. Mike Hearn, a\nkey contributor to the code underpinning bitcoin, dismisses talk\nof Ponzi schemes, but worries about complacency. "A lot of\npeople seem to believe it\'s a done deal, a dead cert. And I\ndon\'t see it that way at all." Hearn says that if bitcoin is going to challenge or win over\nthe banking mainstream it needs to adopt better security while\nmaking it easier to use. And then, it needs to reach out to\novercome the banking world\'s anxiety about regulators and its\nperceived links to crime. "The banking blockage, where all banks are afraid of\ntouching bitcoin because they\'re afraid of getting whacked by\ngovernments, is still the biggest challenge that bitcoin faces,"\nhe said.  COOPERATION Switchless\' Swanepoel believes this fear is already\ndissipating. Standard Bank of South Africa, for\nexample, recently ran a pilot using Switchless technology to\nintegrate bitcoin trading into the bank\'s own currency systems. He sees similar interest among telephone operators and post\noffices looking for a cheap way to build a system to handle\nmonetary transactions. But if bitcoin does make it into these\nbehemoths, it\'s likely to accompany existing technologies. "You\ndon\'t see bitcoin as something that would eliminate how things\nare done at the moment," Swanepoel said in a phone interview.\n"They\'re more likely to sit side by side." Start-up Ripple, for example, offers a way for users to buy\nand sell currencies using some bitcoin technologies but not its\ncomputer-hogging method of confirmation, called mining. End\nusers needn\'t know or care that they\'re using a system with\nbitcoin roots. "Then people won\'t even know they\'re using it, they\'ll be\nusing brands that they trust that will be using these protocols.\nAll they\'ll know is that they suddenly get to send money to\nIndia for free, instantly," said Ripple CEO Chris Larsen.  MOBILE WALLET Bitcoin\'s biggest potential market may be among the millions\nof people with limited access to proper banking services. Bitcoin naturally lends itself to the idea of a mobile\nwallet, and of small payments that have so far been too\nexpensive for mass adoption. Users of dogecoin, a variant of\nbitcoin, for example, raised funds for the Jamaican bobsled team\nand three Indian athletes to go to last month\'s Winter Olympics,\nand this week raised more than $30,000 to build wells in Kenya. Bitcoin and its offshoots also offer a way round government\ncurrency controls - either by converting fiat currency to a\nvirtual currency that can be sent overseas, or by bypassing the\nlocal currency entirely. Next week, an Icelander who calls himself Baldur Friggjar\n\xd3\x7finsson will start releasing a new crypto-currency he has\ncreated himself, Auroracoin, to all Icelanders who want some.\nThe idea, he said in an email interview, "is to free the\nIcelandic people from fiat currency and currency controls" by\ngiving them access to a currency that can be traded online or,\nin theory, used to pay for goods and services.

Bitcoin made headlines earlier this year when Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy after saying it might have lost some 750,000 bitcoins in hacking attack. Patrick Murck, general counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation, said cooperation was needed between authorities to create rules that would support those using the digital currency responsibly. "There\'s an opportunity to work together to stop people saying it\'s scary and risky," he said. "The challenge is just to get a framework out there that makes sense for people," said Murck, speaking at an event on the state of digital economy. Launched in 2009, bitcoin offers a way for people to conduct transactions over the Internet. Supporters say the anonymity that bitcoin offers lowers the risk of fraud, while critics say that same anonymity and lack of central oversight make it easier to commit crimes. The Bitcoin Foundation aims to standardise the currency, protect it from theft or counterfeiting and provide education. Some companies involved in bitcoin, including investment firms and those providing services for the currency\'s users, have also called for regulation to ensure their customers feel more comfortable about virtual money. A number of regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have warned investors about the risks of scams related to virtual currencies. Murck said there were a handful of well-funded companies working towards making bitcoin more attractive and safer for ordinary consumers by trying to insure bitcoin holdings and to reduce the currency\'s volatility. Those companies have learned from the collapse of Mt. Gox and have more knowledge about how the industry works that was not available before, he said. Bitcoin could be ready for the mass market by the end of the year, Murck added. "I feel much more confident today than I did 12 months ago. The wind is definitely blowing at our backs." The banking industry also has a role to play in opening the bitcoin market up, Murck said, by providing finance to companies involved in bitcoin or integrating bitcoin services into its own products.

The well-known Silicon Valley investor partnered with Palo Alto-based Vaurum, which facilitates over-the-counter bitcoin trading, for the sale but would not discuss how much he paid.  Draper, a major backer of Vaurum, will partner with the startup to use the coins as a liquidity source for Vaurum\'s trading platforms in emerging markets, Draper told reporters in Palo Alto on Wednesday. "If they thought that they were going to try to put the kibosh on bitcoin, I think they would have just buried these," Draper said, referring to the government\'s stance on the currency. "Instead, they decided that this was of real value to society." The bitcoins, a virtual currency that is "mined" by computers solving complex algorithms, were seized last year by the Marshals Service in a crackdown on illegal online activity.      Acceptance of bitcoin has been growing as more merchants allow customers to pay for goods and services with the currency. The U.S. Marshals Service auctioned off 29,655 bitcoins at an estimated worth of about $18 million in an online, sealed-bid auction that drew more than 40 bidders, including a number of well-known players in the crypto-currency. Terms of the sale have not been disclosed, but the success gives the virtual currency more legitimacy as a means of exchange. The bitcoins auctioned off were part of 144,000 bitcoins seized in October in a raid on Silk Road, an Internet black-market bazaar that authorities said had been used for illegal drug transactions and other goods. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals Service said it will not conduct another auction of bitcoins unless there is a court order for the agency to do so. Draper told reporters his next fund will sport "a very high concentration" of bitcoin related investments.     "Of course, no one is totally secure in holding their own country\u2019s currency. We want to enable people to hold and trade bitcoin to secure themselves against weakening currencies," the Vaurum statement said.         Draper is from a prominent Silicon Valley family, the son of one of the nation\'s first venture capitalists and father of another. In 1985 he founded Draper Associates,\xa0which would grow into Draper Fisher Jurvetson, known for investments such as online communication service Skype, electric carmaker Tesla and Chinese web services company Baidu. Like many in Silicon Valley, Draper has embraced bitcoin. With its open internet architecture and growing use as an alternative currency, it appeals to venture capitalists fond of open and disruptive technologies.  Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures back bitcoin wallet Coinbase and Lightspeed Ventures backs bitcoin exchange BTC China. In addition to Draper, Vaurum has backing from former AOL Chief Executive Officer Steve Case and Battery Ventures.

The virtual currency has come under the scrutiny of regulators in both the United States and Europe following a series of high-profile scandals such as the bankruptcy of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. But authorities such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have not yet taken a uniform approach to regulating the nascent digital currency, and have limited themselves to issuing warnings about its risks for investors. "One of the challenges is that without clear guidance from the EU, from the UK, it will limit industry development," said Jeremy Allaire, head of Circle, a bitcoin consumer finance company that allows people to use and store bitcoins online. "Unless they have a clear view of where does this (bitcoin) fit, how do we know what the rules are?" he said in an interview with Reuters. Launched in 2009, bitcoin offers a way for people to conduct transactions over the Internet. Its backers say its anonymity - users do not need to reveal any card or financial details when making payments - protects people from fraud. Critics say this also makes it easier to commit crimes like buying illegal drugs online. Last October U.S. authorities seized 144,000 bitcoins online in a raid on Silk Road, an Internet black-market bazaar that authorities said had been used for illegal drug transactions. Some of those bitcoins were auctioned off last week. Allaire said bitcoins could be regulated in the same way as  other payment services such as PayPal, with strict consumer protection safeguards so people would feel safer using them. The EU\'s law regulating payment services should be updated to reflect the use of bitcoins, he added. Bitcoin supporters maintain that digital currencies are set to expand further and that as they become more mainstream the price volatility and scams that have so far bedevilled them will decrease.  In June online travel agency Expedia began accepting bitcoins as a form of payment. "As bigger exchanges get built and you see it move from retail and speculative investors to more traditional institutional investors ... you\'ll see greater price stability," said Allaire. Last week\'s auction of almost 30,000 bitcoins by the U.S. law enforcement authorities attracted bids from several high-profile investors, such as U.S. investment firm Pantera Capital.  The auction was won by one bidder, Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper, who called it a vote of confidence by the U.S. government in the nascent crypto-currency.  Allaire said authorities on both sides of the Atlantic were starting to come to terms with the rise of digital currency after initially shunning it. "A number of these regulatory bodies have started to analyze it and look at the risks," he said. "Most scratched their heads at the beginning and said \'do I need to care about this? I just want it to go away.\'"   (Editing by Mark Trevelyan)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Julia Fioretti'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0F827J20140703', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 3, 14, 24), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin pioneer calls for regulatory guidance from EU'}, {'articleText': u' NEW YORK The U.S. government on Thursday held its final auction of bitcoins seized during the prosecution of the creator of Silk Road, an online black market where the virtual currency could be used to buy illegal drugs and other goods. The U.S. Marshals Service said a six-hour online auction it held for about 44,341 bitcoins worth more than $17.2 million drew 11 registered bidders and 30 bids. No further details will be released until the bitcoins have been transferred to any winners, which could occur by Monday, said Lynzey Donahue, a Marshals Service spokeswoman. The bitcoins in the auction are the last remaining in custody in connection with the federal prosecution of Ross Ulbricht, who authorities say ran Silk Road. Silk Road operated for more than two years, generating more than $214 million in sales of drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoins, before being shut down in October 2013, prosecutors said. Bitcoins are used as a vehicle for moving money around the world quickly and anonymously via the Web without the need for third-party verification. The Marshals Service conducted auctions in June and December 2014 for nearly 80,000 bitcoins seized during the raid of Silk Road, and one this past March for 50,000 bitcoins. Thursday\'s auction includes 21 blocks of 2,000 bitcoins and one block of over 2,341 bitcoins. Winners will be notified Friday. Among those who said they planned to participate in the auction was Genesis Global Trading, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), according to Barry Silbert, a prominent bitcoin investor and DCG founder and chief executive officer. DCG, a holding firm focused on investing and developing businesses that deal in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, recently raised a round of funding from some large U.S. financial companies such as Bain Capital Ventures and Mastercard. DCG\'s former predecessor SecondMarket, also founded by Silbert, won a previous bitcoin auction. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper, who was also successful in two prior bitcoin sales, meanwhile in an email said he was not participating the latest auction.  "It seems like the world is waking back up to bitcoin," he wrote. The latest auction comes amid a surge the price of the virtual currency, with the price of a single bitcoin hitting $500 on Wednesday for the first time since August 2014. The price later fell, and by late Thursday, one bitcoin was worth $388, according to the Bitstamp exchange.

Gox. Internet criminals, security experts say, are attracted to bitcoin because of its stratospheric rise in value, because it\'s easier to steal than real money, and because it\'s easier to trade with other criminal elements. But, they add, bitcoin will survive the damage. "It\'s just growing pains," says Keith Jarvis, a security researcher at Dell SecureWorks. "Bitcoin is large enough and has enough momentum behind it to survive any public relations damage from this (Mt. Gox) case or anything else." The fall of Mt Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange which filed for bankruptcy last month after saying it lost some 850,000 bitcoins to hackers,  is certainly the virtual currency\'s biggest crisis. But data collated by Reuters from specialist bitcoin industry websites and internet forums shows that more than 730,000 bitcoins were already missing to theft, hacking, cyber-ransom payments and other apparently criminal pursuits before Mt. Gox\'s collapse. That\'s nearly 6 percent of all bitcoins, and doesn\'t include dozens, possibly hundreds, of unreported cases of individuals who have lost bitcoins from their computers or online exchanges to hackers. For sure, there\'s no way of telling who has these missing bitcoins, or whether they were converted to real money when the price was much lower. And of course some bitcoins may have been counted twice if criminals stole them from each other or they were put back into circulation and stolen again. But there\'s no question that bitcoins have attracted the attention of cyber-criminals - as a currency and an asset worth stealing. BEWARE MALWARE A study by Pat Litke and Joe Stewart of Dell SecureWorks showed that as the price of bitcoin soared beyond $1,000 last year, so did the number of viruses designed to steal bitcoins from wallets - programs that hold bitcoins on user\'s computers or smartphones. Of the 140 types of such software more than 100 appeared in the past year. Writing such viruses, says Stewart, is easy. "There\'s no sophistication involved in the storage of bitcoin in wallets. As for malware, it\'s some of the easiest stuff to write." Indeed, this cyber-pocket picking wasn\'t criminals\' first foray into bitcoins. Initially, they focused on using their control of large networks of infected computers - called botnets - to make their own bitcoins. Bitcoins are created through a \'mining\' process where a computer\'s resources are used to perform millions of calculations. For a while, says Kirill Levchenko, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, criminals added malware to their botnets to turn infected computers into bitcoin miners. This triggered predictions of doom for bitcoin - that the criminals would take over the mining of bitcoin through botnets and bring the whole currency crashing down. But as bitcoins become harder to mine - according to an algorithm that slows down their production the more people try to create them - this approach has proven less profitable. In 2012-13, says Danny Huang, another researcher at the University of California, San Diego, they earned at least 4,500 bitcoins, a relatively small sum compared with the total produced. "Few botnets are mining bitcoins now," he said. Instead, they\'ve turned to stealing them from wallets, or, more lucratively, from exchanges. According to data compiled last year by academics Tyler Moore and Nicholas Christin, of 40 exchanges tracked 18 had closed, with customer balances wiped out in many cases - not always, they point out, due to fraud. Since then, according to public reports, more than a dozen others have been hacked. CURRENCY OF THIEVES Cyber-criminals have also made use of the ease with which bitcoins can be traded without any third party - such as a bank or online payments service like PayPal - to use it as at least one way of paying for services between themselves. "Bitcoin made it much easier for them, because they have to trust each other even less. Even complete strangers can cooperate," said Juraj Bednar, a bitcoin security expert in Slovakia. But while bitcoin has its advantages, it\'s not a perfect tool for the bad guys. Take, for example, ransomware. Viruses which encrypt users\' data and then demand payment for a key to unlock it have become increasingly sophisticated, says Dell Secureworks\' Jarvis. The most successful: CryptoLocker, which Jarvis believes is run by a Russian-speaking gang who are also behind a botnet called Gameover Zeus that targets financial websites. Bitcoin often appears on CryptoLocker as an option for victims to pay up. Its appeal, says Bednar, lies in the fact that it needs no third party for the transaction to work. But there have been problems. For one thing, the type of user to be infected by a virus wasn\'t likely to be the type who is technologically savvy enough to be familiar with bitcoin. Also, as bitcoin rose in value, it has become a more expensive option for the victim, forcing the criminals to lower their bitcoin ransom demands to match prevailing exchange rates. TRACING TRANSACTIONS Then there\'s bitcoin\'s transparency. All transactions are visible, and while they\'re just digits and letters, in theory they could be connected to an individual and the entire history of all the bitcoin\'s transactions traced. Italian computer engineer Michele Spagnuolo, for example, was able to trace a number of ransom payments for CryptoLocker. The gains have been impressive: he and academics from Politecnico di Milano speculate that up to 6,757 bitcoins - then worth around $6 million - could be linked to those behind CryptoLocker late last year. That estimate of their total takings, he says, could be very conservative. But the fact that such payments can be traced would raise a red flag for cyber-criminals, says Daniel Cohen of RSA, the security division of EMC Corp, even though there are online services that can "launder" bitcoins to hide their origin. "Sure, there are bitcoin laundering services, but still if I tie a wallet to an identity I can see every single movement," he said. And, ironically, the success that some criminals have had in stealing bitcoins has made it less appealing to the underworld. RSA\'s Cohen says his team monitoring underground forums has noticed criminals lately see bitcoin as "volatile, seizable and, with the recent thefts, unsafe." FIXES NEEDED That\'s not to say bitcoin is out of the woods. While the protocols underlying bitcoin have proved themselves to work, the weak links have been the software containing the wallets, whether on exchanges or on individuals\' computers. "The attacks on the exchanges did not in themselves indicate any particular weakness of bitcoin per se, but rather exploiting vulnerabilities within the exchanges," says Raj Samani of Intel Corp\'s internet security company McAfee. Such holes are being addressed, says Dell Secureworks\' Stewart, pointing to such innovations as hardware wallets to replace software ones. "We\'re just going to have to get into that mode of thinking," he says. For now, bitcoin users remain a vulnerable target. That was illustrated when hackers breached Mt. Gox\'s servers and its owner\'s blog this week to post files purporting to be Mt. Gox\'s transactions in bitcoin stretching back to 2011. Amid the files lurked another surprise awaiting the unwary: a bitcoin-stealing virus.

Gox on Friday filed for bankruptcy protection, saying it may have lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of the virtual coins due to hacking into its faulty computer system. How it managed to lose so much so quickly is still unclear. U.S. federal prosecutors have subpoenaed Tokyo-based Mt. Gox - and other bitcoin businesses - to seek information on a recent spate of disruptive cyber attacks that overwhelmed some exchanges and forced them to suspend withdrawals. Mt. Gox never recovered, whereas rivals such as Slovenia-based Bitstamp have since resumed operations. "The first wave of entrepreneurs were evangelists for the technology, but low on quality," said Nick Shalek, an investor at Ribbit Capital, which has backed bitcoin companies including digital-wallet Coinbase. Now, he said, a more serious group of entrepreneurs is trying to build more serious infrastructure around bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital currency that, unlike conventional money, is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value has soared in the last year, and the total worth of bit coins minted is now about $7 billion. Mt. Gox\'s decline, ironically, started just as bitcoin was hitting a new level of notoriety in the broader public. Proponents include prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists who talked up a virtual currency system free of government intervention or control. THE FACE OF BITCOIN Founded in 2009 by American software hacker Jed McCaleb, Mt. Gox was originally a site for people to trade cards for a game called "Magic: The Gathering." (Mt. Gox is short for "Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange") McCaleb turned the site into a bitcoin exchange and sold the fledgling business in 2011 to Mark Karpeles. Under the Frenchman, Mt. Gox became the face of bitcoin - where investors regularly checked the price of the digital currency and where the largest volume of trades occurred. As regulators started to take notice of the bitcoin market, Karpeles became a vocal champion. He described Mt. Gox as "the main exchange" and argued for bitcoin\'s legitimacy while trying to distance it from criminals using the digital currency for money laundering or drug-related activities. Karpeles said Mt. Gox had no interest in helping criminals launder funds, and pushed back against claims that bitcoin transactions were completely anonymous, noting that while the system was designed for privacy, it was easy to track bitcoin across the network. If authorities found a way to shut down Mt. Gox, "the likely result will be more exchanges popping up all over, with methods much harder to track, and who will be much less likely to agree to help with any investigation," Karpeles said in a 2011 email to a reporter for the Compliance Complete service of Thomson Reuters Accelus. "We want (authorities) to understand that the problem is not bitcoin itself, but what some people do with those," he said in the message, one of numerous emailed exchanges over the years. In 2011, bitcoin was barely trading at $1, but volumes were picking up at Mt. Gox, which routinely saw more than 20,000 transactions daily, more than double those in late 2010. Karpeles said Mt. Gox had servers in the United States but little in the way of money. It used Iowa-based online payment processor Dwolla Inc to make U.S. customer transactions easier. RISE IN POPULARITY Bitcoin\'s popularity increased incrementally, similar to its price. On April 1, 2013, it topped $100 for the first time, and trading volumes were increasing. Around this time, a regulatory push intensified. The U.S. Treasury Department\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) declared bitcoin exchanges to be money transmitters, requiring them to register, enact formal anti-money laundering programs, and report suspicious activity. Shortly after that, a bitcoin exchange known as bitfloor was shuttered after its U.S. bank account was closed because it had not properly registered with regulators. Concerns that regulatory action would cause customer funds to be trapped resulted in a sharp plunge in bitcoin, falling from $230 on April 10 to a low of $68.49 on April 17 - a period of time that turned out to be the peak in terms of dollar-denominated trading on Mt. Gox, according to Bitcoincharts. As volumes jumped that month - on two separate days, there were more than 500,000 dollar-denominated transactions on Mt. Gox - the exchange said it was overwhelmed by the volumes, and it was working to upgrade its systems. Karpeles said in an April 13 email that bitfloor\'s closure was a fate that would not befall Mt. Gox. "We apply very strict AML (anti-money laundering) procedures to avoid exactly this kind of issue. We have very good relationships with our banking partners and making sure everything is run as good as possible." On April 18, Karpeles clarified that Dwolla was the company\'s only transaction provider. "We do not use any U.S. bank," he said via email. Mt. Gox did not immediately register with FinCEN - a misstep that would in part lead to its demise. In May 2013, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security froze an account that Dwolla held at Veridian Credit Union in the name of Mutum Sigillum LLC, a Mt. Gox subsidiary incorporated in Delaware. A related court document said another account at Wells Fargo had been seized earlier that month. The Department of Homeland Security justified the seizures by accusing Mt. Gox of failing to register with Treasury as demanded by FinCEN. (It eventually registered in June.) Karpeles has declined to comment on the seizures, but this complicated the ability of Mt. Gox to allow U.S. customers to liquidate existing investments. Dwolla eventually ended its relationship with Mt. Gox, in a blow to the exchange. "Most professional users moved away from Mt. Gox months ago, leaving April 2013 or thereabouts. By June 2013, the final nail was in the coffin for U.S. users," said one of bitcoin\'s core developers, who requested anonymity. This in turn caused bitcoin\'s prices on Mt. Gox to surge. "What happened then is because you couldn\'t withdraw dollars, there became a major premium for bitcoin on Mt. Gox," said Jacob Dienelt, a maker of bitcoin paper wallets in New York. CYBER ATTACKS The rise in bitcoin\'s value gave it more cachet with the general public, even though most people were still uninformed about exactly what bitcoin was. Dollar trading volumes started to diminish on Mt. Gox then - from about 66,770 transactions daily in May to a little over 14,000 in September. Volumes surged for a few months, but dropped to about 9,000 daily by January, according to bitcoincharts. Those in the industry said Mt. Gox ceased to be the exchange of choice about nine months ago as competitors such as Bitstamp gained prominence. By the start of this year, Mt. Gox was considered a diminished player due to concerns about its technology and safety. "It was obvious there was something really bad going on there for nearly a year. They were processing withdrawals very slowly and generally being very opaque about what was going on," said Mike Hearn, a bitcoin developer based in Switzerland. Mt. Gox\'s problems earlier this month stemmed from "distributed denial of service" attacks, where hackers sent thousands of phantom transactions to the exchange to slow its operations. Other exchanges experienced this problem as well, but were able to restore service more quickly. The hackers exploited a process used by some bitcoin exchanges that introduced "malleability" into the code governing transactions, experts said. Simply put, this allowed hackers to slightly alter the details of codes to create thousands of copies of transactions. These copies slowed the exchanges to a crawl, forcing them to independently verify each transaction to determine what was real and what was fake. "It was a well-known issue that every major exchange in the bitcoin community knew about and had solutions for. Mt. Gox did not," said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Robocoin, the world\'s first bitcoin ATM maker. Mt. Gox said on Friday that it had lost 750,000 of its users\' bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. At the current bitcoin price of about $565, that would total some $480 million - representing about 7 percent of the estimated global total of bitcoins. "There could be issues with security, with theft and so on, and there could be issues with the way things were implemented, where there\'s just some negligence and just some accidents and poor management of the exchange," said Moshe Cohen, assistant professor at Columbia Business School in New York. Mt. Gox said there was a discrepancy of 2.8 billion yen ($27.4 million) in its bank accounts when it checked on Monday. It had 127,000 creditors in bankruptcy, just over 1,000 of whom are Japanese. "First of all, I\'m very sorry," Karpeles, wearing a suit instead of his customary T-shirt, told a news conference in Tokyo on Friday. "The bitcoin industry is healthy and it is growing. It will continue, and reducing the impact is the most important point."

Gox. Internet criminals, security experts say, are attracted to\nbitcoin because of its stratospheric rise in value, because it\'s\neasier to steal than real money, and because it\'s easier to\ntrade with other criminal elements. But, they add, bitcoin will\nsurvive the damage. "It\'s just growing pains," says Keith Jarvis, a security\nresearcher at Dell SecureWorks. "Bitcoin is large enough and has\nenough momentum behind it to survive any public relations damage\nfrom this (Mt. Gox) case or anything else." The fall of Mt Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange which filed for\nbankruptcy last month after saying it lost some 850,000 bitcoins\nto hackers, is certainly the virtual currency\'s\nbiggest crisis. But data collated by Reuters from specialist bitcoin\nindustry websites and internet forums shows that more than\n730,000 bitcoins were already missing to theft, hacking,\ncyber-ransom payments and other apparently criminal pursuits\nbefore Mt. Gox\'s collapse. That\'s nearly 6 percent of all\nbitcoins, and doesn\'t include dozens, possibly hundreds, of\nunreported cases of individuals who have lost bitcoins from\ntheir computers or online exchanges to hackers. For sure, there\'s no way of telling who has these missing\nbitcoins, or whether they were converted to real money when the\nprice was much lower. And of course some bitcoins may have been\ncounted twice if criminals stole them from each other or they\nwere put back into circulation and stolen again. But there\'s no question that bitcoins have attracted the\nattention of cyber-criminals - as a currency and an asset worth\nstealing.    BEWARE MALWARE A study by Pat Litke and Joe Stewart of Dell SecureWorks\nshowed that as the price of bitcoin soared beyond $1,000 last\nyear, so did the number of viruses designed to steal bitcoins\nfrom wallets - programs that hold bitcoins on user\'s computers\nor smartphones. Of the 140 types of such software more than 100\nappeared in the past year. Writing such viruses, says Stewart, is easy. "There\'s no\nsophistication involved in the storage of bitcoin in wallets. As\nfor malware, it\'s some of the easiest stuff to write." Indeed, this cyber-pocket picking wasn\'t criminals\' first\nforay into bitcoins. Initially, they focused on using their\ncontrol of large networks of infected computers - called botnets\n- to make their own bitcoins. Bitcoins are created through a \'mining\' process where a\ncomputer\'s resources are used to perform millions of\ncalculations. For a while, says Kirill Levchenko, a researcher\nat the University of California, San Diego, criminals added\nmalware to their botnets to turn infected computers into bitcoin\nminers. This triggered predictions of doom for bitcoin - that the\ncriminals would take over the mining of bitcoin through botnets\nand bring the whole currency crashing down. But as bitcoins\nbecome harder to mine - according to an algorithm that slows\ndown their production the more people try to create them - this\napproach has proven less profitable. In 2012-13, says Danny Huang, another researcher at the\nUniversity of California, San Diego, they earned at least 4,500\nbitcoins, a relatively small sum compared with the total\nproduced. "Few botnets are mining bitcoins now," he said. Instead, they\'ve turned to stealing them from wallets, or,\nmore lucratively, from exchanges. According to data compiled last year by academics Tyler\nMoore and Nicholas Christin, of 40 exchanges tracked 18 had\nclosed, with customer balances wiped out in many cases - not\nalways, they point out, due to fraud. Since then, according to\npublic reports, more than a dozen others have been hacked.  CURRENCY OF THIEVES Cyber-criminals have also made use of the ease with which\nbitcoins can be traded without any third party - such as a bank\nor online payments service like PayPal - to use it as at least\none way of paying for services between themselves. "Bitcoin made it much easier for them, because they have to\ntrust each other even less. Even complete strangers can\ncooperate," said Juraj Bednar, a bitcoin security expert in\nSlovakia. But while bitcoin has its advantages, it\'s not a perfect\ntool for the bad guys. Take, for example, ransomware. Viruses which encrypt users\'\ndata and then demand payment for a key to unlock it have become\nincreasingly sophisticated, says Dell Secureworks\' Jarvis. The most successful: CryptoLocker, which Jarvis believes is\nrun by a Russian-speaking gang who are also behind a botnet\ncalled Gameover Zeus that targets financial websites. Bitcoin often appears on CryptoLocker as an option for\nvictims to pay up. Its appeal, says Bednar, lies in the fact\nthat it needs no third party for the transaction to work. But there have been problems. For one thing, the type of\nuser to be infected by a virus wasn\'t likely to be the type who\nis technologically savvy enough to be familiar with bitcoin.\nAlso, as bitcoin rose in value, it has become a more expensive\noption for the victim, forcing the criminals to lower their\nbitcoin ransom demands to match prevailing exchange rates.  TRACING TRANSACTIONS Then there\'s bitcoin\'s transparency. All transactions are\nvisible, and while they\'re just digits and letters, in theory\nthey could be connected to an individual and the entire history\nof all the bitcoin\'s transactions traced. Italian computer engineer Michele Spagnuolo, for example,\nwas able to trace a number of ransom payments for CryptoLocker.\nThe gains have been impressive: he and academics from\nPolitecnico di Milano speculate that up to 6,757 bitcoins - then\nworth around $6 million - could be linked to those behind\nCryptoLocker late last year. That estimate of their total\ntakings, he says, could be very conservative. But the fact that such payments can be traced would raise a\nred flag for cyber-criminals, says Daniel Cohen of RSA, the\nsecurity division of EMC Corp, even though there are\nonline services that can "launder" bitcoins to hide their\norigin. "Sure, there are bitcoin laundering services, but still\nif I tie a wallet to an identity I can see every single\nmovement," he said. And, ironically, the success that some criminals have had in\nstealing bitcoins has made it less appealing to the\nunderworld. RSA\'s Cohen says his team monitoring underground\nforums has noticed criminals lately see bitcoin as "volatile,\nseizable and, with the recent thefts, unsafe."  FIXES NEEDED That\'s not to say bitcoin is out of the woods. While the protocols underlying bitcoin have proved\nthemselves to work, the weak links have been the software\ncontaining the wallets, whether on exchanges or on individuals\'\ncomputers. "The attacks on the exchanges did not in themselves indicate\nany particular weakness of bitcoin per se, but rather exploiting\nvulnerabilities within the exchanges," says Raj Samani of Intel\nCorp\'s internet security company McAfee. Such holes are being addressed, says Dell Secureworks\'\nStewart, pointing to such innovations as hardware wallets to\nreplace software ones.

Gox, other bitcoin exchanges, and businesses that deal in bitcoin to seek information on how they handled recent cyber attacks, a source familiar with the probe said on Wednesday. In the attacks - known as distributed denial of service attacks - hackers overwhelmed bitcoin exchanges by sending thousands of phantom transactions. At least three exchanges were forced to halt withdrawals of bitcoins on February 7, including Mt. Gox, which was the largest at the time. Mt. Gox never resumed service before going dormant on Tuesday, leaving customers unable to recover their funds. [ID:nL3N0LU1OX] The Tokyo-based company\'s chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said earlier on Wednesday that he is working with others to solve the problems. "As there is a lot of speculation regarding Mt Gox and its future, I would like to use this opportunity to reassure everyone that I am still in Japan, and working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues," Karpeles said in a statement posted on the Mt. Gox website. A spokesman for Bharara declined to comment. Bitcoin, a form of electronic money independent of traditional banking, relies on a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction that is made. At current prices, the bitcoin market is worth about $7 billion. Investors deposit their bitcoins in digital wallets at specific exchanges, so the Mt. Gox shutdown is similar to a bank closing its doors - people cannot retrieve their funds. While proponents of bitcoin hail its anonymity and lack of ties to traditional banking, regulators have become increasingly interested in the digital currency due to its usage by criminal elements and its volatile nature. It has been a rough month for bitcoin investors, with cyber attacks on several exchanges, a sharp fall in bitcoin\'s value, and rising pressure from regulators. Bitcoin\'s price varies by exchange, but the losses were most dramatic on Mt. Gox, where it fell to about $135 from $828.99 before February 7. "Mt Gox has been broken and it was obvious there was something really bad going on there for nearly a year. They were processing withdrawals very slowly and generally being very opaque about what was going on there," said Mike Hearn, a bitcoin developer in Zurich, Switzerland. A second source familiar with the case said U.S. federal law enforcement is investigating Mt. Gox. A third source said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was monitoring the situation. Japan\'s Finance Ministry and police are also looking into the abrupt closure of Mt. Gox, according to the Japanese government\'s top spokesman. "MALLEABILITY" Bitcoin has gained increasing acceptance as a method of payment and has attracted a number of prominent venture capital investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. The digital currency has also caught the eye of hackers. The recent cyber attacks exploited a process used by some bitcoin exchanges that introduced "malleability" into the code governing transactions, experts said. Simply put, this allowed hackers to slightly alter the details of codes to create thousands of copies of transactions. These copies slowed the exchanges to a crawl, forcing them to independently verify each transaction to determine what was real and what was fake. A document circulating on the Internet purporting to be a crisis plan for Mt. Gox, said more than 744,000 bitcoins were "missing due to malleability-related theft," and noted Mt. Gox had $174 million in liabilities against $32.75 million in assets. It was not possible to verify the document. If accurate, that would mean approximately 6 percent of the 12.4 million bitcoins minted would be considered missing. According to a Bloomberg report, the federal probe was spurred by information provided by the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the digital currency. The Bitcoin Foundation could not be reached immediately for comment. Mt. Gox\'s CEO Karpeles, one of the founding members of the foundation, resigned from the foundation\'s board on February 24. Developers are working on fixes to bitcoin\'s software to guard against cyber attacks, though many larger service providers have already implemented such changes, according to Gregory Maxwell, one of the bitcoin software\'s core developers. He said some malleability in the software protocol was necessary - for example, in transactions where multiple people can put in money, but the transaction is not valid until enough funds are contributed. "None of these fixes are especially complicated, but because the correctness of the software is important we use a conservative release process that avoids rushing anything out," Maxwell said, adding that the bulk of the recent work on the software is being done by four people. BITSTAMP Jacob Dienelt, who trades bitcoins and sells paper bitcoin wallets, said people he knows in the bitcoin community in New York stopped using Mt. Gox when the exchange halted dollar withdrawals several months ago and said all withdrawals had to be in bitcoin. Dienelt said has not been subpoenaed. With Mt. Gox\'s shutdown, Bitstamp has handled the most volume in the last two days, with more than 165,000 U.S. dollar transactions, according to Bitcoincharts. Bitstamp had temporarily halted customer withdrawals earlier this month, citing "inconsistent results" and blaming a denial-of-service attack. The price of bitcoin was lately at $588 on Bitstamp, up about 7 percent on the day. "Right now is a sweet buying opportunity. I don\'t think you\'re going to see bitcoin go this low for awhile - if ever again," said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Robocoin, which launched the world\'s first Bitcoin ATM in Vancouver, Canada, in the fall. "The more that bitcoin is on the front pages, the more that people are discussing it and educating one another, the better for the currency." Kelley said Robocoin has not been subpoenaed in the U.S. regulatory probe; nor has New York-based exchange Coinsetter, according to a spokesperson. Bitstamp did not respond to requests for comment.

The attack, which is technically known as a distributed denial of service attack, involved thousands of phantom transactions, forcing at least three of the online platforms that store bitcoins and trade them for traditional currencies to halt withdrawals of bitcoins until they can determine which transactions were real. It showed that bitcoin, which exists solely in cyberspace and operates on a software code written by an unknown programmer or group of programmers, is as vulnerable to such an assault as any other Internet-based business. It exposes the higher risks involved in owning and trading the instrument compared with the dollar and other traditional currencies. Bitcoins slumped in value as a result of the disruptions. "Bitcoin is still an experimental protocol in its infancy," said Micky Malka, a venture capitalist who is on the board of Bitcoin\'s trade group, the Bitcoin Foundation. "It will grow and mature over time," he added. "No one should be investing an amount they cannot afford to lose." This week\'s attack was not the first, said Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer for blockchain.info, a website that tracks bitcoin activity and provides online storage services for bitcoin users. Antonopoulos is also a member of a group of core bitcoin programmers and is part of an emergency response team of programmers who have been working to fix the flaws in the code governing some bitcoin transactions that the attackers were exploiting. He said that work that should be completed by the middle of next week, echoing an estimate provided by a spokeswoman for the Bitcoin Foundation who said its core developers were all participating in the effort to fix the code. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital system of value transfers that is not governed by any central bank, company or government. No assets back the bitcoin, whose value has fluctuated widely as its visibility has increased. Last September, a bitcoin was worth around $150. By late December the value was near the $1,000 mark. Regulators around the world are struggling how to categorize the bitcoin. Some want to call it an asset class, others a commodity. Bitcoin users call it a currency and many advocate for its mass adoption, claiming it can help solve problems created by expensive and time-consuming bank transactions. Early adopters also liked the anonymity bitcoin has offered, since it can be transferred between users without any exchange of personal identification information. However, moves by various authorities to pursue bitcoin users who they say have laundered money using the currency and attempts to regulate bitcoin exchanges could soon lower the level of anonymity in transactions. On Tuesday, Slovenia-based Bitstamp became the second major bitcoin exchange to halt customer withdrawals in the past several days, citing "inconsistent results" and blaming a denial-of-service attack. That was a day after Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo and the best-known digital marketplace operator, said a halt on withdrawals would continue indefinitely. Traders reacted to the halt by sending the bitcoin value to its lowest level in nearly two months. A Bulgaria-based bitcoin exchange also had to halt withdrawals, Antonopoulos said. The price of bitcoins, which have gained wider acceptance in recent months, dropped in the wake of the attacks from around $850 late last month. On Wednesday, they were quoted down nearly 2 percent for the day at $656 per coin on the bitcoin tracking website CoinDesk. "Anyone who plays in this space, you better have a plan for when an attack happens because it\'s going to be a when, not an if," said Brian Krebs, a Washington-based cyber security expert who runs the blog KrebsOnSecurity.com. The lesson for investors was that the bitcoin wasn\'t as liquid as initially advertised, said Jason Scharfman, a financial due diligence expert and managing partner at consulting firm Corgentum. "These types of attacks, they\'re effectively freezing some of the accounts because the exchanges don\'t want to pay out to the wrong person," he said. "If something\'s frozen or there\'s a question about me being able to redeem my bitcoins, the value of them drops." "Does this spook financial investors?" he added. "The answer is yes." Scharfman said one way to mitigate the risks of such attacks would be to spread holdings of bitcoins out among several different online storage facilities. That way if one were attacked the other might still have a chance at being safe. Scharfman said the more regulatory scrutiny that bitcoin exchanges received, the safer they were likely to be. "Regulation will sort of normalize which exchanges are the most secure. They\'ll mandate security measures and smaller exchanges just won\'t be able to afford it," he said.

CCEDK offered the service last week, hoping for $45,000 a day in turnover within six months in a market which has 20,000 active users, according to the exchange which itself was only established in May.  The majority of the trades in NXT - which is similar to Bitcoin - taking place over the past three days were to sell the cryptocurrency for dollars, according to the website of CCEDK, a Danish company based in a small town called Blokhus in the far north of the country. It remains to be seen how virtual coins will develop after a boom in bitcoins was hit by a collapse of the biggest exchange.  While the start to trade has been modest, NXT rose against the dollar to just over 5 cents on Monday from 4.5 cents on Friday, increasing its market capitalization to $51 million from $45 million, the coinmarketcap.com website showed. NXT is now the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, moving from fourth on Friday, but is still a long way away from the $8.1 billion bitcoin market and even second largest market of Litecoin at $260 million. CCEDK\'s chief executive and founder said he was pleased with progress over the weekend because the exchange had managed to double its NXT users, even if so many trades had not occurred.

Gox, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, abruptly stopped trading on Tuesday and its chief executive said the business was at "a turning point," sparking concerns about the future of the unregulated virtual currency. Several other digital currency exchanges and prominent early-stage investors in bitcoin responded with forceful statements in an attempt to reassure investors of both bitcoin\'s viability and their own security protocols. The website of Mt. Gox suddenly went dark on Tuesday with no explanation, and the company\'s Tokyo office was empty - the only activity was outside, where a handful of protesters said they had lost money investing in the virtual currency. Hours later, Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles told Reuters in an email: "We should have an official announcement ready soon-ish. We are currently at a turning point for the business. I can\'t tell much more for now as this also involves other parties." He did not elaborate on the details or give his location. Bitcoin has gained increasing acceptance as a method of payment and has attracted a number of large venture capital investors. At a current price of about $517, the total bitcoins in circulation are worth approximately $6.4 billion. Investors deposit their bitcoins in digital wallets at specific exchanges, so the Mt. Gox shutdown is similar to a bank closing its doors - people cannot retrieve their funds. A document circulating on the Internet purporting to be a crisis plan for Mt. Gox, said more than 744,000 bitcoins were "missing due to malleability-related theft", and noted Mt. Gox had $174 million in liabilities against $32.75 million in assets. It was not possible to verify the document or the exchange\'s financial situation. If accurate, that would mean approximately 6 percent of the 12.4 million bitcoins minted would be considered missing. A statement on Bitcoin\'s website said, "In the event of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox\'s operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly." The digital currency has caught the eye of regulators concerned with consumer protections and bitcoin\'s use in money laundering. Benjamin M. Lawsky, Superintendent of Financial Services for the State of New York, said in a statement, that while all of the facts surrounding Mt. Gox are "not yet clear, these developments underscore that smart, tailored regulation could play an important role in protecting consumers and the security of the money that they entrust to virtual currency firms." Lawsky said last month that he planned to issue rules for businesses handling virtual currencies. SECURITY QUESTIONS Mt. Gox halted withdrawals earlier this month after it said it detected "unusual activity on its bitcoin wallets and performed investigations during the past weeks." The move pushed bitcoin prices down to their lowest level in nearly two months. Even with the halt on February 7, Mt. Gox still handled more transactions than any other in the past month. Over the last 30 days, Mt. Gox has handled more than one million bitcoin transactions denominated in dollars, or about 34 percent of activity, according to Bitcoincharts, which provides data and charts for the bitcoin network. Critics of the exchange, from rivals to burned investors, said the digital marketplace operator had long been lax over its security. Investors in bitcoin, who have endured a volatile ride in the value of the unregulated cyber-tender, said they still had faith in the currency despite the problems at Mt. Gox. "Mt. Gox is one of several exchanges, and their exit, while unfortunate, opens a door of opportunity," The Bitcoin Foundation, the digital currency\'s trade group, said in a statement. "This incident demonstrates the need for responsible individuals and members of the bitcoin community to lead in providing reliable services." United Kingdom-based Bitstamp, the second-largest bitcoin exchange by volume, said on its website that it had done an audit of its systems and that it was not subject to the same kind of "malleability" that "was apparently exploited at Mt. Gox." Similarly, BTC-E, another exchange, assured investors that it has "no vulnerabilities during client transactions." "VERY ANGRY" Bitcoin has been a roller-coaster of late, rising and falling dramatically, sometimes on an intraday basis, and its price varies greatly depending on the exchange. The program that runs the currency has been the target of hackers disrupting transactions recently. The Mt. Gox bitcoin, which traded at $828.99 before February 7, when the exchange halted withdrawals, since plunged 83.7 percent to $135. At Bitstamp, the price hit a low of $400 on Tuesday, down 40 percent since February 7. It had recovered lately to $517. Bitstamp has had more than 800,000 U.S. dollar transactions in the last 30 days, according to Bitcoincharts. In the last two days, Bitstamp has handled more volume than Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox was a founding member and one of the three elected industry representatives on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation. A bitcoin exchange since 2010, Mt. Gox is a relatively old player, having grown quickly when there were few alternatives. On Sunday Karpeles resigned from the Foundation\'s board. "I\'m very angry," said Kolin Burges, a self-styled "crypto-currency trader" and former software engineer who came from London for answers after Mt. Gox did not tell him what happened to his bitcoins, which at one point were worth $300,000. Six leading bitcoin exchanges - which allow users to trade bitcoins for U.S. dollars and other currencies - distanced themselves from Mt. Gox. "This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company\'s actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry," the companies - Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, BTC China, Blockchain and Circle - said in the statement. "As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we\'re seeing today." Venture capitalists, many of whom have invested in bitcoin and related services, jumped to bitcoin\'s defense. Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures and a backer of Coinbase, which allows consumers to easily buy and sell bitcoins with wallets directly connected to their bank accounts, wrote in a blog post that part of the maturation of a sector "will inevitably be failures, crashes, and other messes." "The wonderful thing about a globally distributed financial network is that if one of the nodes goes down, it doesn\'t take the system down," he wrote, adding that he had bought some bitcoin on Tuesday. "I always feel good buying when there is blood in the streets in any market." Marc Andreessen, whose venture capital firm has invested millions in bitcoin ventures, told CNBC that other exchanges are doing fine. In Boston, Kyle Powers and Chris Yim, co-founders of Liberty Teller, a company that operates a bitcoin automated teller machine, answered customers\' questions at their kiosk in South Station Tuesday. Yim said he expects a price dip in bitcoin, but no long-term problems with the currency. TEETHING PROBLEMS Virtual currency exchanges "stand to benefit from the Mt. Gox fallout," but there will be "increased expectations on the transparency and disclosures they need to make to customers," said Jaron Lukasiewicz, co-founder and chief executive of Coinsetter, a New York-based bitcoin exchange. Steve Hudak, spokesman for Treasury\'s anti-money laundering unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), said it is "aware of the reports regarding Mt. Gox" but had no additional comment. To date it is the only U.S. regulatory agency to have any oversight of Mt. Gox. Democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Mt. Gox "is a reminder of the damage potentially ill equipped and unregulated financial actors can wreak on unsuspecting consumers. U.S. policymakers and regulators can and should learn from this incident to protect consumers." Karpeles himself, while insisting on his own exchange\'s reliability, has made no secret that bitcoin is, as he told Reuters last April, a "high-risk investment." "If you buy bitcoins, you should buy keeping in mind that the value could be zero the day after." The concierge at his home - an upscale apartment in the Shibuya district - said he was not answering his intercom. His mailbox was so stuffed with mail that the flap would not close.

The program that\nruns the currency has been the target of hackers disrupting\ntransactions recently. The Mt. Gox bitcoin, which traded at $828.99 before Feb. 7,\nwhen the exchange halted withdrawals, since plunged 83.7 percent\nto $135. At Bitstamp, the price hit a low of $400 on Tuesday, down 40\npercent since Feb. 7. It had recovered lately to $517. Bitstamp has had more than 800,000 U.S. dollar transactions\nin the last 30 days, according to Bitcoincharts. In the last two\ndays, Bitstamp has handled more volume than Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox was a founding member and one of the three elected\nindustry representatives on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.\nA bitcoin exchange since 2010, Mt. Gox is a relatively old\nplayer, having grown quickly when there were few alternatives.  On Sunday Karpeles resigned from the Foundation\'s board. "I\'m very angry," said Kolin Burges, a self-styled\n"crypto-currency trader" and former software engineer who came\nfrom London for answers after Mt. Gox did not tell him what\nhappened to his bitcoins, which at one point were worth\n$300,000. Six leading bitcoin exchanges - which allow users to trade\nbitcoins for U.S. dollars and other currencies - distanced\nthemselves from Mt. Gox. "This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was\nthe result of one company\'s actions and does not reflect the\nresilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency\nindustry," the companies - Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, BTC\nChina, Blockchain and Circle - said in the statement. "As with\nany new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be\nweeded out, and that is what we\'re seeing today." Venture capitalists, many of whom have invested in bitcoin\nand related services, jumped to bitcoin\'s defense. Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures and a backer\nof Coinbase, which allows consumers to easily buy and sell\nbitcoins with wallets directly connected to their bank accounts,\nwrote in a blog post that part of the maturation of a sector\n"will inevitably be failures, crashes, and other messes." "The wonderful thing about a globally distributed financial\nnetwork is that if one of the nodes goes down, it doesn\'t take\nthe system down," he wrote, adding that he had bought some\nbitcoin on Tuesday. "I always feel good buying when there is\nblood in the streets in any market." Marc Andreessen, whose venture capital firm has invested\nmillions in bitcoin ventures, told CNBC that other exchanges are\ndoing fine. In Boston, Kyle Powers and Chris Yim, co-founders of Liberty\nTeller, a company that operates a bitcoin automated teller\nmachine, answered customers\' questions at their kiosk in South\nStation Tuesday. Yim said he expects a price dip in bitcoin, but\nno long-term problems with the currency.  TEETHING PROBLEMS Virtual currency exchanges "stand to benefit from the Mt.\nGox fallout," but there will be "increased expectations on the\ntransparency and disclosures they need to make to customers,"\nsaid Jaron Lukasiewicz, co-founder and chief executive of\nCoinsetter, a New York-based bitcoin exchange. Steve Hudak, spokesman for Treasury\'s anti-money laundering\nunit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), said it\nis "aware of the reports regarding Mt. Gox" but had no\nadditional comment. To date it is the only U.S. regulatory\nagency to have any oversight of Mt. Gox. Democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, who chairs the\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a\nstatement that Mt. Gox "is a reminder of the damage potentially\nill equipped and unregulated financial actors can wreak on\nunsuspecting consumers. U.S. policymakers and regulators can and\nshould learn from this incident to protect consumers." Karpeles himself, while insisting on his own exchange\'s\nreliability, has made no secret that bitcoin is, as he told\nReuters last April, a "high-risk investment." "If you buy bitcoins, you should buy keeping in mind that\nthe value could be zero the day after." The concierge at his home - an upscale apartment in the\nShibuya district - said he was not answering his intercom.

Gox, other bitcoin exchanges,\nand businesses that deal in bitcoin to seek information on how\nthey handled recent cyber attacks, a source familiar with the\nprobe said on Wednesday. In the attacks - known as distributed denial of service\nattacks - hackers overwhelmed bitcoin exchanges by sending\nthousands of phantom transactions. At least three exchanges were\nforced to halt withdrawals of bitcoins on Feb. 7, including Mt.\nGox, which was the largest at the time. Mt. Gox never resumed service before going dormant on\nTuesday, leaving customers unable to recover their funds.\n The Tokyo-based company\'s chief executive, Mark\nKarpeles, said earlier on Wednesday that he is working with\nothers to solve the problems. "As there is a lot of speculation regarding Mt Gox and its\nfuture, I would like to use this opportunity to reassure\neveryone that I am still in Japan, and working very hard with\nthe support of different parties to find a solution to our\nrecent issues," Karpeles said in a statement posted on the Mt.\nGox website. A spokesman for Bharara declined to comment. Bitcoin, a form of electronic money independent of\ntraditional banking, relies on a network of computers that solve\ncomplex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies\nand permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction\nthat is made. At current prices, the bitcoin market is worth\nabout $7 billion. Investors deposit their bitcoins in digital wallets at\nspecific exchanges, so the Mt. Gox shutdown is similar to a bank\nclosing its doors - people cannot retrieve their funds. While proponents of bitcoin hail its anonymity and lack of\nties to traditional banking, regulators have become increasingly\ninterested in the digital currency due to its usage by criminal\nelements and its volatile nature. It has been a rough month for bitcoin investors, with cyber\nattacks on several exchanges, a sharp fall in bitcoin\'s value,\nand rising pressure from regulators. Bitcoin\'s price varies by\nexchange, but the losses were most dramatic on Mt. Gox, where it\nfell to about $135 from $828.99 before Feb. 7. "Mt Gox has been broken and it was obvious there was\nsomething really bad going on there for nearly a year. They were\nprocessing withdrawals very slowly and generally being very\nopaque about what was going on there," said Mike Hearn, a\nbitcoin developer in Zurich, Switzerland. A second source familiar with the case said U.S. federal law\nenforcement is investigating Mt. Gox. A third source said the\nU.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was monitoring the\nsituation. Japan\'s Finance Ministry and police are also looking into\nthe abrupt closure of Mt. Gox, according to the Japanese\ngovernment\'s top spokesman.   "MALLEABILITY" Bitcoin has gained increasing acceptance as a method of\npayment and has attracted a number of prominent venture capital\ninvestors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square\nVentures. The digital currency has also caught the eye of hackers. The\nrecent cyber attacks exploited a process used by some bitcoin\nexchanges that introduced "malleability" into the code governing\ntransactions, experts said. Simply put, this allowed hackers to slightly alter the\ndetails of codes to create thousands of copies of transactions.\nThese copies slowed the exchanges to a crawl, forcing them to\nindependently verify each transaction to determine what was real\nand what was fake. A document circulating on the Internet purporting to be a\ncrisis plan for Mt. Gox, said more than 744,000 bitcoins were\n"missing due to malleability-related theft," and noted Mt. Gox\nhad $174 million in liabilities against $32.75 million in\nassets. It was not possible to verify the document. If accurate, that would mean approximately 6 percent of the\n12.4 million bitcoins minted would be considered missing. According to a Bloomberg report, the federal probe was\nspurred by information provided by the Bitcoin Foundation, an\nadvocacy group for the digital currency. The Bitcoin Foundation could not be reached immediately for\ncomment. Mt. Gox\'s CEO Karpeles, one of the founding members of\nthe foundation, resigned from the foundation\'s board on Feb. 24. Developers are working on fixes to bitcoin\'s software to\nguard against cyber attacks, though many larger service\nproviders have already implemented such changes, according to\nGregory Maxwell, one of the bitcoin software\'s core developers. He said some malleability in the software protocol was\nnecessary - for example, in transactions where multiple people\ncan put in money, but the transaction is not valid until enough\nfunds are contributed. "None of these fixes are especially complicated, but because\nthe correctness of the software is important we use a\nconservative release process that avoids rushing anything out,"\nMaxwell said, adding that the bulk of the recent work on the\nsoftware is being done by four people.  BITSTAMP Jacob Dienelt, who trades bitcoins and sells paper bitcoin\nwallets, said people he knows in the bitcoin community in New\nYork stopped using Mt. Gox when the exchange halted dollar\nwithdrawals several months ago and said all withdrawals had to\nbe in bitcoin. Dienelt said has not been subpoenaed. With Mt.

Bitcoin is not backed by any government or central bank, a digital currency whose value can swing dramatically based on demand. Users can transfer bitcoins to each other online and store the currency in digital "wallets." Jeremy Rubin, a sophomore, and Dan Elitzer, an MBA candidate, raised half a million dollars from alumni and other sources to fund the experiment after coming up with the idea last month. The extra money will go toward infrastructure and education and the offer may eventually be extended to other students beyond undergrads. "MIT\'s campus will become a place where bitcoin is more widely used than anywhere else in the world," said Elitzer, who is president of the MIT Bitcoin Club. But not all bitcoin ventures have been a success. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, filed in February for bankruptcy protection in Japan, saying it may have lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of the virtual coins due to hacking of its computer system. To avoid such problems, the students have sought help from MIT computer scientists and staff as well as organizations that facilitate digital currency payments. "We are going to make sure this is done in a secure fashion," Elitzer told Reuters. "We are making sure we get the right expertise in here." The bulk of the funding for the project came from MIT alumni. Alexander Morcos, class of 1997 and co-founder of the New York-based high-frequency trading firm Hudson River Trading LLC, donated about $250,000, the students said. Rubin said he believed that giving classmates digital currencies was similar to providing Web access in the early days of the Internet. While anybody can exchange digital currencies from a computer, most bitcoin users are isolated from each other. By issuing bitcoin to every undergrad on campus, Elitzer and Rubin hope it will encourage them to exchange it between each other as well. "There are virtual communities where it has been common to find bitcoin users, but there has been no physical, geographic location where you can go to and assume that a significant proportion of the population knows what bitcoin is and uses it," he said. "You will have a critical mass. The assumption will be that the other person has it," he said. It will be an opt-in program, which means that students will not automatically be issued digital wallets, but won\'t get any money if they reject the digital currency. "We\'re planning on bitcoin or bust," Rubin said.

Gox was once the world\'s leading exchange for trading the digital currency, but shut its website earlier this year after saying that in a hacking attack it lost some 850,000 bitcoins, worth more than $500 million at current prices. The firm later said it found 200,000 bitcoins. Brown, a Democrat, in his office\'s written announcement did not comment on the currency bill he had signed into law along with other legislation. An analysis of the bill prepared for lawmakers mentions "community currencies", which are created by members of a local area along with participating merchants and are sometimes designed as a protest of U.S. monetary policies, among the forms of alternative payment methods now in use in certain parts of the United States. The U.S. Marshals Service on Friday auctioned off about 30,000 bitcoins seized during a raid on Silk Road, an Internet black-market bazaar where authorities say illegal drugs and other goods could be bought.

Numerous companies in the United States enable customers to\npay for goods and services in virtual currencies. But since\nbitcoins are not regulated by the federal government, users face\na maze of rules in the 50 states. "We may be looking at some type of model definitions, or\nmodel laws or regulations, and very likely recommendations to\neither our federal colleagues or to Congress," David Cotney,\nMassachusetts Commissioner of Banks, told Reuters on the\nsidelines of a public hearing into the issue on Friday. Cotney was appointed in February to head the new Emerging\nPayments Task Force, a group of nine members of the Conference\nof State Bank Supervisors (CSBS). He said the task force had\ngiven itself roughly a year to complete the task. The task force was hoping for a clearer definition of which\noperators needed to be regulated and which ones did not, Cotney\nsaid in the interview. "Who\'s in and who\'s out? So if we can offer that (it) would\nbe a ... big step," he said. Cotney\'s group also looks at other\nnew payment technologies, such as mobile phone payments, and\nPayPal, an online money transfer service. Bitcoin is the most prominent of a group of so-called\nvirtual currencies created by computers and governed by the\nBitcoin Foundation, outside the control of any government. Some\nretailers accept bitcoins as payment on the Internet or in\nshops. But recent mishaps have brought the technology under\nheightened scrutiny. Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange,\nfiled for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million\nworth of client bitcoins. State regulators say they will not stand in the way of\nvirtual currency operators entering their states, but they want\nto ensure the business is safe. Task force member Benjamin Lawksy, the New York\nSuperintendent of Financial Services, in January said his\ndepartment was working on a "BitLicense". California is another\nstate that has shown interest. So far, federal regulators have been relatively mum. The\nDepartment of the Treasury\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement\nNetwork (FinCEN) last year classified administrators or\nexchangers of bitcoin as money transmitters, which puts them\nunder the remit of state regulators.

Gox isn\'t bothering Anthony Hope and others who have ditched steady careers in government and finance to build bitcoin companies - and who stand to lose money they have in Mt. Gox. Hope, a former British Treasury official and now head of compliance at Hong Kong-based MatrixVision, says that while Mt. Gox\'s fate is unclear, its troubles form part of a wider shift as more professional players move into the bitcoin mainstream. "It\'s good for us as a business, not so good for us as consumers," he said. "Over the longer term it will be good for bitcoin because over time the entire ecosystem will be made more robust." Steve Beauregard, CEO and founder of Singapore-based GoCoin, is more blunt about Mt. Gox\'s woes: "It\'s important in the sense of sweeping away a lot of the early unsophisticated folk who got into this and made a name for themselves, but didn\'t have the management horsepower to manage a company." Mt. Gox, at one time the biggest bitcoin exchange, abruptly stopped trading this week amid reports on the internet that more than 744,000 bitcoins - worth around $380 million at prevailing rates - had been stolen. If accurate, that would mean around 6 percent of the world\'s 12.4 million bitcoins minted would be missing. The exchange\'s CEO Mark Karpeles told Reuters in an email that his company was "at a turning point" and would issue a statement "soon-ish." His LinkedIn profile reads: "I have a long experience in company creation, and experienced almost any imaginable kind of trouble." On Wednesday, Japan said its authorities were looking into the Mt. Gox closure, and The Wall Street Journal reported that the virtual currency\'s exchange had received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in New York. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\'s office in Manhattan did not respond to requests for comment. Also, the European Banking Authority warned bitcoin users they were on their own when it comes to losses from using unregulated online currencies, noting there is no safety net as with mainstream bank deposits. "Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the EU that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business," it said in a statement. Bitcoins rallied more than 10 percent on Wednesday, trading at close to $580, according to coinorama.net, which tracks the rate on various exchanges. "FINANCE HAS GOT BORING" While bitcoin\'s public image remains one of a network of subversive, libertarian geeks, the past year or so has seen a change in the kind of people launching start-ups, say Hope, Beauregard and others in the fledgling industry. Hope\'s colleagues, for example, include a serial entrepreneur, a former Morgan Stanley mergers and acquisitions specialist and a respected figure from the bitcoin community. Hope handled banking policy, taxation rules and freezing suspected terrorists\' assets for the UK government before he moved to Hong Kong. Antony Lewis, meanwhile, joined Singapore-based bitcoin exchange itBit from Credit Suisse last November. His colleagues include a former hedge fund analyst, a venture capitalist who invested in IT start-ups on behalf of the Singapore government and a former forex spot trader. "Finance has got boring in the past five years," Lewis said. "It\'s not fun, it\'s very backward looking and all the innovation is in virtual currencies." Such companies are examples of a maturing - not just of the kinds of people attracted to bitcoin, but of the specialist roles companies play in the nascent bitcoin ecosystem. MatrixVision, for example, helps bitcoin exchanges integrate with the traditional banking system by complying with local laws and regulations, while GoCoin acts as a "PayPal for bitcoin users", allowing merchants and others to accept bitcoins without the problems of currency volatility and security risk. MORE DISCERNING USERS For sure, the crisis surrounding Mt. Gox is the worst the young crypto-currency has faced, damaging trust and challenging all bitcoin-related companies to respond. "Other major players need to show they avoid the mistakes Mt. Gox made, which they are trying hard to do," said Tomas Forgac, who founded Singapore-based Coin Of Sale, a service for merchants to accept bitcoins as payment. That, adds Masa Nakatsu, a Japanese entrepreneur who this month founded his own bitcoin start-up, means bringing in more professional technology companies which are able to work with governments and central banks - a skill he says some of the early bitcoin players have not shown. "Players will change," he says, "as the characteristics of the market change." This shake-out is already underway as users learn to be more discerning about where to put or exchange their money. ItBiT\'s Lewis says his exchange has seen a steady flow of funds and new accounts, with trading jumping to 10 times normal levels in just the past few days. "ItBit represents the next wave of exchanges where we care about customers and want to have a go at this," he says. Lewis points to key questions that users need to ask of exchanges before entrusting money to them: how easy are they to hack? How well capitalised is the company? Are the deposits insured? ItBit, he says, ticks most of those boxes. Clients\' bitcoin funds are held on a computer that\'s not connected to the internet, and doesn\'t even have a hard drive or network card. Only itBit\'s funds are used for transactions. It has reached out to auditing firms to inspect its procedures and holds regular meetings with global regulators. Such things aren\'t cheap, says Lewis, noting ItBit has raised $5.5 million "and we\'ll need more as regulation gets tighter." "The next generation of bitcoin companies will be run by people with previous experience of financial service companies and they will need to be capitalised like financial service companies," he says. "VIBRANT ECOSYSTEM" Beauregard, who divides his time between his Singapore start-up and his California home, says financing this won\'t be a problem. His GoCoin has raised $500,000 and is about to close out another round of funding. While the number of bitcoin companies raising six figure sums is limited, that will change, he said. "Every venture capital firm will have to have their bitcoin plays in 2014," he said. "Otherwise they\'ll be missing the single greatest asset class that\'s emerging at the moment." Hakim Mamoni, Hong Kong-based chief technology officer at bitcoin incubator Seedcoin, says a new raft of exchanges are set to appear in the months ahead. He declined to identify them, since most are operating in what the start-up world calls \'stealth mode.\' "That\'s why the Mt. Gox event is not troubling me," he said.

Gox agitated for proof that the Tokyo-based firm was still solvent after a hacking attack, CEO Mark Karpeles turned to the comedy science fiction novel "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy". During an online chat, Karpeles moved the equivalent of $170 million in bitcoin at today\'s market rates - the virtual equivalent of a bank manager flashing a wad of cash in a wallet to establish credit. The gesture - with a sly wink to the "geek" culture Karpeles believed he shared with many of his 50,000 customers at the time, including an interest in coding, Japanese manga comics and science fiction - succeeded. By moving 424,242 bitcoins, Karpeles, then 26, evoked the random number, 42, described as the "meaning of life" in Douglas Adams\' sci-fi novel. "Don\'t come after me claiming we have no coins," Karpeles said, according to a transcript of that online discussion. "42 is the answer." As the price of bitcoin soared from a few dollars to above $1,000, Mt. Gox grew to become the world\'s largest exchange for the digital currency, handling flows worth $3 billion in 2013, by the company\'s own reckoning. But even as Mt. Gox boomed, French-born Karpeles seemed both keen to maintain total control of key operations and indifferent to commercial success, according to former staff and associates who spoke to Reuters, but asked not to be named because of ongoing investigations into the exchange\'s collapse. Creditors who want to know how Mt. Gox at one point lost some $500 million worth of bitcoin and another $27 million in cash from its bank accounts, are seeking answers from Karpeles, who has spent recent days huddled in meetings with lawyers in Tokyo. Mt. Gox and its lawyers declined repeated requests for comment for this article. Lawyers for Karpeles told a U.S. judge last week that he was "not willing" to travel to the United States - as ordered by the judge to answer questions in a bankruptcy court - until his attorneys can "get up to speed" on a new subpoena from the U.S. Treasury Department. Karpeles doesn\'t want to go to the U.S. as he fears he could be arrested by authorities there, a person familiar with his thinking said. "Regardless of whether it was a massive fraud or whether he was just grossly negligent, at the end of the day he\'s at fault," said Steven Woodrow, a lawyer representing a U.S. class action against Karpeles brought by Mt. Gox creditors. Mt. Gox\'s bid to resuscitate its business was dismissed by a Tokyo court on Wednesday, and the court-appointed administrator said that meant the firm was likely to be liquidated. He added that Karpeles was likely to be investigated for liability in the exchange\'s collapse. THE MAGICAL TUX In its bankruptcy filing, Mt. Gox said 750,000 customer bitcoins and another 100,000 belonging to the exchange were stolen due to a software security flaw. Karpeles has told others he has been hurt by accusations he masterminded the theft, and wants to return the bitcoins and cash to some 127,000 creditors. Karpeles, who has said he is reluctant to appear in public because of safety concerns, relieves stress by driving around Tokyo at night in a Honda Civic he bought as a company car at Mt. Gox, people close to him said. He lives alone with his cat, Tibane, whose exploits he used to chronicle on now-deleted Flickr and YouTube accounts. The cat\'s name, chosen by Karpeles\' late grandmother, inspired the name of his first company, Tibanne, which he set up in October 2009 in Japan. His employer at the time, software platform distributor Nexway, had transferred him to the country earlier that year. Born in Chenove, in the Burgundy region of France, Karpeles wrote his first computer program aged 10. He wrote on his blog that he "never really felt at home in France," and has not been back since moving to Japan five years ago. Shy and fearful of confrontation, the self-proclaimed "geek" felt comfortable in Japan, where he could also indulge his love of manga, video games and cosplay - a combination of "costume" and "play", where people dress as characters from Japanese anime, graphic manga novels and video games. Karpeles found solace in online communities, where he was known as "The Magical Tux", a reference to the penguin mascot of open-source operating system Linux. His escapism into virtual worlds was accompanied by what some former associates describe as a lack of interest in how running afoul of law and regulation could threaten his business and reputation. According to blog posts Karpeles wrote in 2006, he was arrested twice in France before he was 21 for computer fraud-related charges. One resulted in a 3-month suspended sentence. French authorities in Tokyo said they had seen confirmation of one prior conviction, but did not have details. In Japan, Karpeles was sued by a customer in 2012 who claimed he had paid 15,000 euros ($20,700) for a website to be developed that was never built. Tokyo District Court ruled last May that Karpeles had to return the money. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security seized $5.5 million in Mt. Gox bank accounts in 2013, saying the exchange had been late to register as a money transmitter. "A NICE EXPERIMENT" Karpeles became interested in bitcoin when a customer of his web-hosting services wanted to pay in the digital currency. Unlike other early fans of bitcoin, Karpeles had no particular interest in the libertarian philosophy that drove many bitcoin adopters. Instead, he told Reuters in a 2013 interview, he was interested in the technology as a "nice experiment". He met the founder of Mt. Gox, U.S. entrepreneur Jed McCaleb, on IRC, an online chat platform. McCaleb, nervous about regulatory scrutiny on bitcoin, wanted rid of the exchange and sold it to Karpeles in March 2011 for no upfront fee, people with knowledge of the deal said. Karpeles told others he had later paid McCaleb a small fee, calling it "a very good deal". McCaleb could not be reached for comment. Mt. Gox\'s user base mushroomed from 3,000 to 50,000 within three months as bitcoin gained traction. Unable to keep up with customer support queries, Karpeles hired his first five employees in June of that year, shortly after the company said in public announcements that it believed one or more hackers broke into the exchange\'s database and drove the price of bitcoin down to zero. Dazed by that security breach, a former employer said, Karpeles retreated to build a more secure trading platform but left the exchange offline, with thousands of emails from bewildered users unanswered until a group of bitcoin enthusiasts volunteered to come in to help. One was Roger Ver, who says he was stunned when Karpeles proposed they resume work on Monday rather than work through the weekend to solve the crisis. "He wasn\'t ever focused on Mt. Gox like he should have been," said Ver. As the exchange\'s business grew, Karpeles hired more staff to work in programming, customer support and user verification, eventually taking space in a central Tokyo office with 30 employees, with another dozen contractors overseas. ROBOTS, EXERCISE BALLS Karpeles wanted to be liked, three former employees say. He bought lunch for the entire staff and spent thousands of dollars on gadgets and equipment to make the office more "fun" - exercise balls for chairs, beer steins and robots. Late last year, in the middle of increasingly strained times for Mt. Gox, he spent an afternoon putting up a hammock in the recreation room. But staff found it galling that the boss was buying these goodies even while he refused to give pay raises. They also became frustrated as they waited for Karpeles to authorize decisions or make progress on simple tasks. Developers, stuck without direct access to the Mt. Gox source code, resorted to playing video games, people inside the company at the time say. Employees were also concerned that Karpeles\' tight grip on all company affairs was causing a bottleneck: he was the only person who could access the exchange\'s bank accounts and bitcoin holdings and resolve requests by traders to cash out. Former employees say they asked Karpeles to share the passwords to Mt. Gox\'s bitcoin wallets in case he became incapacitated or unable to access the data. He refused, leaving him as the only person able to piece together the passwords, written on paper stored at his home, the office, and an undisclosed location. Karpeles\' secrecy extended to the company accounts, which he refused to show to prospective investors who came to the company with proposals, according to former employees. Mandalah, a Tokyo consultancy that worked for Mt. Gox, was also frustrated by Karpeles\' lack of interest in outreach and business growth, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Mandalah declined to comment. As other competing exchanges developed more sophisticated trading systems, Karpeles diverted his attention from the exchange to buy an unrelated software company called Shade 3D and began to work on launching a \'Bitcoin Cafe\' - which would accept the digital currency as payment - on the ground floor of the office, according to records and former staff. Karpeles was planning to serve quiche and apple pies he\'d made himself in the cafe, which would also showcase a point-of-sales system he had spent hours tinkering with, a former employee said. The cafe never opened.

Satoshi Nakamoto, a name known to legions of bitcoin\ntraders, practitioners and boosters around the world, appeared\nto lose his anonymity on Thursday after Newsweek published a\nstory that said he lived in Temple City, California, just east\nof Los Angeles. Newsweek included a photograph and described a short\ninterview, in which Nakamoto said he was no longer associated\nwith Bitcoin and that it had been turned over to other people.\nThe magazine concluded that the man was the same Nakamoto who\nfounded Bitcoin. Dozens of reporters, including a sprinkling of Japanese\nmedia, encircled and camped outside the man\'s two-story house on\nThursday morning, accosting the mailman and repeatedly ringing\nthe doorbell, to no avail. Police cruisers drove by several\ntimes but did not stop. Several times, someone pulled back the drapes on an upstairs\nwindow. In the afternoon, the silver-haired, bespectacled Nakamoto\nstepped outside, dressed in a gray sport coat and green striped\nshirt, with a pen tucked in his shirt pocket. He was mobbed by\nreporters and told them he was looking for someone who\nunderstood Japanese to buy him a free lunch. Newsweek estimates his wealth at $400 million. "I\'m not involved in Bitcoin. Wait a minute, I want my free\nlunch first. I\'m going with this guy," Nakamoto said, pointing\nat a reporter from AP. "I\'m not in Bitcoin, I don\'t know\nanything about it," he said again while walking down the street\nwith several cameras at his heels. He and the AP reporter made their way to a nearby sushi\nrestaurant with media in tow, before leaving and heading\ndowntown. Los Angeles Times reporter Joe Bel Bruno followed the\npair and described the chase in a running stream of tweets.\nEventually, the pair dashed into the Associated Press offices in\ndowntown Los Angeles.  MISUNDERSTOOD In a later AP interview, Nakamoto said he was misunderstood\nin a key portion of the Newsweek story, where he tells the\nreporter on his doorstep, "I am no longer involved in that and I\ncannot discuss it." Asked by the AP if he had said that, Nakamoto said, "No." "I\'m saying I\'m no longer in engineering. That\'s it," he\ntold the AP. "And even if I was, when we get hired, you have to\nsign this document, contract saying you will not reveal anything\nwe divulge during and after employment. So that\'s what I\nimplied." "It sounded like I was involved before with Bitcoin and\nlooked like I\'m not involved now. That\'s not what I meant. I\nwant to clarify that," the AP reported him as saying. The Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group promoting the\nadoption of the digital currency, said "... We have seen zero\nconclusive evidence that the identified person is the designer\nof Bitcoin." "Those closest to the Bitcoin project, the informal team\nof core developers, have always been unaware of Nakamoto\'s true\nidentity, as Nakamoto communicated purely through electronic\nmeans," it said in a post on its website. Newsweek writer Leah McGrath Goodman told the AP that she\nstood by her story. "I stand completely by my exchange with Mr.\nNakamoto. There was no confusion whatsoever about the context of\nour conversation - and his acknowledgment of his involvement in\nBitcoin."  "FOCUSED AND ECLECTIC" Fans see Bitcoin as a digital-world currency beyond\ngovernment interference, while critics, whose ranks swelled with\nthe recent bankruptcy filing by major bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox,\n see a risky investment whose anonymity aids drug\ndealers and other criminals. Nakamoto kept a low profile in part to avoid the attention\nof authorities, Newsweek said. On Thursday, the office of\nBenjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\'s Department of\nFinancial Services, was keen on speaking with him, a source\nfamiliar with the situation told Reuters. Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network\nindependent of central control. Its value soared last year, and\nthe total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion. In the Newsweek article, Nakamoto was credited by Bitcoin\'s\nchief scientist, Gavin Andresen, in working out the first codes\nbehind the currency. A man of few words who refused to discuss anything beyond\nthe currency or even communicate outside of email, Nakamoto was\ndescribed by his brother in the Newsweek article as "fickle and\nhas very weird hobbies," including a penchant for model trains. Japanese-born Nakamoto displayed an unusual aptitude for\nmath as a child. He immigrated with his mother to California in\n1959. He worked for defense and electronics company Hughes\nAircraft, but never discussed work because much of it was\nclassified, according to Newsweek interviews with several\nfriends and relatives. "He\'s very focused and eclectic in his way of thinking.\nSmart, intelligent, mathematics, engineering, computers. You\nname it, he can do it," Newsweek quoted Arthur Nakamoto, his\nyounger brother, as saying.', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0M32KO20140307', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 6, 23, 27), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"UPDATE 2-Man called Bitcoin's father denies ties, leads LA car chase"}, {'articleText': u' * Investors drawn to transparency, lack of official control * Bitcoin\'s value spiked, crashed, took off again last year * Enthusiast wants widespread use before 2020 Tokyo Olympics By Kevin Krolicki and Nathan Layne TOKYO, Feb 28 Like other bitcoin evangelists,\nKen Shishido is ready to write off the money he lost in the\nbankruptcy of Tokyo-based virtual currency exchange Mt. Gox as\nthe price of revolutionising global finance. "In the early days of the automobile, there were traffic\naccidents because you didn\'t have traffic lights or pedestrian\ncrossings," he said hours after Mt. Gox said on Friday it had\nlost up to half a billion dollars of investor funds, including\nsome of his own. "But we didn\'t ban automobiles." Shishido, who lives in Tokyo, was one of about 10,000\ninvestors in Japan who became creditors in Mt. Gox\'s bankruptcy\nwhen the company capped a tumultuous period of weeks by filing\nfor bankruptcy on Friday. He lost about a tenth of his investment in bitcoin in Mt.\nGox, he said, and expected none of that money to come back. Early enthusiasts for the five-year-old crypto-currency were\ndrawn to its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of\ncentral or official control. There was also a heady mix of geek\nchic - the currency is "mined" through a process involving\ncomplex computer math - and laissez-faire Austrian economics. Mt. Gox\'s loss is eye-popping but so too is the number of\ncreditors - 127,000 - in what had been the world\'s biggest\nexchange. That means the average trader lost the equivalent of\n$3,500 in the bankruptcy at current bitcoin prices, assuming no\nmoney is recovered in the court-supervised restructuring in\nTokyo set to play out over the following months.  VALUE SPIKES, CRASHES, TAKES OFF AGAIN Bitcoin\'s value spiked in April 2013 as the crisis-racked\nCyprus government clamped down on withdrawals and seized\ndeposits, rattling faith in "fiat" currencies. The crypto-currency soon crashed back. Late last year, as\nthe number of exchanges and the virtual money\'s name recognition\ngrew, it took off again. Bitcoin gained wider acceptance - and took off again in\nprice - late last year. It attracted high-profile proponents,\nlike the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook\nfame, and speculators. Investors interviewed after the exchange collapsed faulted\nthe Tokyo exchange and Mt. Gox\'s French CEO Mark Karpeles, but\nthey remained committed to the bitcoin idea. Roger Ver, a big investor in Mt. Gox, said he did not know\nif he would ever get any of his lost bitcoin back. "But the important thing to realize is that Mt. Gox is just\none company using bitcoin. The bitcoin technology itself is\nstill absolutely amazing," he said. "Even if one email service provider is having a problem that\ndoesn\'t mean people are going to stop using email. It\'s the same\nwith bitcoin."  POSITIVE VIEW Ver spoke of "all of the positive ways in which bitcoin is\ngoing to change the world ... if anything, it is kind of for the\nbetter of bitcoin that the irresponsible players are going out\nof business." Shishido said he does not expect to get his virtual money\nback, but that the rest of his bitcoin investments had soared\n10-fold in value. Keiichi Hida, a bitcoin investor and member of the Japan\nDigital Money Association, lost 100,000 yen ($980) worth of\nbitcoins, which he got involved with as a form of "study". But\nhe was unfazed. "We should make it a national project to have bitcoin used\nnationwide at the time of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics," he said. "I\nthink then everyone would come to Tokyo in an instant." Mt. Gox CEO Karpeles, even after bowing to apologise for the\nexchange\'s bankruptcy, later said the currency will endure.

Gox agitated for proof that\nthe Tokyo-based firm was still solvent after a hacking attack,\nCEO Mark Karpeles turned to the comedy science fiction novel\n"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy". During an online chat, Karpeles moved the equivalent of $170\nmillion in bitcoin at today\'s market rates - the virtual\nequivalent of a bank manager flashing a wad of cash in a wallet\nto establish credit. The gesture - with a sly wink to the "geek"\nculture Karpeles believed he shared with many of his 50,000\ncustomers at the time, including an interest in coding, Japanese\nmanga comics and science fiction - succeeded.

"Don\'t come after me claiming we have no\ncoins," Karpeles said, according to a transcript of that online\ndiscussion. "42 is the answer." As the price of bitcoin soared from a few dollars to above\n$1,000, Mt.

Gox boomed, French-born Karpeles seemed both\nkeen to maintain total control of key operations and indifferent\nto commercial success, according to former staff and associates\nwho spoke to Reuters, but asked not to be named because of\nongoing investigations into the exchange\'s collapse. Creditors who want to know how Mt. Gox at one point lost\nsome $500 million worth of bitcoin and another $27 million in\ncash from its bank accounts, are seeking answers from Karpeles,\nwho has spent recent days huddled in meetings with lawyers in\nTokyo. Mt. Gox and its lawyers declined repeated requests for\ncomment for this article. Lawyers for Karpeles told a U.S. judge last week that he was\n"not willing" to travel to the United States - as ordered by the\njudge to answer questions in a bankruptcy court - until his\nattorneys can "get up to speed" on a new subpoena from the U.S.\nTreasury Department. Karpeles doesn\'t want to go\nto the U.S. as he fears he could be arrested by authorities\nthere, a person familiar with his thinking said. "Regardless of whether it was a massive fraud or whether he\nwas just grossly negligent, at the end of the day he\'s at\nfault," said Steven Woodrow, a lawyer representing a U.S. class\naction against Karpeles brought by Mt. Gox creditors. Mt. Gox\'s bid to resuscitate its business was dismissed by a\nTokyo court on Wednesday, and the court-appointed administrator\nsaid that meant the firm was likely to be liquidated. He added\nthat Karpeles was likely to be investigated for liability in the\nexchange\'s collapse.    THE MAGICAL TUX In its bankruptcy filing, Mt. Gox said 750,000 customer\nbitcoins and another 100,000 belonging to the exchange were\nstolen due to a software security flaw. Karpeles has told others\nhe has been hurt by accusations he masterminded the theft, and\nwants to return the bitcoins and cash to some 127,000 creditors. Karpeles, who has said he is reluctant to appear in public\nbecause of safety concerns, relieves stress by driving around\nTokyo at night in a Honda Civic he bought as a company car at\nMt. Gox, people close to him said. He lives alone with his cat,\nTibane, whose exploits he used to chronicle on now-deleted\nFlickr and YouTube accounts. The cat\'s name, chosen by Karpeles\' late grandmother,\ninspired the name of his first company, Tibanne, which he set up\nin October 2009 in Japan. His employer at the time, software\nplatform distributor Nexway, had transferred him to the country\nearlier that year. Born in Chenove, in the Burgundy region of France, Karpeles\nwrote his first computer program aged 10. He wrote on his blog\nthat he "never really felt at home in France," and has not been\nback since moving to Japan five years ago. Shy and fearful of confrontation, the self-proclaimed "geek"\nfelt comfortable in Japan, where he could also indulge his love\nof manga, video games and cosplay - a combination of "costume"\nand "play", where people dress as characters from Japanese\nanime, graphic manga novels and video games. Karpeles found\nsolace in online communities, where he was known as "The Magical\nTux", a reference to the penguin mascot of open-source operating\nsystem Linux. His escapism into virtual worlds was accompanied by what\nsome former associates describe as a lack of interest in how\nrunning afoul of law and regulation could threaten his business\nand reputation. According to blog posts Karpeles wrote in 2006, he was\narrested twice in France before he was 21 for computer\nfraud-related charges. One resulted in a 3-month suspended\nsentence. French authorities in Tokyo said they had seen\nconfirmation of one prior conviction, but did not have details. In Japan, Karpeles was sued by a customer in 2012 who\nclaimed he had paid 15,000 euros ($20,700) for a website to be\ndeveloped that was never built. Tokyo District Court ruled last\nMay that Karpeles had to return the money. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security seized $5.5 million\nin Mt. Gox bank accounts in 2013, saying the exchange had been\nlate to register as a money transmitter.  "A NICE EXPERIMENT" Karpeles became interested in bitcoin when a customer of his\nweb-hosting services wanted to pay in the digital currency.\nUnlike other early fans of bitcoin, Karpeles had no particular\ninterest in the libertarian philosophy that drove many bitcoin\nadopters. Instead, he told Reuters in a 2013 interview, he was\ninterested in the technology as a "nice experiment". He met the founder of Mt. Gox, U.S. entrepreneur Jed\nMcCaleb, on IRC, an online chat platform. McCaleb, nervous about\nregulatory scrutiny on bitcoin, wanted rid of the exchange and\nsold it to Karpeles in March 2011 for no upfront fee, people\nwith knowledge of the deal said. Karpeles told others he had\nlater paid McCaleb a small fee, calling it "a very good deal".\nMcCaleb could not be reached for comment. Mt. Gox\'s user base mushroomed from 3,000 to 50,000 within\nthree months as bitcoin gained traction. Unable to keep up with\ncustomer support queries, Karpeles hired his first five\nemployees in June of that year, shortly after the company said\nin public announcements that it believed one or more hackers\nbroke into the exchange\'s database and drove the price of\nbitcoin down to zero. Dazed by that security breach, a former employer said,\nKarpeles retreated to build a more secure trading platform but\nleft the exchange offline, with thousands of emails from\nbewildered users unanswered until a group of bitcoin enthusiasts\nvolunteered to come in to help. One was Roger Ver, who says he\nwas stunned when Karpeles proposed they resume work on Monday\nrather than work through the weekend to solve the crisis. "He wasn\'t ever focused on Mt. Gox like he should have\nbeen," said Ver. As the exchange\'s business grew, Karpeles hired more staff\nto work in programming, customer support and user verification,\neventually taking space in a central Tokyo office with 30\nemployees, with another dozen contractors overseas.  ROBOTS, EXERCISE BALLS Karpeles wanted to be liked, three former employees say. He\nbought lunch for the entire staff and spent thousands of dollars\non gadgets and equipment to make the office more "fun" -\nexercise balls for chairs, beer steins and robots. Late last\nyear, in the middle of increasingly strained times for Mt. Gox,\nhe spent an afternoon putting up a hammock in the recreation\nroom. But staff found it galling that the boss was buying these\ngoodies even while he refused to give pay raises. They also\nbecame frustrated as they waited for Karpeles to authorise\ndecisions or make progress on simple tasks. Developers, stuck\nwithout direct access to the Mt. Gox source code, resorted to\nplaying video games, people inside the company at the time say. Employees were also concerned that Karpeles\' tight grip on\nall company affairs was causing a bottleneck: he was the only\nperson who could access the exchange\'s bank accounts and bitcoin\nholdings and resolve requests by traders to cash out. Former employees say they asked Karpeles to share the\npasswords to Mt. Gox\'s bitcoin wallets in case he became\nincapacitated or unable to access the data. He refused, leaving\nhim as the only person able to piece together the passwords,\nwritten on paper stored at his home, the office, and an\nundisclosed location. Karpeles\' secrecy extended to the company accounts, which he\nrefused to show to prospective investors who came to the company\nwith proposals, according to former employees. Mandalah, a Tokyo\nconsultancy that worked for Mt. Gox, was also frustrated by\nKarpeles\' lack of interest in outreach and business growth,\naccording to people with knowledge of the matter. Mandalah\ndeclined to comment. As other competing exchanges developed more sophisticated\ntrading systems, Karpeles diverted his attention from the\nexchange to buy an unrelated software company called Shade 3D\nand began to work on launching a \'Bitcoin Cafe\' - which would\naccept the digital currency as payment - on the ground floor of\nthe office, according to records and former staff. Karpeles was planning to serve quiche and apple pies he\'d\nmade himself in the cafe, which would also showcase a\npoint-of-sales system he had spent hours tinkering with, a\nformer employee said. The cafe never opened.

Gox bitcoin hub, 'geek' CEO sought both control and escape"}, {'articleText': u' SINGAPORE A young American CEO who apparently committed suicide in Singapore was involved in the world of the bitcoin, but was also struggling with other issues prior to her death, friends and colleagues said. Autumn Radtke, chief executive of virtual currency exchange First Meta Pte Ltd, was found dead on February 26. Police said they were investigating her "unnatural" death, and "preliminary investigations showed no foul play is suspected." Neighbors said they thought Radtke jumped to her death from a residential apartment complex near her home. Friends and colleagues said Radtke, 28, was wrestling with professional and personal pressures, not least running a start-up that was struggling to gain traction. "She had a phenomenal network of highly successful people around her, and here she is running this little exchange and it just isn\'t taking off in the way anybody had hoped," Steve Beauregard, CEO and founder of GoCoin, a start-up which provided bitcoin-related services to First Meta, told Reuters. Beauregard rented a room in Radtke\'s large Singapore home-cum-office and was among the last people to see her alive. Bitcoin is under scrutiny after Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\'s dominant exchange for the virtual currency, filed for bankruptcy in Japan last week, blaming hackers for the loss of 850,000 bitcoins - worth more than $550 million at today\'s rates. A smaller, Canada-based exchange also shut, saying hackers had stolen all its bitcoins. Douglas Abrams, director of First Meta, denied the company was struggling or up for sale, and said Radtke "did a great job as CEO." But he said selling the company always remained an option and there had been plans to save money by moving out of its current office space, a townhouse which doubled as Radtke\'s home. Beauregard and others said First Meta, which initially functioned as an online trade platform for the currency used in the Second Life online world, and then expanded to other games, was not primarily involved in bitcoin. Last year, it allowed users to sell bitcoins for dollars and last month signed a deal with GoCoin. "I\'m not trying to distance First Meta from bitcoin, but it doesn\'t provide two-way trading in bitcoin," Abrams told Reuters. BITCOIN FAN Friends said Radtke, however, was a huge fan of bitcoin and had invested in it personally. One said she had persuaded friends to invest as well. Her Facebook page includes several links to bitcoin stories, mostly celebrating last year\'s rise in value. In one, she comments on a sharp but brief dip in the bitcoin price last December: "The \'panic\' or as I call it Christmas sale was great! Real bitcoiners got 30-40 percent off." "She had substantial exposure to the ups and downs of bitcoin, and while it\'s not likely to be the sole reason to this tragedy, it would be naive to think it didn\'t have a role," said one friend. Others contested any role the virtual currency had in her death. Beauregard said he had several conversations with her in the 48 hours prior to her death about personal and professional issues. "Bitcoin and Mt. Gox were not part of those conversations," he said. Radtke, who moved to Singapore in early 2012, previously worked at another start-up in Santa Monica, California. Plug and Play\'s Scott Robinson, who focuses on Silicon Valley bitcoin start-ups, said Radtke\'s years of experience in video game virtual currencies made her an instant expert and an asset to the relatively young, predominantly male, bitcoin community. "She was a go-getter, she always worked very hard ... she stuck out as one of the only women representing bitcoin." Before heading up First Meta, Radtke had business development roles at tech start-ups Xfire and Geodelic Systems, according to information on her LinkedIn profile.

Gox agitated for proof that\nthe Tokyo-based firm was still solvent after a hacking attack,\nCEO Mark Karpeles turned to the comedy science fiction novel\n"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy". During an online chat, Karpeles moved the equivalent of $170\nmillion in bitcoin at today\'s market rates - the virtual\nequivalent of a bank manager flashing a wad of cash in a wallet\nto establish credit. The gesture - with a sly wink to the "geek"\nculture Karpeles believed he shared with many of his 50,000\ncustomers at the time, including an interest in coding, Japanese\nmanga comics and science fiction - succeeded. By moving 424,242 bitcoins, Karpeles, then 26, evoked the\nrandom number, 42, described as the "meaning of life" in Douglas\nAdams\' sci-fi novel. "Don\'t come after me claiming we have no\ncoins," Karpeles said, according to a transcript of that online\ndiscussion. "42 is the answer." As the price of bitcoin soared from a few dollars to above\n$1,000, Mt. Gox grew to become the world\'s largest exchange for\nthe digital currency, handling flows worth $3 billion in 2013,\nby the company\'s own reckoning. But even as Mt. Gox boomed, French-born Karpeles seemed both\nkeen to maintain total control of key operations and indifferent\nto commercial success, according to former staff and associates\nwho spoke to Reuters, but asked not to be named because of\nongoing investigations into the exchange\'s collapse.

Satoshi Nakamoto, a name known to legions of bitcoin traders, practitioners and boosters around the world, appeared to lose his anonymity on Thursday after Newsweek published a story that said he lived in Temple City, California, just east of Los Angeles. Newsweek included a photograph and described a short interview, in which Nakamoto said he was no longer associated with Bitcoin and that it had been turned over to other people. The magazine concluded that the man was the same Nakamoto who founded Bitcoin. Dozens of reporters, including a sprinkling of Japanese media, encircled and camped outside the man\'s two-story house on Thursday morning, accosting the mailman and repeatedly ringing the doorbell, to no avail. Police cruisers drove by several times but did not stop. Several times, someone pulled back the drapes on an upstairs window. In the afternoon, the silver-haired, bespectacled Nakamoto stepped outside, dressed in a gray sport coat and green striped shirt, with a pen tucked in his shirt pocket. He was mobbed by reporters and told them he was looking for someone who understood Japanese to buy him a free lunch. Newsweek estimates his wealth at $400 million. "I\'m not involved in Bitcoin. Wait a minute, I want my free lunch first. I\'m going with this guy," Nakamoto said, pointing at a reporter from AP. "I\'m not in Bitcoin, I don\'t know anything about it," he said again while walking down the street with several cameras at his heels. He and the AP reporter made their way to a nearby sushi restaurant with media in tow, before leaving and heading downtown. Los Angeles Times reporter Joe Bel Bruno followed the pair and described the chase in a running stream of tweets. Eventually, the pair dashed into the Associated Press offices in downtown Los Angeles. MISUNDERSTOOD In a later AP interview, Nakamoto said he was misunderstood in a key portion of the Newsweek story, where he tells the reporter on his doorstep, "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it." Asked by the AP if he had said that, Nakamoto said, "No." "I\'m saying I\'m no longer in engineering. That\'s it," he told the AP. "And even if I was, when we get hired, you have to sign this document, contract saying you will not reveal anything we divulge during and after employment. So that\'s what I implied." "It sounded like I was involved before with Bitcoin and looked like I\'m not involved now. That\'s not what I meant. I want to clarify that," the AP reported him as saying. The Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group promoting the adoption of the digital currency, said "... We have seen zero conclusive evidence that the identified person is the designer of Bitcoin." "Those closest to the Bitcoin project, the informal team of core developers, have always been unaware of Nakamoto\'s true identity, as Nakamoto communicated purely through electronic means," it said in a post on its website. Newsweek writer Leah McGrath Goodman told the AP that she stood by her story. "I stand completely by my exchange with Mr. Nakamoto. There was no confusion whatsoever about the context of our conversation - and his acknowledgment of his involvement in Bitcoin." "FOCUSED AND ECLECTIC" Fans see Bitcoin as a digital-world currency beyond government interference, while critics, whose ranks swelled with the recent bankruptcy filing by major bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, see a risky investment whose anonymity aids drug dealers and other criminals. Nakamoto kept a low profile in part to avoid the attention of authorities, Newsweek said. On Thursday, the office of Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\'s Department of Financial Services, was keen on speaking with him, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value soared last year, and the total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion. In the Newsweek article, Nakamoto was credited by Bitcoin\'s chief scientist, Gavin Andresen, in working out the first codes behind the currency. A man of few words who refused to discuss anything beyond the currency or even communicate outside of email, Nakamoto was described by his brother in the Newsweek article as "fickle and has very weird hobbies," including a penchant for model trains. Japanese-born Nakamoto displayed an unusual aptitude for math as a child. He immigrated with his mother to California in 1959. He worked for defense and electronics company Hughes Aircraft, but never discussed work because much of it was classified, according to Newsweek interviews with several friends and relatives. "He\'s very focused and eclectic in his way of thinking. Smart, intelligent, mathematics, engineering, computers. You name it, he can do it," Newsweek quoted Arthur Nakamoto, his younger brother, as saying.

Gox said a halt on withdrawals it announced on Friday would continue indefinitely after it detected "unusual activity." The bitcoin price varied dramatically from one exchange to another, with Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the best known operator of a bitcoin digital marketplace, recording one of the biggest drops for the day. On the Mt. Gox platform the currency plunged to as low as $500 early on Monday, down more than 27 percent from Friday\'s final price of $692, according to the Mt. Gox website. It last traded at $595.74, off nearly 14 percent from Friday. "This technical issue is of a much larger intensity than we\'ve seen in the past," said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York. "The market may be realizing that there are issues which are specific to these forms of currencies." The bitcoin in recent months started to gain wider acceptance, with Overstock.com and the Sacramento Kings basketball team both saying they would begin to accept the currency. More recently, the digital currency has drawn increased scrutiny. New York state\'s top bank regulator in late January revealed plans to regulate businesses handling transactions in bitcoin this year. TRANSACTIONS COULD BE ALTERED The bitcoin price started falling fast on Friday when Mt. Gox said it was temporarily halting withdrawals due to unexplained technical issues. In an updated statement on Monday, Mt. Gox said withdrawals were on hold indefinitely after it "has detected unusual activity on its bitcoin wallets and performed investigations during the past weeks. This confirmed the presence of transactions which need to be examined more closely." Mt. Gox said a "bug in the bitcoin software" could allow transaction details to be altered. In effect, someone on the network could alter transaction details to make it appear a transfer of bitcoins from one digital wallet to another had not occurred when in fact it had. This might cause the transfer to be repeated. A bitcoin wallet is an application that stores bitcoins for the currency\'s users. Mt. Gox said the issue was not limited to the exchange and "affects all transactions where bitcoins are being sent to a third party." It said the withdrawal suspension would be in effect until the issue has been resolved. CoinDesk, which launched the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index in September, removed Mt. Gox from its index Monday, citing its "persistent failure to meet the index\'s standards for inclusion." "These recent withdrawal restrictions are just the latest in a series of issues which have made Mt. Gox\'s inclusion in the BPI problematic," CoinDesk said. On CoinDesk\'s bitcoin index, the bitcoin price was lower but not by nearly as much as on the Mt. Gox platform. The CoinDesk index showed bitcoin at $667.79 on late Monday afternoon, down about 5 percent from Friday\'s close of $703.57. Its low for the day was around $540 versus $500 on Mt. Gox. On both platforms, the price was still around the lowest since late December. The price had topped $1,000 as recently as late January. "With the volatility in the currency being as much as it is, it\'s going to take some time before we get enough of a comfort level from investors and merchants to enable it to be used ubiquitously," said Darrin Peller, managing director at Barclays in New York. The arrest of a prominent bitcoin advocate just over two weeks ago threw a spotlight on the currency. Charlie Shrem, 24, operator of the Bitinstant bitcoin exchange company, was charged by U.S. prosecutors with conspiring to commit money laundering by helping to funnel cash to illicit online drugs bazaar Silk Road. The following day Shrem resigned as vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group.

Charlie Shrem\'s detention on money laundering charges the day before shocked New York\'s Bitcoin community, which meets in a small conference room to trade the currency. It is contemplating the end of a world of intrigue away from the watchful eyes of police and regulators. "Charlie\'s a good kid, and he serves good drinks," said Jacob Dienelt, who trades Bitcoins himself. Shrem, 24, partly owns a bar in Manhattan that accepts Bitcoins as payment. Dienelt was acting as an unofficial spokesman for a community that has come under intense scrutiny as authorities crack down on illegal activity carried out using the currency. Dienelt said he wanted the world to know Shrem, who was charged on Monday with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating a money changing business without a license, was not a bad person. Shrem, who resigned as vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation after his arrest, is presumed innocent, his lawyer Keith Miller said on Monday. One thing is clear, though, after a week that included not only Shrem\'s arrest but also two days of testimony about Bitcoin regulation to a panel of financial regulators in New York: Bitcoin users are finding that their freewheeling ways are no longer acceptable. Tighter controls will undermine the anonymity that had been a major attraction of the digital currency. The pressure is on promoters of Bitcoins, which are not backed by a government or central bank and whose value fluctuates according to demand, to either comply with the demands of the police and regulators or face prosecution. The authorities are not only swooping down when they suspect criminal activity but regulators also want to set rules for Bitcoin entrepreneurs in the same way they police banks and others in the traditional financial system. In particular, they are demanding reporting of any suspicious transactions. New York\'s top financial regulator on Tuesday even raised the idea of creating a "BitLicense" - rather like a banking license - for those who provide marketplaces where Bitcoins can be exchanged for dollars and other currencies. SILK ROAD The old Bitcoin world spawned people such as 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht, who was charged in October with counts relating to drug trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking. Prosecutors accused Ulbricht of involvement in the anonymous Internet marketplace Silk Road, which they said sold drugs and criminal services in exchange for Bitcoins. Ulbricht has maintained his innocence through statements by his lawyer. It was the world in which Shrem, a computer whiz from Brooklyn\'s Syrian Jewish community, rocketed to prominence as a wealthy businessman, with a bitcoin trading platform and the bar to his name. Now, Bitcoin exchanges will likely have to team up with traditional banks or at least imitate some of their anti-money laundering practices, keeping meticulous records of customer identities and report any suspicious activity to regulators. Law enforcement officials have already shown they can attach real names to the Bitcoin addresses of suspected criminals, which means the digital currency is no longer a cloak for some to hide behind. The loss of much of the anonymity of Bitcoin trading may diminish its appeal before it has the chance to get traction with larger numbers of potential users, some experts say. "With a fluctuating price driven by speculators and an uncertain legal regime, Bitcoin\'s viability as a consumer currency is still up in the air," said Matthew Rhoades, director of the cyberspace & security program at the Truman Project and Center for National Policy. Certainly, the strongest Bitcoin supporters say there are still plenty of attractions despite the changes, including the speed of transactions and lack of centralized control. They are banking on mass adoption of the currency to smooth out awkwardness created by its wild price fluctuations and unwieldy technology. They say if the majority of businesses can be convinced to accept Bitcoins there will be less need to exchange them for mainstream currencies, and less interaction with the authorities. "I think regulation will actually normalize the whole thing," said James Barcia, the communications director for the NYC Bitcoin Center, which hosts the weekly trading sessions. Some of the most successful Bitcoin entrepreneurs say there is no choice but to work with governments and traditional banks if Bitcoin is to grow. Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of the Bitcoin trading platform Coinbase, said his company took a position early on that it would not fight regulators. Regulators have cited it as an example of how others should behave. "The whole reason we have such confidence in our company is that from the start we said this has got to be something that plays nicely with the traditional financial world," Ehrsam said in an interview. Coinbase quickly hired Silicon Valley\'s top compliance experts, luring away the online payment system PayPal\'s chief compliance officer and also hiring lawyers with extensive Silicon Valley experience. One of their main points of focus is the "know your customer" rule, which puts the onus on financial services providers to make sure they are not doing business with criminals. To follow it, Bitcoin businesses are going to have to collect some information about who their customers are and how they are using their funds. "We\'ve seen a change in the types of people who are attracted to Bitcoin over the last few years," said Jeremy Liew, a venture capitalist who invests in businesses dealing in the digital currency, in testimony to officials from New York\'s Financial Services Department. Liew said criminals and people with strong political opposition to governments were among the currency\'s earliest adopters but were not the people he saw as being good for the Bitcoin business. "The Bitcoin community is moving in the direction of greater legitimacy," he said.

Mt Gox was once the world's leading exchange for trading the digital currency, but shut its website earlier this year after saying it lost some 850,000 bitcoins - worth more than $500 million at current prices - in a hacking attack.

The company filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in March to prevent U.S. customers who had filed a class action lawsuit from seizing its U.S. assets, such as computer servers, and demanding evidence and access to Mt Gox executives. Since then, the company and the class action plaintiffs reached a settlement, which is awaiting final approval by a federal court in Chicago.

Rising interest from mainland Chinese speculators was credited for driving up global bitcoin prices last year to above $1,000 on some exchanges. But a subsequent crackdown by the People\'s Bank of China (PBOC) has seen the digital currency sag, changing hands below $530 on Wednesday, according to exchange-tracker CoinDesk. That, in combination with scandals involving hacking, theft, and fraud, have put pressure on digital currency markets around the world. Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has given up plans to rebuild under bankruptcy protection and asked a local court to allow it to be liquidated, The Wall Street Journal reported. Unlike conventional money, bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are generated by computers and are not backed by any central bank or government, or by physical assets. They can be exchanged through nearly any file transfer mechanism for goods, services or cash - but the latter has proved a problem. Many regulatory agencies around the world are concerned that digital currencies can be easily used for money laundering or the illegal purchase of weapons and narcotics, and have moved to control or prohibit their use in ordinary commerce. In December, the PBOC banned financial institutions from trading in bitcoin, saying the government would act to prevent money laundering risks from the digital currency. It did not ban trading by individuals. Last week, two bitcoin exchanges said their trading accounts at certain domestic banks would be closed down by the lenders. BTC China\'s chief executive Bobby Lee said by telephone that his exchange is still in operation and has yet to receive any notice from the bank that his accounts are being closed. "News reports said it would be shut down by April 15. It\'s April 16 and nothing has happened," he said. While trading volumes on his exchange are down 80-90 percent from their peak, transaction levels were still healthy, said Lee, on par with levels last September prior to bitcoin\'s spike.

The machine was lightly used during a visit by Reuters, with just one client appearing to use it, but cafe manager Cheng Mengyao said she had seen a steady stream of customers use the machine for small transactions since it was installed. The web app essentially allows transactions on a direct peer-to-peer basis, as opposed to selling them on an open exchange.

Gox, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, abruptly stopped trading on Tuesday, shaking investor confidence in the digital currency that is struggling for legitimacy. WHAT IS BITCOIN? A form of electronic money independent of traditional banking, bitcoins started circulating in 2009 and have become the most prominent of several fledgling digital currencies. The virtual currency relies on a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction that is made. Unlike traditional currencies, where a central bank decides how much money to print based on goals like controlling inflation, no central authority governs the supply of bitcoins. Like other commodities and currencies, its value depends on people\'s confidence in it. HOW VOLATILE IS IT? The dollar price of bitcoins quoted on online exchange Bitstamp spiked from around $30 a year ago to more than $1,100 in December as more people became aware of the currency and speculators jumped into the highly volatile market. But growing attention from regulators and concerns that bitcoins could be more susceptible to fraud than previously thought have sparked a steady decline in prices, to around $530 on Tuesday. Compounding the issue, its price can vary greatly depending on the exchange. WHERE CAN I USE MY BITCOINS? Proponents say bitcoins could one day become widely used by consumers for online shopping and other electronic transactions. Certain online retailers such as Overstock.com and physical stores, mostly smaller operations, already accept the digital currency, but its adoption is not widespread. Critics say bitcoin is too volatile to be widely adopted and warn of its lack of regulation and its use to pay for illegal drugs and other nefarious transactions. HOW DO YOU STORE, TRADE AND SPEND BITCOINS? Bitcoins are held in virtual wallets with unique keys. Transactions are made by sending bitcoins from one wallet to a unique key associated with another wallet in a cryptographic process that is verified by computers across the bitcoin network. Bitcoin wallets can be stored offline or online at exchanges like Bitstamp and BTC-E. HOW ARE BITCOINS CREATED? The system was designed to reward computers that do the crucial work of verifying transactions with the occasional payoff of new bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin mining. The growth in the virtual currency\'s value has created a market for souped-up computers and chips especially designed for the cryptographic calculations used in bitcoin. About 12.4 million bitcoins, worth $6.2 billion at recent prices, have been minted since the currency began circulating, according to Blockchain.info. WHAT HAPPENED TO MT. GOX? The Tokyo-based bourse halted withdrawals earlier this month after detecting "unusual activity", and on Tuesday it abruptly stopped trading. An unverified document circulating on the Internet purporting to be a crisis plan for Mt. Gox said more than 744,000 bitcoins were "missing due to malleability-related theft." Mt. Gox began as a website for exchanging trading cards before turning to bitcoin. WHAT\'S THE FUTURE OF BITCOIN? Bitcoin critics say Mt. Gox\'s apparent failure proves the unregulated currency is far from ready for widespread use. They also point to hacking attacks at other exchanges. But proponents say it\'s early days for virtual currencies and note that newer bitcoin exchanges and other startups aiming to make bitcoin mainstream are supervised by seasoned venture capitalists and financial experts. Many bitcoin advocates still hold out the hope of creating a digital currency system free of government intervention or control.

Gox bankruptcy process By William Mallard TOKYO, March 7 A week after the collapse of Mt.\nGox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the\nbitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal\ntender, though it might be taxable and subject to\nmoney-laundering controls. In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the\nTokyo-based company, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange,\nthe government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is\ncovered - or more often, not covered - by existing law. The issue took on new prominence in Japan on Feb. 28, when\nMt. Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it\nhad lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due\nto hacker attacks.    Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some\ncircumstances, the statement says. Although the government\nunderstands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any\ngovernment or central bank, "we have not grasped the situation\nin its entirety." The authorities are monitoring the Mt. Gox bankruptcy\nprocess and, if necessary, will consider a response, said Chief\nCabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. Fewer than 1 percent of Mt. Gox\'s 127,000 creditors are\nJapanese, the company has said. Yet across the government,\nofficials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin. "It\'s not money," said Finance Minister Taro Aso. "Does the\nFinancial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance\nMinistry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy,\nTrade and Industry?" he asked at a regular news conference.\n"Opinions are divided." The government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and\nregulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within\nthe purview of professional trading or asset management, while\ntrading the virtual currency is not a banking or\nfinancial-instrument transaction. But, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it\nmeets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax\nlaws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that\nbitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the\nstatement does not specify this. Regarding money laundering, certain transactions - whether\nwith bitcoin or not - require people to identify themselves, it\nnotes. The 6-page document is the government\'s official response to\nquestions posed by Tsutomu Okubo, a member of the opposition\nDemocratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan\nStanley.

Gox collapse, Japan struggles to understand bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u' TOKYO Any regulation of the bitcoin crypto-currency should involve international cooperation to avoid loopholes, Japanese vice finance minister Jiro Aichi said on Thursday. Commenting on the closure this week of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\'s biggest exchange for the bitcoin virtual currency, Aichi said the ministry would respond to the problems "if necessary", after finding out exactly what happened. "It\'s not just the Ministry of Finance; many other agencies are related," Aichi told a news conference. "As for its legal position, a currency (under Japan\'s jurisdiction) would be coins or notes issued by the Bank of Japan. At the very least, we can say bitcoin is not a currency." U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, appearing on Thursday before a Senate committee, said the Fed has no jurisdiction over bitcoin but that Congress should consider ways to regulate such virtual currencies. The Mt. Gox website and Twitter feed went blank on Tuesday after weeks of turmoil. It suspended withdrawals on February 7 following a series of cyber attacks, leaving customers unable to recover their funds. A document circulating on the internet saying that more than 744,000 bitcoins - worth around $423 million at current rates - were missing from Mt. Gox was created by a Tokyo-based consulting firm, said Ryan Selkis, a blogger who initially leaked scans of the document. Selkis, who uses the handle "twobitidiot", said in an email that the "Crisis Strategy Draft" had been written by consulting firm Mandalah in meetings with Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles. A director at Mandalah told Reuters the firm had never been contracted by Mt. Gox to do "strategic planning" but declined to comment further. On Wednesday, Karpeles had sought to assure investors that he was working with others to solve the problems. "As there is a lot of speculation regarding Mt. Gox and its future, I would like to use this opportunity to reassure everyone that I am still in Japan, and working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues," he said in a statement posted on the Mt. Gox website. MT. GOX REBRANDING? While proponents of bitcoin hail its anonymity and lack of ties to traditional banking, regulators have become increasingly interested in the digital currency due to its volatility and usage by criminal elements. Bitcoins are created, or "mined", in a process using a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction that is made. At current prices, the bitcoin market is worth about $7 billion. The document leaked this week by Selkis - who says he sold all his bitcoins - said 744,408 bitcoins, or about 6 percent of the 12.4 million bitcoins in circulation, were "missing" due to thefts that exploited "malleability" in the code governing transactions, which the Bitcoin Foundation and others have blamed on Mt. Gox\'s customized software. "Mt. Gox has been broken and it was obvious there was something really bad going on there for nearly a year. They were processing withdrawals very slowly and generally being very opaque about what was going," said Mike Hearn, a bitcoin developer in Switzerland. The leaked crisis plan proposed that Mt. Gox reduce its liabilities, switch off the exchange for a month while bringing in transition advisers, and reset all social network channels while rebranding under a different CEO. Karpeles told Reuters in April 2013 that Mt. Gox was seeing daily inflows of $5-$20 million. He told Forbes his company hadn\'t been able to keep up with all the changes as it became the largest exchange in the world. The crisis plan said Mt. Gox had liabilities of $174 million, based on an assumed exchange rate of $160 per bitcoin - well below the $550 or so offered for bitcoins at other exchanges on Thursday - against assets of $32 million. A financial statement included in that document said Mt. Gox was expected to make $2 million in net income in the year to end-March, a sevenfold increase on the previous year. It also said Mt. Gox turned a profit in its second year of existence, banking $286,000 in net income. Those figures match a 2013 report by credit research firm Tokyo Shoko Research, which was reviewed by Reuters. It said Mt. Gox "had a strong start". Mt. Gox had 600,000 customers at the time, the research report said - 30 percent from the United States, 10 percent from Britain and just 300 in Japan. Given that most users are overseas, any court case to retrieve missing funds would be more likely in the United States than Japan, said Ken Kiyohara, a lawyer at Jones Day. "It probably comes under the (Japanese) Financial Services Agency\'s (FSA) remit, but giving a reason for that in one sentence is impossible," he said. Officials at the FSA and Finance Ministry each told Reuters bitcoin does not fall within their purview, while the Bank of Japan says only that it is studying the bitcoin phenomenon, which Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has called "interesting." People who had bitcoins at Mt. Gox are more definitive. "It was the only place you could buy bitcoin directly with yen, so it hurts that it\'s gone," said Ryoichi Taga, a fellow at the Japan Digital Money Association. NOBODY HOME Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has sent subpoenas to Mt. Gox, other bitcoin exchanges and businesses that deal in bitcoins to seek information on how they handled recent cyber attacks, a source familiar with the probe said. A spokesman for Bharara declined to comment. Mt. Gox is under investigation by the U.S. federal law enforcement, according to a second source familiar with the case, while a third said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was monitoring the situation. The federal probe was spurred by information provided by the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the digital currency, Bloomberg reported. The foundation could not be reached immediately for comment. Karpeles, a founding member of the foundation, resigned from its board on Monday. In Singapore on Thursday, Tembusu Terminals set up what it said was the city-state\'s first automated tele-exchange machine (ATM) for buying bitcoins - at the downtown Spiffy Dapper bar - a week after the finance minister said bitcoins weren\'t regulated by the ministry or the central bank. Karpeles\' whereabouts in Japan were still unclear. The main Mt. Gox office remained deserted on Thursday, with bubble wrap inside the windows. The company said last week it was moving back to a previous office for "security reasons". The company\'s cubicle in the other office in Tokyo\'s Shibuya area was inaccessible. A concierge at Karpeles\' home - an upscale apartment near Shibuya - appeared to speak to someone on the intercom before saying there was nobody home.

The investments in Pantera Bitcoin Partners LLC come at a time when the virtual currency is under close scrutiny by regulators after Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy, saying hackers had taken around 850,000 bitcoins. Pantera, which was founded in 2003 and until recently focused on global macro-hedge fund investments, said it is turning its attention to investment advisory services exclusively for bitcoin, other digital currencies and other related companies. Ribbit, founded by financial services entrepreneur Micky Malka, and Fortress have committed to buying and selling virtual currencies, including bitcoin, through Pantera. Fortress Investment said last month it incurred a $3.7 million paper loss last year on an investment in bitcoin. "We believe Bitcoin is at an inflection point, making it the right time for a transition to more institutional management," said Dan Morehead, Pantera\'s founder and CEO. The collapse of Mt. Gox late last month was a setback for bitcoin, which began circulating in 2009, but many believe the virtual currency will emerge with a more robust system. Supporters of the crypto-currency expect some early investors to exit, with more experienced financial services professionals getting involved in bitcoin.

Gox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the bitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal tender, though it might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls. In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered - or more often, not covered - by existing law. The issue took on new prominence in Japan on February 28, when Mt. Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks. Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says. Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank, "we have not grasped the situation in its entirety." The authorities are monitoring the Mt. Gox bankruptcy process and, if necessary, will consider a response, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. Fewer than 1 percent of Mt. Gox\'s 127,000 creditors are Japanese, the company has said. Yet across the government, officials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin. "It\'s not money," said Finance Minister Taro Aso. "Does the Financial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance Ministry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry?" he asked at a regular news conference. "Opinions are divided." The government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and regulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within the purview of professional trading or asset management, while trading the virtual currency is not a banking or financial-instrument transaction. But, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it meets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax laws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that bitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the statement does not specify this. Regarding money laundering, certain transactions - whether with bitcoin or not - require people to identify themselves, it notes. The 6-page document is the government\'s official response to questions posed by Tsutomu Okubo, a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan Stanley.

Samman has provided BTC.sx around $250,000 in funding, which he said was the largest investment by Seedcoin so far. "This is part of the funding we\'re trying to raise and we are very close to landing additional funding," said Samman. The investment in BTC is the sixth Bitcoin-denominated position from the first SeedCoin fund. The other five businesses are Cryptopay, CoinSimple, MexBT, Hive and zSIM, Seedcoin said in a statement. SeedCoin is a startup "incubator" providing early-stage investment to digital currency companies. BTC, which started with a $150,000 investment, briefly suspended trading on its platform after its bitcoin exchange partner, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, went dark in February following weeks of turmoil. Mt. Gox eventually filed for bankruptcy protection. Prior to the suspension, BTC offered derivatives on Mt. Gox prices. Samman said the platform resumed trading on March 10 and now offers derivatives on BitStamp prices. BitStamp is a bitcoin exchange based in Slovenia and is now considered the world\'s largest based on trading volume. According to Bitcoin Charts, BitStamp has 30-day U.S. dollar volume of about $290 million. Derivatives volume has been light since BTC resumed trading, Samman said. "It has been picking up slightly. We\'re nowhere near the volumes we have seen before the collapse of Mt. Gox," Samman said. "I think that\'s just a bitcoin-wide problem at the moment." BTC has brokered more than $44 million in bitcoin derivative trades since it launched in April 2013. When Mt. Gox collapsed, BTC lost all of the bitcoins it had stored with the failed exchange. However, even before the Mt. Gox failure, BTC had already started withdrawing funds and reducing its exposure to the exchange because of worries about its future.

The sparely furnished property opened a few months ago to\nsupport a community of Bitcoin fanatics, perhaps the most active\nin the world, who are out to build just that - a next-generation\ntrading system based on the digital currency. At least two dozen startups have popped up in Israel over\nthe past year with a view to creating tools that will allow the\ncurrency to be used in almost any kind of transaction - from\nbuying shoes to sending remittances or issuing company stock. Israeli companies are pioneers in hi-tech fields like\ncryptography, fraud prevention, and semiconductors, all of which\ninteract with the Bitcoin universe. That makes the country as much of a Bitcoin hotspot as\nSingapore or California\'s Silicon Valley, says Eli Novershtern,\nprincipal of Israel\'s biggest venture capital firm Pitango,\nwhich manages assets worth over $1.6 billion. "We see a lot of activity here and are certainly looking to\ninvest (in such firms), even significant sums if we recognise an\nattractive opportunity," he said, without offering details of\nspecific plans. As a crypto-currency, Bitcoin is passed between two parties\ndigitally and can be traded on exchanges for real-world\ncurrencies. Its value fluctuates according to user demand but it\nis not backed by any government or central bank. New bitcoins come from a process called mining. Computer\nprogrammers around the world compete to crack an automatically\ngenerated code and the first to do so is rewarded with a small\nstash. This happens about every 10 minutes. The maximum potential number of bitcoins in circulation is\n21 million compared with around 12 million currently - meaning\nthat, over time, the payoffs get smaller. Enthusiasts hope the circulation limit and wider acceptance\nof the currency will mean its value goes up. One bitcoin is\ncurrently worth about $700, giving the currency a total\npotential market value of about $9 billion. As recently as 2012 it was changing hands for $10. Netanel Goldberg, 42, heads GetReal Platforms, a company he\nand two other graduates of Israel\'s military cyber intelligence\nunit founded last year. He foresees a "bloodbath" as ever stronger computer networks\ncompete to mine the most bitcoins - a market he expects to grab\na sizable chunk of, thanks to a silicon-based chip that GetReal\nis developing.   SECONDARY MARKET Bitcoin was spawned by a still unidentified developer known\nas Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, when the global financial crisis\nmeant distrust of banks and governments was high. Initially there was a libertarian appeal, said Ron Finberg,\nwho runs the website Digital Currency Magnates. But in Israel, technology had always been the currency\'s\ndriving force, he said. Now the "boundary-less system" was\nfostering ever more innovative applications. Mathematician Meni Rosenfeld said his team is developing a\nproduct called "coloured coins" that will allow bitcoins to\ncarry a secondary value, such as equity in a company. A company will be able to take small fractions of a bitcoin,\ngive them a digital marker, or "colour", and distribute them to\nshareholders. "They represent stock in every way," said Rosenfeld, who is\nalso chairman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association. The same could\nbe done with bonds or car ownership, he said.  REGULATORY RESPONSE There has been a mixed reaction to Bitcoin around the world. Supporters are drawn to its decentralised platform and say\nit is here to stay. Detractors call it a bubble and expect it to\nbe forgotten in a year or two. But its growing popularity is undeniable, and governments\nand regulators have been searching for the best way to respond. "The Bank of Israel is ...examining the need for some sort\nof regulation regarding electronic, virtual and other similar\ncurrencies," said Yoav Seffer, spokesman for the central bank. Most retailers do not accept Bitcoin, making it hard for\nusers to shop. One Tel Aviv startup, however, has shown that the\nconvenience of using digital money can draw enormous interest. AppCoin developed a programme that easily generates virtual\ncurrencies and teamed up with an online community of mothers in\na trial run. The moms were given a new tender, called "hearts",\nand agreed to use it to buy and sell items. A year later the network swelled to 50,000 members with\nhundreds of transactions carried out each day. The company plans to offer a service so anyone, anywhere can\ncreate their own currency, but for now it is focused on a\nbeta-version it just released of a Bitcoin bazaar, called\nSatoshi Marketplace, accessible by phone to anyone in the world. "Just as the internet revolutionized the way we exchange\ninformation, smartphones will redefine how people exchange value\n- by using digital currencies and virtual marketplaces," said\nEyal Hertzog, product architect at AppCoin. Last month, members of the Bitcoin community and officials\nfrom the private sector and government gathered at the Tel Aviv\nStock Exchange to discuss the future of the digital currency. The assembly was hosted by Eden Shochat, founder of venture\ncapital firm Aleph, which manages about $150 million.

Mark Karpeles, the 28-year-old French CEO of Mt. Gox, which once handled around 80 percent of the world\'s bitcoin trades, filed for bankruptcy at a Tokyo District Court late on Friday. His lawyer said that nearly all the bitcoins in the exchange\'s possession - 850,000 of them - were missing. Karpeles blamed hackers. At current bitcoin rates on other exchanges, that would mean $473 million is lost - around 7 percent of all bitcoins minted. "If the theft is true," said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University\'s Fuqua School of Business, "it\'s the biggest bank heist in history," aside from when Saddam Hussein ordered his son to withdraw $1 billion from Iraq\'s central bank in 2003. How this happened remains a mystery. But most observers say Mt. Gox\'s laxness played a key role in the debacle. "When I first signed up to it, it was clearly not fit to be a financial services company," said Jon Rushman, who researches and lectures about bitcoin at England\'s University of Warwick. But things got better, he said: "It has been a process of learn-by-doing that they have discovered all sorts of things they should be doing, but were not." No official explanation has been forthcoming beyond blaming hackers and weaknesses in Mt. Gox\'s system. A document circulating on the internet that purports to be a crisis strategy paper prepared on behalf of Mt. Gox blamed the hole on a "malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years." Mt. Gox has not confirmed the authenticity of the document. The phrase, says Ethan Heilman, a research fellow at Boston University, refers to a bug in the bitcoin process whereby someone could trick Mt. Gox into thinking a transaction had failed - and therefore keep repeating it. This, say Heilman and others, could explain the disappearance of the money - even though the bug has been known for a while, and has been fixed on other exchanges. STRETCHING CREDIBILITY More problematic is another part of the document\'s purported explanation. Usually bitcoins\' private keys - something similar to a personal bank PIN code - are stored offline, where hackers can\'t get them. This \'cold storage\' is unconnected to the online part - the hot wallet. The document says "the cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet" - a statement experts say doesn\'t make sense. If true, this suggests the vast majority of Mt. Gox\'s bitcoin deposits were leaking out without anyone noticing. This stretches credibility, says Anthony Hope, who heads compliance for Hong Kong-based bitcoin company MatrixVision. Once Mt. Gox was aware of the malleability bug, why didn\'t they check their cold storage? "This is like someone saying that you put your wine in a cellar to keep cool, then someone tells you that a particular vintage had loose corks," he said. "You\'d presumably go into the cellar to ensure your bottles were not affected." At Singapore-based Coin Of Sale, Tomas Forgac said: "If this was long-term leakage which went unnoticed, it shows an unbelievable level of incompetence." \'THOUSANDS OF SOCKS\' If the bitcoins have been stolen, the thief or thieves would have several options to convert them into cash, said Boston University\'s Heilman. They could have used a "mixing service" to mix one group of funds with those of other people. They could also have used a service like localbitcoins.com to trade bitcoins for cash in person. "There are many possibilities for cashing out, although fencing this many bitcoins would be difficult," he said. To do that, says Charles McFarland, a research engineer at online security company McAfee, the thief or thieves would have to conceal their tracks by spreading the bitcoin around prior to laundering it into cash. Trying to do so from a single bitcoin wallet would have been like stuffing thousands of socks in a dryer while everyone else is throwing in only a single pair. "For this reason it\'s a safe bet to say the stolen bitcoins are most likely paid out in numerous wallets so each transaction can hide among the trees," McFarland said. That, he said, would make it "expensive, if not impossible, to track." Knowing whether this was theft or negligence, or both, will take time, and may never happen. U.S. federal prosecutors have subpoenaed Mt. Gox - and other bitcoin businesses - to seek information on a spate of disruptive cyber attacks. But bitcoin is an unregulated industry, requires no technical audits or risk management procedures - and offers few ways of prosecuting those who might have acted illegally, says Zennon Kapron, who runs a finance consultancy in Shanghai. "The unfortunate part is that we may never know exactly how this happened," he says.

"It was agreed to continue to examine various perspectives\nrelated to the use of, and trade in, virtual currencies," the\nauthorities said in a joint statement on Wednesday. "These perspectives include possible macro effects, their\nlegal standing, their regulation, money laundering and terror\nfinancing risks, taxation and consumer protection." They said the Israeli public should be aware that bitcoin is\nunsupervised, is not legal tender and presents fertile ground\nfor fraudulent activities. At the same time, such transactions\nare anonymous and often hard to trace, they added.  CRIMINAL ACTIVITY "This anonymity is liable to be exploited for criminal\nactivity, including money laundering, financing illegal\nactivities and financing terrorism," the statement said. "Law enforcement authorities are therefore likely to close\ntrading platforms in virtual currencies which are used for\nillegitimate activities, by preventing access or use of\ncustomers\' capital, which would likely be held by those\nplatforms," the statement added.

One bitcoin is currently worth about $700, giving the currency a total potential market value of about $9 billion. As recently as 2012 it was changing hands for $10. Netanel Goldberg, 42, heads GetReal Platforms, a company he and two other graduates of Israel\'s military cyber intelligence unit founded last year. He foresees a "bloodbath" as ever stronger computer networks compete to mine the most bitcoins - a market he expects to grab a sizable chunk of, thanks to a silicon-based chip that GetReal is developing. SECONDARY MARKET Bitcoin was spawned by a still unidentified developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, when the global financial crisis meant distrust of banks and governments was high. Initially there was a libertarian appeal, said Ron Finberg, who runs the website Digital Currency Magnates. But in Israel, technology had always been the currency\'s driving force, he said. Now the "boundary-less system" was fostering ever more innovative applications. Mathematician Meni Rosenfeld said his team is developing a product called "colored coins" that will allow bitcoins to carry a secondary value, such as equity in a company. A company will be able to take small fractions of a bitcoin, give them a digital marker, or "color", and distribute them to shareholders. "They represent stock in every way," said Rosenfeld, who is also chairman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association. The same could be done with bonds or car ownership, he said. REGULATORY RESPONSE There has been a mixed reaction to Bitcoin around the world. Supporters are drawn to its decentralized platform and say it is here to stay. Detractors call it a bubble and expect it to be forgotten in a year or two. But its growing popularity is undeniable, and governments and regulators have been searching for the best way to respond. "The Bank of Israel is ...examining the need for some sort of regulation regarding electronic, virtual and other similar currencies," said Yoav Seffer, spokesman for the central bank. Most retailers do not accept Bitcoin, making it hard for users to shop. One Tel Aviv startup, however, has shown that the convenience of using digital money can draw enormous interest. AppCoin developed a program that easily generates virtual currencies and teamed up with an online community of mothers in a trial run. The moms were given a new tender, called "hearts", and agreed to use it to buy and sell items. A year later the network swelled to 50,000 members with hundreds of transactions carried out each day. The company plans to offer a service so anyone, anywhere can create their own currency, but for now it is focused on a beta-version it just released of a Bitcoin bazaar, called Satoshi Marketplace, accessible by phone to anyone in the world. "Just as the internet revolutionized the way we exchange information, smartphones will redefine how people exchange value - by using digital currencies and virtual marketplaces," said Eyal Hertzog, product architect at AppCoin. Last month, members of the Bitcoin community and officials from the private sector and government gathered at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to discuss the future of the digital currency. The assembly was hosted by Eden Shochat, founder of venture capital firm Aleph, which manages about $150 million. "The ability to transfer value in a frictionless way without transaction fees represents a tidal wave, and when that happens our role is to help, advise and fund these kinds of companies," he said.

Charlie Shrem, who had financial backing from the Winklevoss twins and is well known as one of the bitcoin\'s biggest global promoters, was arrested on Sunday at John. F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office in Manhattan said on Monday. Shrem, who was also charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, appeared in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Monday and was released on $1 million bond. "At this point the allegations in the complaint are simply allegations, and Mr. Shrem is presumed innocent," his lawyer Keith Miller said. The 24-year-old entrepreneur, who lives above a bar he jointly owns in Manhattan that accepts bitcoins as payment, was CEO of BitInstant, a bitcoin exchange company that closed last summer. According to prosecutors, Shrem conspired with a Florida resident, Robert Faiella, who ran an illegal exchange, to sell more than $1 million in bitcoins to users of Silk Road, which was shuttered by authorities last year. Faiella, 52, is also charged in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was arrested at his home in Coral Gables, Florida. At his court hearing on Monday in federal court in Florida, Faiella consented to detention until Wednesday, at which point there will be a bail hearing. Shrem could not be reached for comment. A person who answered the phone at Faiella\'s house and declined to be identified said, "Nobody wants to talk." Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not backed by a government or central bank and whose value fluctuates according to demand by users. Users can transfer bitcoins to each other over the Internet and store the currency in digital "wallets." The criminal complaint says that Shrem, in addition to knowing that Faiella\'s business was funneling money into Silk Road, also used Silk Road himself to buy drugs, including marijuana-infused brownies. "When Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act," Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, said in a statement emailed to the press on Monday. "We will aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes." Bharara has said recently that prosecutors are not going after Bitcoin itself and view it as they view any other currency in which transactions are sometimes made illegally. U.S. law enforcement officials have vowed to pursue any criminal activity in the nascent Bitcoin world as regulators try to formulate their approach to the digital currency. The charging of a prominent Bitcoin Foundation official may be a blow to Bitcoin\'s prospects, though it did not have a huge immediate impact on trading. Bitcoins were exchanging hands at $970 late on Monday, down from prices above $1,000 earlier this month but up from around $150 four months ago on the Tokyo-based exchange MtGox. Winklevoss Capital, which is run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, invested in BitInstant in 2012 and led a capital-raising effort last May that raised $1.5 million. The twins, who are best known for their failed lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in which they had claimed he had stolen their idea for an online social networking platform at Harvard, have been seeking regulatory approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. "When we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws - including money laundering laws - and we expected nothing less," the Winkelvoss twins said in a statement. "Although BitInstant is not named in today\'s indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest," they said. "We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials." As part of the conditions of his bail, Shrem will be confined to his parents\' home in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn. A report prepared by the court for his bail hearing listed his net worth at $6 million, according to U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman. Serrin Turner, an assistant U.S. attorney, opposed bail, saying Shrem had a "strong incentive to flee" and the means to do so. Bitcoin insiders said Shrem\'s arrest showed just how hard it is to get away with illegal activity using Bitcoin, which has an ownership chain built into its software so that each unit can be tied to the users who have acquired or spent it. "Using bitcoin for illicit transactions is really, really dumb," said Patrick Murck, the Bitcoin Foundation\'s general counsel. "Bitcoins are so easy to track." "THE ART OF HIDING" According to the charges, Faiella, going by "BTCKing" online, sold bitcoins to Silk Road users and passed on purchase orders he received from the site to Shrem, who filled them, transferring funds to Faiella\'s account at an unidentified bitcoin exchange service based in Japan. The charging document says that Shrem failed to report suspicious activity to regulators "with respect to numerous Bitcoin purchases" Faiella made from BitInstant. The document contains email conversations between Shrem and BitInstant\'s co-founder, who is not identified in the charges but is listed on BitInstant\'s website as Gareth Nelson, in which Shrem tried to hide his dealings with Faiella by pretending to ban him from BitInstant\'s exchange platform. "You are hereby banned from our services," he wrote in an email to BTCKing that he copied to Nelson. According to the complaint, Shrem then privately wrote to BTCKing, without including Nelson. "Your email address is banned," Shrem wrote, "but you can use a different one." Bitcoins have been gaining wider acceptance recently. The Sacramento Kings basketball team earlier this month became the first professional sports franchise to say it would allow purchases using bitcoins. Last month, ecommerce site Overstock.com announced its plan to become the first major U.S. retailer to accept the digital currency. Created in 2009 by a developer or team of developers going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity remains unknown, the bitcoin\'s earliest adopters have included people expressing a desire to conduct their affairs in a realm outside of government-sanctioned commercial spaces. Some of that sentiment is visible in the charges against Shrem and Faiella. In one online interaction, Shrem tried to assure Faiella he was being discreet. "The art of hiding is making people think you are someone else," he wrote. Faiella replied: "You must understand that the people that we pay taxes to have a long reach and I like to stay away from that."

In order to avoid such a "Grexit" some reckon Greece could adopt a bitcoin-like parallel digital currency with which it could pay its pensioners and public-sector workers. It could be called the "digi-drachma", after Greece\'s pre-euro currency.  But unlike bitcoin, which is totally decentralized and given value simply by its usefulness, it would be issued by the state and backed with the country\'s substantial assets.  "If you\'ve got all these assets, why don\'t you use them to back up a digital currency?" said Lee Gibson-Grant, founder of Coinstructors, a consultancy for those wanting to use bitcoin\'s underlying technology -- the blockchain -- to start businesses. If Greece\'s assets could be tokenized and issued as a digital currency, argues Gibson-Grant, public-sector wages and pensions could be paid with it. That would preserve scarce euros for repaying the country\'s creditors and help avoid a sell-off of valuable assets at rock-bottom prices. Varoufakis himself, who on April 1 tweeted a link to a satirical story that reported him as saying Greece would adopt bitcoin if a deal with its creditors could not be reached, blogged in 2014 about the possibility of a parallel "Future Tax (FT) coin". The FT coin, said Varoufakis, an academic economist whose radical-left Syriza party was then not yet in government, would be denominated in euros but backed by future tax revenues.  It would use a "bitcoin-like algorithm in order to make the system transparent, efficient and transactions-cost-free" and could provide "a source of liquidity for the governments that is outside the bond markets".   IOU CURRENCY Greece\'s radical left is not alone in having considered a parallel currency. The European Central Bank has analyzed a scenario in which Greece pays civil servants with IOUs, which would rely on future tax revenue in a similar way to the FT coin, creating a virtual second currency in the euro bloc. ECB experts decided it would not work, as public sector workers would receive payment in the IOU currency rather than in euros, putting further pressure on Greek banks because those workers were likely then to plunder their savings.  Furthermore, the basis for both such ideas relies on an implicit assumption that the Greek state will not collapse -- by no means guaranteed in the current climate.  "This would be different to a distributed, trustless digital currency such as bitcoin, since holders would still have to trust the issuer," said Tom Robinson, Chief Operating Officer at London-based bitcoin storage firm Elliptic. For Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics who specializes in alternative currencies, the problem with such a plan is that it does not deal with Greece\'s most basic problem: the need to reduce its debt burden.   "There is a precedent for parallel currencies working," said Hileman. "But the fundamental issue in Greece is the size of the debt and the fact that the economy is not growing, and you\'ve got to find some way to in effect reduce that debt burden in Greece."  If a digital currency has no place in a solution for Greece, the blockchain technology behind bitcoin -- a globally distributed ledger of all of bitcoin\'s transactions that is evolving beyond the world of digital currencies -- might do.  The government of Honduras, for example, has recently gone into partnership with Texas-based technology firm Factom to build a secure and immutable land title record system using the blockchain to mitigate against fraud. And CEO Peter Kirby reckons Greece could use a similar system to deal with its tax-dodgers. "With a true global distributed ledger that basically keeps track of everything that happens, you can start putting a lot more transparency into the way the Greek government does its business," Kirby said.

Gox said a halt\non withdrawals it announced on Friday would continue\nindefinitely after it detected "unusual activity." The bitcoin price varied dramatically from one exchange to\nanother, with Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the best known operator of a\nbitcoin digital marketplace, recording one of the biggest drops\nfor the day. On the Mt. Gox platform the currency plunged to as low as\n$500 early on Monday, down more than 27 percent from Friday\'s\nfinal price of $692, according to the Mt. Gox website. It last\ntraded at $597, off nearly 14 percent from Friday. The price started falling fast on Friday when Mt. Gox said\nit was temporarily halting withdrawals due to unexplained\ntechnical issues. In an updated statement on Monday, Mt. Gox said withdrawals\nwere on hold indefinitely after it "has detected unusual\nactivity on its bitcoin wallets and performed investigations\nduring the past weeks. This confirmed the presence of\ntransactions which need to be examined more closely." Mt. Gox said a "bug in the bitcoin software" could allow\ntransaction details to be altered. In effect, someone on the network could alter transaction\ndetails to make it appear a transfer of bitcoins from one\ndigital wallet to another had not occurred when in fact it had.\nThis might cause the transfer to be repeated. A bitcoin wallet is an application that stores bitcoins for\nthe currency\'s users. Mt. Gox said the issue was not limited to the exchange and\n"affects all transactions where bitcoins are being sent to a\nthird party." It said the withdrawal suspension would be in\neffect until the issue has been resolved. CoinDesk, which launched the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index in\nSeptember, removed Mt. Gox from its index Monday, citing its\n"persistent failure to meet the index\'s standards for\ninclusion." "These recent withdrawal restrictions are just the latest\nin a series of issues which have made Mt. Gox\'s inclusion in the\nBPI problematic," CoinDesk said. On CoinDesk\'s bitcoin index, the bitcoin price was lower but\nnot by nearly as much as on the Mt. Gox platform. The CoinDesk\nindex showed bitcoin at $662.51 on Monday afternoon, only about\n6 percent lower from Friday\'s close of $703.57. Its low for the\nday was around $540 versus $500 on Mt. Gox.

The Edmonton, Alberta-based company reported the theft of 896 bitcoins on its website on Monday and said it "does not have the resources (or) assets ... to come back from this loss." It blamed the attack on hackers who had targeted its online wallet. Bitcoins stored in Flexcoin\'s cold storage facility, which is basically an offline bank, were not affected by the hack and will be returned to customers, the company said. The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) said on Wednesday they were investigating the issue. "I can confirm that detectives from the EPS Economic Crimes Section and Technological Crimes Unit are following up with Flexcoin, and the matter is currently under investigation," said police spokesman Chad Orydzuk. Flexcoin\'s demise comes close on the heels of the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world\'s dominant bitcoin exchange, which filed for bankruptcy last week after it said it had lost some 850,000 bitcoins. Bitcoin is a digital currency that is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network, independent of any central bank or government. Its value soared last year, and the total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion. Flexcoin had earlier on Wednesday complained that local authorities were not taking the theft seriously, Tweeting: "My attempts to file a police report were laughed at, I was advised #bitcoin is a scam." But it later Tweeted that it had been in touch with police and would provide more information on Thursday. While bitcoins are an unregulated currency, a hacker that breaks into a computer to steal bitcoins can be charged with unauthorized access to a computer and mischief to data. LITTLE RECOURSE Flexcoin users who lost bitcoins in the hack will likely have little recourse to recoup their funds, though one option may be a class action lawsuit like the one being considered against Mt. Gox, said Stuart Hoegner, a Toronto-based lawyer and general counsel for the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. "Short of a class action, people might find the burden of pursuing litigation to be something that\'s not very attractive," he said. Another option might be through any potential bankruptcy proceedings for the company, though the outcome of either possibility would likely depend on the state of Flexcoin\'s books, said Hoegner. Flexcoin was incorporated in Alberta in 2012 and registered to a rented mailbox in the city of Edmonton, according to provincial records. Its sole director and voting shareholder is James Andrew Gray, who also gave the rented mailbox as his address. The corporate data did not include a phone number or other means of contacting Gray. He did not respond to queries sent to the Flexcoin Twitter account and the Flexcoin email address or efforts to reach him through social media. An online forum posted on BitcoinTalk.org in March 2012 said Gray bought Flexcoin from U.S. firm Yooter Interactive Marketing. Yooter posted a message on its website on Tuesday saying it had not had any contact with Flexcoin or Gray since the deal closed and had exited the bitcoin business entirely. Flexcoin\'s website directed users who had lost funds to its terms of service, which state that the company will take every precaution to defend client bitcoins, but "is not responsible for insuring any bitcoins stored in the Flexcoin system." It further states: "You agree to not hold Flexcoin Inc, or Flexcoin Inc\'s stakeholders, or Flexcoin Inc\'s shareholders liable for any lost bitcoins." THE WILD WEST The very public downfalls of Mt. Gox and Flexcoin come as bitcoin inches ever closer to the mainstream, with major online retailers like Overstock.com and TigerDirect.com now accepting the digital currency.

As a crypto-currency, bitcoin is passed between two parties digitally and can be traded on exchanges for real-world currencies. Its value fluctuates according to user demand but it is not backed by any government or central bank. Supporters of bitcoin are drawn to its decentralized platform and say it is here to stay. Detractors call it a bubble and expect it to be forgotten in a year or two. However, it has proved increasingly popular and governments and regulators around the world have been searching for the best way to respond. Israel, home to pioneering firms in hi-tech fields such as cryptography, has emerged as a bitcoin hotspot, prompting central bank governor Karnit Flug to convene a meeting this week with other regulators, including those for capital markets, taxes, securities and money laundering and terror financing. "It was agreed to continue to examine various perspectives related to the use of, and trade in, virtual currencies," the authorities said in a joint statement on Wednesday. "These perspectives include possible macro effects, their legal standing, their regulation, money laundering and terror financing risks, taxation and consumer protection." They said the Israeli public should be aware that bitcoin is unsupervised, is not legal tender and presents fertile ground for fraudulent activities. At the same time, such transactions are anonymous and often hard to trace, they added. CRIMINAL ACTIVITY "This anonymity is liable to be exploited for criminal activity, including money laundering, financing illegal activities and financing terrorism," the statement said. "Law enforcement authorities are therefore likely to close trading platforms in virtual currencies which are used for illegitimate activities, by preventing access or use of customers\' capital, which would likely be held by those platforms," the statement added. Other governments have also issued warnings on the use of bitcoin and New York\'s financial regulator revealed plans this month to govern virtual currency firms in the state in order to protect consumers and combat money laundering. At least two dozen Israeli startups have popped up in the past year with a view to creating tools that will allow bitcoin to be used in almost any kind of transaction - from buying shoes to issuing company stock. In recent weeks, bitcoin was hit by attacks from unknown computer hackers that led to problems at two exchanges. They had to temporarily halt withdrawals by customers who stored bitcoins in digital wallets provided by the exchanges. This week, a bitcoin is worth about $635, down from around the $1,000 mark in late 2013. However, it was worth only about $150 as recently as last September.

Regulators have stepped up their efforts to rein in bitcoin after incidents such as the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins. The novelty of the technology has made it hard for regulators to categorize bitcoin, but trading derivatives such as futures or swaps would subject companies to oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. "Let me tell you, (if) they\'ve got a derivatives contract, we have jurisdiction... and we should regulate it," Bart Chilton, a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told Reuters in an interview. In the past 30 days, a number of companies requested information to see what the rules were for setting up a market place to trade bitcoin derivatives, Chilton said. "These are people that are inquiring about what they should do if they wanted to request (official) status," he said. He declined to name the companies, which have not officially filed any paperwork to get legal status, he said. Chilton is set to leave the commission on Friday after more than six years with the regulator. Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers and is independent of control, or any backing, by a government or a central bank - something its proponents like, but that also makes it vulnerable to mishaps. New York state\'s top financial services regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, has been the most vocal about regulating bitcoin, saying last week that he wants prospective virtual currency exchange operators to submit formal applications. The CFTC, which regulates futures and swaps, is also studying whether it should regulate the new electronic currencies, its head said last week.

Gox, was a bright child, but a poor student, a lousy communicator and "too conciliatory", allowing others to take advantage of him, his mother Anne said in a telephone interview. Speaking from her home in Switzerland last week, Anne, 57, said Karpeles was a "terrible" student, but was admitted to Mensa, a global society of those with a high IQ, as a teenager. He loved computing from a very early age. Mt. Gox, at one point last year the world\'s biggest exchange for the bitcoin digital currency, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in late February, blaming hacking of its computer system for the loss of bitcoins worth more than $450 million at today\'s rates. Recalling Karpeles\' early days in Dijon in the Burgundy region of France, his mother said: "Difficult, never. Too conciliatory for a few things. Someone who is extremely nice and who has a tendency to let himself get taken for a ride by others. People who took advantage of him, who asked him to do their homework." "He was a terrible student. Terrible. Most subjects didn\'t interest him. He took a Mensa test, passed it and was admitted into Mensa ... during his teenage years. Prodigies understand things straight away, but you don\'t learn without repetition, without exercises. But that he didn\'t understand," she said. Mensa didn\'t respond to Reuters requests for confirmation of Karpeles\' membership. Slipping between calling her son Mark, and his family name of Robert, Anne recalled his difficult childhood, saying she herself came from a family she described as "vertical". "My grandmother lived alone, my mother lived alone and I lived alone. My son was born into a single-parent home. My mother was someone who was pretty harsh and difficult ... for all sorts of reasons," she said. YOUNG PROGRAMMER A young Karpeles was shuffled from school to school. At one, Anne said, "he had big problems with the teacher. Robert didn\'t get along with her at all." "I tried to do as best I could my job as a mother. I tried to open the most doors I could for him, introducing him to drawing, music, cookery, sewing and also computing, because I love computing." "Computing was his thing. We began programming in BASIC on our little Sinclair (computer). This was around when he was 5 or 6. He loved it," she said. "He didn\'t go to university. He failed badly in his second-last year of high school and decided to quit. I told him that if he was going to do that he should become a plumber, so he got an electrician\'s diploma. Then one day, I saw him walking around with a huge book, called "PHP". He told me he had become a doctor in PHP," a computer programming language. After a brief, unsuccessful attempt to set up a server company in Israel - "the electricity grid was bombed and the power was out for days," she recalled - Karpeles joined a software distribution firm called Nexway, was promoted and, in 2009, was offered a post in Japan. "For him, it was the doorway to his dream, he adored Japan. When he was young and we were living in Paris we went regularly to exhibitions at the Japanese Cultural Center. He learned business Japanese before leaving." POOR COMMUNICATOR As mother and son drifted apart, Karpeles married without telling her and only let her know she was a grandmother after his son was born. "(Mark\'s) communication at a personal level is catastrophic. It\'s always been difficult to get him to speak. We tried to get him to be more extrovert ... Sometimes I wonder whether it\'s not some kind of trauma linked to my mother. I had the same problem when I was younger." "There have been psychological profiles of Mark ... when he was admitted to Mensa. Prodigy, that was clear. Sometimes his problems communicating were recognized and other times not, depending on the profiler," she recalled. The first Anne heard of the blowout at Mt. Gox was when a local reporter telephoned her. "I didn\'t even know Mark was the boss," she recalled. "I had to look it up on Wikipedia." "As I understand it, he was hacked. All the accounts were emptied. He\'s in a situation like a bank director who\'s suffered a hold-up." Mt. Gox now faces liquidation after a Tokyo court last week dismissed the company\'s bid to resuscitate its business, and the court-appointed administrator said Karpeles is likely to be investigated for liability in the exchange\'s collapse. Bitcoin investors in the United States have launched a class action lawsuit alleging possible fraud by Mt. Gox insiders, including Karpeles. "I don\'t understand (the fraud accusations). I would never say it\'s unthinkable, but Mark is my son, and my job as a mother is to do what I can for my son. That said, if genuinely there was dishonesty, I will not cover for him." "That would shock me though because I\'ve never seen him do anything dishonest. He has sometimes trusted in people who were dishonest." Asked about Karpeles\' own admission in a 2006 blog post that he had two computer fraud-related convictions before he was 21, she said: "No, no, I don\'t think there was ever any conviction. I don\'t know. There are maybe things he hid from me." TOKYO TRIP Anne visited Karpeles in Japan, her first trip there, for 10 days from late-November last year, meeting his Japanese wife and their 2-year-old son Pierre. "(The wife) has gone to Canada to live ... that didn\'t really help Mark, with all that\'s happening," Anne said, though she said she has more contact today with the wife than she does with her son. As the situation at Mt. Gox unraveled in early December, she recalled how Karpeles battled to counter a hacking attack on the exchange. "He had to create a program to fight the hack, and he succeeded. He spent practically all night at work." "I could have fired a cannon next to him and he wouldn\'t have noticed. He was so serious, concentrated - unlike when he was a boy," she said.

Slovenia-based Bitstamp, among the largest bitcoin exchanges, said on its website that developers had come up with a solution to thwart the cyber attacks against its platform that had forced the hiatus. It suspended withdrawals on Tuesday, days after one of the best known exchanges, Mt. Gox, suspended withdrawals indefinitely. "After additional testing, we plan to enable bitcoin withdrawals later today," Bitstamp\'s statement said. Mt. Gox has not yet resumed withdrawals and has not issued a public update on the matter since Monday. Bitcoin prices continued their pattern of volatile trading on Friday, and prices varied widely by exchange. On Mt. Gox, where trading has continued despite the withdrawal suspension, the price plunged to as low as $302 early on Friday, but recovered later in the day following the Bitstamp announcement, last trading at $443, down about 7.5 percent from Thursday. "The news that Bitstamp is resuming withdrawals restored some confidence and prompted people to buy back bitcoin," said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. "The fear trade seems to have dissipated." At CoinDesk, which this week excluded Mt. Gox data from its Bitcoin Price Index, the currency\'s price was substantially higher. There, bitcoin was quoted at $647.12, up more than 8 percent on the day. Adding to the choppiness were reports that the online drugs marketplace Silk Road 2 had been hacked and drained of about $2.7 million worth of the digital currency. CNN said the site\'s administrator posted the news late on Thursday. The first Silk Road site, which like its successor was accessible only using a special program that hides users\' physical locations, was shut down last year by U.S. law enforcement authorities, and the man authorities say was behind its operations was arrested and charged with narcotics trafficking and money laundering. "There should be no impact on bitcoin prices based on the reduction of illegal activity," said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York. "It really indicates that there\'s nervousness in the market." Galy said seasoned traders likely bought bitcoin after its price dropped. "Professional traders would recognize that there is overselling based on irrational fears," he said.

And it could get much bigger. Federal authorities hauled in 29,655 units of the digital currency - worth $27 million at current exchange rates - through an official forfeiture by Bitcoin this week. The bitcoins had belonged to Silk Road, an anonymous online black market that authorities say was a conduit for purchases of drugs and computer hacking services - even a place where assassins may have advertised. It was shuttered after an FBI raid in September, when agents took control of its server and arrested the man they say was its founder in San Francisco. No one stepped forward to claim these bitcoins, which were found in electronic "wallets" used to store the digital currency. An additional 144,336 bitcoins, worth more than $128 million today, were also discovered, but the government\'s claim on them is being disputed by Ross William Ulbricht, 29, who U.S. authorities say was the founder and main operator of Silk Road. They had been stashed on his laptop. It all puts authorities in an unusual position, given their concerns about the way in which bitcoins and other digital currencies are used by criminals to circumvent regulations intended to prevent money laundering. By trading in bitcoins, the government could give the currency some legitimacy. Bitcoin is essentially software code that defines units of value, which users can move back and forth among themselves. Unlike other virtual money transmitters, its value isn\'t pegged to a hard currency like the dollar or the euro; it is determined by the demand for bitcoins. The U.S. Marshals Service, which is in charge of liquidating such seized assets, will have to decide whether to sell the units on a Bitcoin exchange or find a private buyer, perhaps through an auction. A spokeswoman for Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for New York\'s Southern District, said Friday that the government is still trying to decide what to do with the forfeited bitcoins. The timing of any sale could make a big difference in the amount the government could realize. Bitcoin\'s value has fluctuated wildly over the past six months. When Silk Road was seized, the bitcoins found on the server were worth $3.6 million, far below their current $27 million value. Friday\'s exchange rate was about $900 per bitcoin, according to the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange MtGox. It is unclear whether a large sale of bitcoins by the government could drive down the price. Friday\'s volume on MtGox, which is the largest Bitcoin exchange, was 8,656 units. "If it\'s worth $27 million now, is that a high part of the market? A low part of the market? That\'s one of the decisions they\'re going to have to make," said Louis Rulli, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. "It would seem to me that they would probably convert those bitcoins into cash relatively quickly." Barry Silbert, the founder of one of the first investment funds that lets retail investors gain exposure to Bitcoin, declined to offer an opinion on what the government should do with its stash or how a sale would affect the market. Marco Santori, chairman of the regulatory affairs committee for the Bitcoin Foundation, which is Bitcoin\'s official trade group, said the group did not have an official position on the matter. \'THIS WON\'T BE DIFFICULT\' Most goods seized by U.S. authorities end up in the hands of the U.S. Marshals, where they are auctioned or, at times, repurposed for government use. But the Marshals aren\'t just practiced at unloading forfeited SUVs or houses; they also deal with complex financial instruments, foreign companies and other kinds of obscure assets forfeited by criminals. "While Bitcoin is a somewhat new form of asset, it\'s not unusual for them to have to find out how to liquidate a new asset," said Jeffrey Alberts, a partner at Pryor Cashman and a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan. "This won\'t be difficult for them, whether they do it through an exchange or find a buyer who wants to buy it directly from them." Ulbricht was arrested October 1 in a San Francisco public library and charged by prosecutors in New York with one count each of money laundering, computer hacking and drug trafficking. He is being held at a federal detention center in New York without bail. He has not entered a formal plea but has maintained his innocence through statements by his lawyer. Prosecutors last week asked a judge to grant them a default judgment in the civil forfeiture case they filed after the raid on Silk Road and Ulbricht\'s arrest claiming Silk Road\'s assets. U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken signed an order to that effect on Wednesday, giving the government control of the 29,655 Bitcoins from Silk Road\'s server but not of the bitcoins - the larger sum - discovered on Ulbricht\'s computer. Those are still in dispute. The proceeds from any sale would be turned over to an asset forfeiture fund from which the U.S. Justice Department can draw for law enforcement activities. If any money were to come back to prosecutors\' budgets, it would be distributed evenly among U.S. attorneys\' offices, a policy meant to prevent individual offices from unduly seizing assets to pad their budgets.

Investment has jumped in recent months as Bitcoin, the prominent digital currency not backed by a government or central bank, has begun to gain a footing among businesses and consumers, a key step for it to go mainstream. Startups such as Coinbase and BitPay Inc, which help facilitate bitcoin adoption by merchants and consumers, have raised millions of dollars so far. Interest is also growing in bitcoin trading, investment funds, and "mining" - the process of creating the digital currency. Bitcoin, until recently a niche alternative currency touted by computer geeks and anti-government advocates, has garnered attention from a growing list of notable investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, which has invested in Facebook Inc, Twitter and Groupon Inc, and Founders Fund, which includes three founders of PayPal. Some devotees promote Bitcoin, which exists solely in cyber form, as the future of money, and in some investing circles it has created a buzz reminiscent of the early Internet age. "What keeps me up at night is \'are we missing out on investments?\' because if this is what I think it can be, we will regret not being even more active," said Micky Malka, founder of Palo Alto, California-based Ribbit Capital, which has invested in three bitcoin firms, including San Francisco-based Coinbase. Bitcoin startups raised nearly $12 million from venture capital investors in seven deals in the three months ended June, according to CB Insights, a New York-based venture capital data firm. That compares with just five deals totaling less than $2 million in the previous four quarters. More money is expected to flow into the bitcoin market, where the amount of venture capital financing remains modest compared with some sectors like social networking. Some industry participants estimate available money for funding ranges from $65 million to $100 million, while the number of bitcoin startups in the United States is probably in the hundreds. Last week, SecondMarket, a platform for facilitating investment in privately held companies, launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which allows sophisticated investors to gain exposure to the price movement of Bitcoin without the risks of direct bitcoin ownership. The move comes three months after Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers famous for their legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of Facebook, filed plans to launch the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded product that would allow investors to trade the digital currency like stocks. There are 11.7 million bitcoins in circulation, with a market capitalization of over $1.7 billion. The price of bitcoin is currently around $142, down from more than $250 in April. Investors say they expect Bitcoin to grow in popularity in businesses related to storage, payment processing, remittance and micro transactions. The key is finding the right entrepreneurs to build the best consumer-friendly applications. Coinbase, a virtual wallet and platform where merchants and consumers can do business using Bitcoin, said on its website that it has about 282,000 users and handles 175,000 transactions a month. The firm has raised more than $6 million. Fees charged by bitcoin firms are typically far less than those charged by banks, credit card companies or other online payment processors. Coinbase charges merchants a 1 percent fee to convert Bitcoin into local currencies, but is currently waiving it for the first $1 million. Atlanta-based BitPay charges a flat 0.99 percent fee. The firm, which has raised $2.7 million, said over 10,000 approved merchants in 164 countries use its platform to accept bitcoin payments. Supporters say using Bitcoin offers benefits including faster speed, lower fraud risk and increased privacy, though critics argue the anonymity it offers makes the currency a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. HIGHLY RISKY Regulators have ramped up scrutiny of digital currencies. In August, New York\'s top banking regulator issued subpoenas to about two dozen companies associated with Bitcoin. Earlier this year, U.S. prosecutors accused Liberty Reserve\'s Costa Rica-based operations of laundering about $6 billion. Legal troubles can also deter investors. In July, a lawsuit was filed against New York-based BitInstant LLC, accusing the firm of making "false representations about its services and the inflated fees that it failed to refund as promised." BitInstant operates a platform for bitcoin transfers and has received $1.5 million from the Winklevoss brothers. BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem said the firm "is committed to doing the right thing and it will be vigorously defending itself against these allegations, which it believes are not true." Bitcoin advocates say a lot of the concerns have to do with fear of the unknown, and more regulatory clarity will bolster the currency\'s use. Until then, bitcoin investing will remain highly speculative. An added risk is that, unlike investing in startups in established areas such as social media, generating long-running returns from a bitcoin company relies on the currency proving to be more than a passing fad. Even some active players do not give high odds to that: BitPay Co-founder and CEO Anthony Gallippi estimates an 80 percent chance the value of bitcoin could go to zero. Still, given the prospect, however slim, for a big windfall, investors with the right risk tolerance are finding it appealing. "We believe that bitcoin may have significant upside given the size and scope of the industries that potentially are impacted by bitcoin," said SecondMarket Founder and CEO Barry Silbert in New York. "However, bitcoin also faces regulatory uncertainty and widespread adoption issues that make investing in bitcoin a highly risky endeavor."

The shuttering this week of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and\nfears that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the virtual\ncurrency have been lost or stolen are pushing investors to\ntighten their security. Touted by advocates as a new, digital type of money that\ncould one day replace real-world cash, bitcoins can also be\nstored like traditional currencies, locked up in a safe, or\nhidden in a shoe box. Enthusiasts around the world use online exchanges to\nconveniently buy and sell bitcoins but bitcoin savings can also\nbe kept closer to home. Every virtual wallets used to hold bitcoins has a unique,\nprivate number. Recording that number on a piece of paper or a\nthumb drive, for instance, keeps a wallet\'s contents out of\nreach of anyone online, criminal or not. Canadian mortgage broker and bitcoin enthusiast Chung Cheong\nwrites out his secret number by hand and puts it in a safety\ndeposit box. "The only way to ever access that address and those bitcoins\nis that piece of paper," said Cheong. "I pray that there isn\'t a\nbig fire and the bank burns down. Because if that happens, I\'m\nout of luck." Jacob Dienelt helps run Lazzerbee, a company that lets\npeople create novelty paper wallets containing small amounts of\nbitcoins as birthday gifts or for other special occasions. He said he keeps about three quarters of his own bitcoins\nlocked away far from the Internet, with the rest on devices\nready to trade. Locking away all bitcoins offline won\'t help the\ncurrency go mainstream, though, he said. "You have to be able to spend bitcoins," he said. Bitcoin relies on a network of computers that solve complex\nmathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and\npermanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction\nthat is made. Mt. Gox was once the largest bitcoin exchange, making its\ncollapse particularly notable, but online robbery has been a\npersistent problem for the virtual currency, which began\ncirculating in 2009. Cyber criminals have infected hundreds of thousands of\ncomputers with a virus called "Pony" to steal bitcoins and other\ndigital currencies, security firm Trustwave said this week. The apparent demise of Mt. Gox, along with a massive cyber\nattack against online exchanges earlier this month, is\nundoubtedly making people take a second look at where they store\ntheir virtual currencies, said Vinny Lingham, cofounder of Gyft,\nwhich sells retail gift cards and does much of its trade in\nbitcoins. While storing bitcoins offline keeps them safe from the\nclutches of cyber-criminals, it creates the very real risk of\nbreak-ins and potentially violent robbery. Some people tear the pages containing their wallet numbers\nin half and store each part in a separate location, Lingham\nsaid. Unsurprisingly, Lingham declined to say where Gyft keeps its\nbitcoins: "You can store them on paper, with your attorneys, on\nan SD card.

Joseph Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Commission, said he decided to issue the alert after reviewing dozens of complaints from around the United States from consumers who are unable to withdraw their money from bitcoin exchanges. The vast majority of the complaints were about Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that suspended withdrawals indefinitely on February 7 after it detected "unusual activity." The company is having both "security and technical challenges," according to an update on its website dated February 20. Some consumers, however, have been trying to get their money out for as long as four months, Borg said. Their initial deposits ranged from a few hundred dollars to $100,000, he said. The figures are a concern because they suggest that smaller, "Main Street" investors are among those taking chances on the digital currency, said Borg, former president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, a group composed mostly of U.S. securities regulators. Bitcoin exchanges allow their users to trade bitcoins for U.S. dollars and other currencies. Consumer interest in bitcoin grew when online retailer Overstock.com Inc announced in January that it would accept the currency for purchases. Borg, who became head of the Alabama Securities Commission in 1994, is known for organizing coalitions of regulators from other states in high-profile enforcement cases. While Borg\'s alert may help to promote consumer awareness about the risks of trading on bitcoin exchanges, regulating the marketplace is still far off, he said. Federal agencies will have to step in because the exchanges are international, Borg said. Some states such as Alabama, however, can regulate bitcoin exchanges as money transmitters, a type of business that transfers money between businesses and individuals, Borg said. Any approach would require new regulations, Borg said. "Because it\'s in the virtual world, it\'s not something you can put your hands on." Borg\'s upcoming alert was reported earlier on Monday by MarketWatch.

Getting a full, fair view of the money behind the Democrats\'\nprime enemies: Their company makes everything from Dixie Cups to Brawny\npaper towels to Lycra swimwear to a huge share of the plywood,\nlumber and other products used in construction. It operates\n4,000 miles of energy pipelines, according to its website, and\nan array of oil refineries that can process 670,000 barrels of\noil a day. Other subsidiaries are leading producers of chemicals,\nfertilizer and electronic and fiber optic systems. Still another\nunit trades energy products such as crude oil and natural gas.\nApparently (the website is vague) it even has a business buying\nand selling the emission allowances related to pollution control\nefforts throughout the industrialized world. The website takes pains to note the company\'s stunning\neconomic success - its value has grown "more than 3,500 fold\nsince 1960" - "has supported education and social progress.\nThese philanthropic efforts include support for educational\ninstitutions, foundations and programs that study and promote\nmarket-based solutions to societal problems. [The company] also\nworks to protect, conserve and enhance natural resources. \ncompanies around the world have earned nearly 800 awards for\nsafety, environmental excellence, community stewardship,\ninnovation and customer service." In fact, there\'s a separate section on the website detailing\nthe company\'s multiple environmental protection efforts and\nawards. What company is this that\'s supporting all these seemingly\ngood works with its profits? It\'s Koch Industries, controlled by\nCharles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who are funding\nhundreds of millions of dollars\' worth of ads attacking\nDemocrats this year - mostly aimed at putting conservative\nRepublicans in control of the Senate. An article in the Washington Post last week tried to link\nthe Koch brothers\' support for the Keystone energy pipeline to\ntheir company\'s economic interests. But it was so lame - none of\ntheir products is due to go through the pipeline - that it made\nme want to read a complete article, full of unbiased reporting\nacross the range of their business interests. I want to know\njust how self-interested the brothers\' political spending spree\nactually is. Sure, any political activism by rich people to limit taxes\nand government regulation is bound to be in their interests\ngenerally. But do the Koch brothers have a more specific agenda,\nas the Post article tried to prove? Or could it be that Charles\nand David Koch just happen to believe a conservative government\nis good for their country? The brothers and their foundation have also given hundreds\nof millions to multiple charities that have nothing to do with\npolitics. As an article in the Indianapolis Star points out, the\nCharles Koch Foundation "underwrites research and teaching at\nBrown, Mount Holyoke, Sarah Lawrence, University of Wisconsin at\nMadison, Vassar and some 245 other colleges." The New York State\nTheater at Lincoln Center has been renamed the David H. Koch\nTheater because he\'s such a generous benefactor. These are not beneficiaries associated with hard right\ncauses. As the Star also notes, "Koch Industries (which offers\nsame-sex spousal benefits to its legally married employees) also\ndonated $814,000 to the Kansas State University Office of\nDiversity to assist \'historically under-represented students.\'" Is this all part of a plot to camouflage the brothers\'\nmaster plan? Or could it be that their outsized effort to buy\nresults at the ballot box is, to them, no different from their\noutsized gifts to Lincoln Center or cancer care or anything else\nthey think is good for the world? Much of the media and punditry seems to have entertained\nthat more generous view when another billionaire, Tom Steyer,\ndecided to give millions to anyone willing to block the Keystone\npipeline. But the Koch brothers have not enjoyed that benefit of\nthe doubt. For a few individuals on either side to try to dominate the\nagenda this way in a supposed democracy raises its own\nfundamental questions - and arguably shows a cavalier disregard\nfor democracy itself. But the opposition to the Koch brothers\nhas pushed beyond that, to accusations, in Senate Majority\nLeader Harry Reid\'s words, that they are "un-American" and are\n"trying to buy America \x7f to benefit themselves." As a private company, not much is known about Koch\nIndustries, although its website says it has 60,000 employees\nand annual revenues of "about $115 billion" - which would make\nit 16th or 17th on the Fortune 500 list of public companies,\njust ahead of IBM or JPMorgan Chase. A full-bore look inside the conglomerate would produce all\nkinds of interesting angles before we even get to the question\nof whether the brothers\' political spending is a wholly\nself-interested investment by people who care only about\nthemselves. To take one narrow example, what kind of health\ninsurance do employees get at the company owned by the brothers\nwho have financed tens of millions of dollars of attack ads on\nObamacare, using fictitious accounts of people victimized by the\nlaw? But the larger question, answered only by a complete look at\ntheir businesses and the link between them and the political\ncauses they are funding, is whether the Koch money firehouse is,\nat its core, their version of an investment in a better planet\nor, as opponents like Reid charge, a better profit and loss\nstatement.\n\n2. Someone please explain bitcoin: Okay, I admit it. Although I consider myself a fairly\nsophisticated businessperson and reporter, and although I have\nread a ton about bitcoins, I have no understanding of what they\nare, how they work or are supposed to work. Please, don\'t tell me it\'s "virtual money," or some such\nthing. Tell me exactly how a bitcoin system is supposed to\noperate. What is virtual money? Yes, I know that the dollars in\nmy pocket are virtual money - because they\'re just pieces of\npaper. But I also know that they\'re universally recognized and\nguaranteed by a signature from the Treasury secretary to be\n"legal tender." Who is supposed to be standing behind bitcoin and why would\nanyone believe it\'s worth anything? A New York Times story last Saturday about the "miraculous\ndiscover of about $116 million in missing Bitcoin" got me\nfrustrated all over again. Here\'s the key sentence: "In a posting on its website in both Japanese and English,\nthe now-defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox announced that it had\nfound the coins in an \'old-format wallets,\' the virtual currency\nequivalent of finding money in another pair of pants." Do you know what the means? Or do you just think you should\nbecause it\'s in the Times? It\'s time for a sophisticated journalist who can write and\nspeak jargon-less English - like Floyd Norris of the Times, or\nJim Cramer of CNBC, or maybe even Michael Lewis - to help us.\n\n (Steven Brill)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0MM1O220140325', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 25, 15, 10), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'COLUMN-A fair view of the Koch brothers, and explaining bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u' * Lawsky: Mt. Gox collapse is part of a "shaking out" * Japan FinMin: not yet clear if crime or just bankruptcy * New York State hoping to attract bitcoin operators By Douwe Miedema and Tetsushi Kajimoto WASHINGTON/TOKYO, March 4 The collapse of the\nMt. Gox bitcoin exchange could ultimately strengthen the virtual\ncurrency industry by weeding out weaker operators and prompting\nmore supervision, New York\'s banking regulator said on Monday. Japan\'s government, however, said it was still trying to\nfigure out how the Tokyo-based company, once the world\'s biggest\nbitcoin exchange, could lose nearly half a billion dollars worth\nof the virtual currency in a short period, and whether crime was\ninvolved. "We still have not had a clear grasp of the situation,"\nFinance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday after a cabinet\nmeeting. "(We) don\'t know if it was a crime or just a\nbankruptcy." Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Friday,\nsaying it may have lost some 850,000 bitcoins due to hacking\ninto its faulty computer system. The collapse was another setback for the virtual currency,\nwhich started circulating in 2009 and is accepted by some online\nretailers. Yet many believe the electronic currency will\nsurvive. Its proponents like the fact that its value relies on a\nnetwork of computers and is not tied to any government or\ncentral bank. Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\'s Department of\nFinancial Services, told Reuters that Mt. Gox\'s collapse was\npart of a "shaking out". "It\'s on the one hand a setback, on the other hand it will\ncause further improvements in this industry and some more\nregulatory involvement," he told Reuters on the sidelines of a\nbanking conference in the nation\'s capital. Lawsky wants to attract healthy bitcoin operators to the\nstate, and has floated the idea of launching a "BitLicense" to\nregulate operators, and to align any new rules with existing\nfinancial regulation. The agency hoped to have more to say this week about how it\nwas writing the new rules and considering how to allow bitcoin\nbusiness in the state, Lawsky said. He identified one bitcoin exchange the agency is talking to:\nBarry Silbert\'s SecondMarket Holdings, modelled after the New\nYork Stock Exchange. "We\'ve had several applications. I wouldn\'t say they\'re on\nhold but they\'re being worked on, on a parallel path ... to\nmoving the regs," Lawsky told reporters.

"We are looking into that," Mark Wetjen, acting chairman of\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told journalists after\ngiving a speech at an industry conference. "It\'s been initiated,\nthere\'s been an internal discussion at the staff level."

Gox chief Mark Karpeles\nand allowed alleged victims of the shuttered bitcoin exchange to\ndemand evidence of what they claim is a massive fraud. The market for the digital currency was rocked last month\nwhen Mt. Gox, once the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange, ceased\noperations, and soon after filed for bankruptcy. Mt. Gox said it\nmay have lost 750,000 bitcoins, worth hundreds of millions of\ndollars, in a hacking attack. The freeze on Karpeles\' assets, issued by Judge Gary\nFeinerman in Chicago, also applies to Mt. Gox\'s U.S. affiliate\nand the Japanese parent company, Tibanne, according to\nChristopher Dore, an Edelson attorney who represents U.S.\ncustomers of the bitcoin exchange. The judge\'s order did not apply to the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox\nKK, which was shielded from litigation after it filed for\nbankruptcy protection in Japan and the United States. Mt. Gox suspended withdrawals on Feb. 7, leaving customers\nunable to recover their funds. In a bankruptcy hearing on Monday, parties suing Mt. Gox\nsaid there are growing concerns that Karpeles moved millions of\ndollars of bitcoins in recent days based on information gleaned\nfrom the Internet. Dore represents Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, who\nbrought a proposed class action over what he claims is a massive\nfraud. Mt. Gox blamed the loss of hundreds of millions of\ndollars in bitcoins on a flaw in the software algorithm that\nunderlies the digital currency. "The main thing we hope to achieve is to finally see what\nthe web of things that Karpeles has put together over the last\nfew years and to start unwinding it as to where things are and\nwhat happened," said Dore. Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network\nindependent of central control. Its value soared last year, and\nthe total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion. Investors were warned on Tuesday that the lure of a quick\nprofit trading the volatile currency should not blind them to\nbitcoin\'s risk of theft, fraud and significant losses, according\nto an alert by the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority. Dore said the judge\'s order freezing Karpeles\' assets will\nexpire in 14 days, when the parties return to court to decide if\nit should be extended. John Murphy, a Baker McKenzie attorney for Mt. Gox KK, the\nbankrupt company, declined to comment. Dore said the U.S.\naffiliate, Karpeles and Tibanne were not represented at the\nhearing. The case is Gregory Greene v Mt.

Creandum said the database contained more than 300 companies trading Bitcoins - ranging from exchanges to payment processors and gambling companies - and was intended to give entrepreneurs and investors an overview of companies with a significant role in the Bitcoin system. Bitcoin is essentially software code that defines units of value, which users can move back and forth among themselves. Unlike other virtual money transmitters, its value isn\'t pegged to a hard currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro - it is determined by the demand for Bitcoins. Since its launch in January 2009, the system has grown popular with people who lack confidence in the traditional banking system, though it has also aroused concerns it could be used for money laundering. Creandum, which has invested in fast-growing Nordic tech firms such as online music streaming service Spotify and payment solutions firm iZettle, said it hoped to encourage Bitcoin enthusiasts to participate in the development of the currency. "This year and next year the Bitcoin needs to prove itself as a payment mechanism, and it could go either way," Creandum associate Joel Eriksson Enquist told Reuters. "Our hope is that the database will work like Wikipedia, with more and more contributors and more comprehensive data," he said of the open-source site which can be found at bitcoin.knackhq.com/btcdb . BUBBLE, OR A NEW WORLD? Creandum has not invested in any Bitcoin-related companies but is looking at a couple of players and Enquist himself is holding onto 10 Bitcoins he bought last year for a little over $100 each - just for the fun of it. The Bitcoin has recently traded above $1,000, up from $10 at the start of last year and fuelling concerns of a bubble. Creandum said it may take another three years before it is clear whether Bitcoin is a bubble, or whether this is "the beginning of a new world". In December, the digital currency was dealt a blow when the People\'s Bank of China banned financial institutions, though not individuals, from trading in Bitcoins. U.S. prosecutors are also sitting on millions of dollars worth of the currency which had belonged to Silk Road, an online market that authorities say was a conduit for purchasing drugs and computer hacking services. Creandum\'s database lists 46 Bitcoin exchanges in North America, 24 in Europe and 21 in Asia. BTC China and Europe\'s btc-e and Bitstamp are the biggest exchanges, with the three seeing 2.5 million Bitcoins traded on their platforms in the 30 days to January 9. While there are about 100 virtual currencies, with new ones appearing every week, Bitcoin is by far the best known. E-commerce site Overstock.com recently announced its plan to become the first major U.S. retailer to accept the digital currency. Dating site OKCupid also allows Bitcoins as a form of payment.

"It gets used regularly based on where we are located," he\nsaid. "There are lots of technology-orientated consumers within\nour area, and it caters very easily for them," he said. "Currently people are buying coffees and beers with\nbitcoins, mostly beers actually," Letchford added. He sees a mainstream future for the virtual currency, even\nthough the top bitcoin exchange has collapsed and the currency\nhas been volatile due to speculation as well as prone to\ncriminal activities. At the beginning of March, the Tokyo-based company Mt. Gox,\nonce the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, declared bankruptcy\nsaying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion\ndollars due to hacker attacks. In 2012, a leaked FBI report said the virtual currency was\nan "increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities\nbeyond the cyber realm". Bitcoin, which has been growing in popularity, relies on a\nnetwork of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as\npart of a process that verifies and permanently records the\ndetails of every bitcoin transaction.  The currency came into existence in 2009, with the value\nnegotiated by individuals chatting on bitcoin forums.

Customers who use the machine in East London are charged an\n8 percent commission, and each customer is limited to 1,000\npounds ($1,700) in transactions per month.

Bitcoin hit a high of $1,073 on Tokyo-based exchange Mt.\nGox, the best-known operator of a bitcoin digital marketplace,\ncompared with just below $900 the previous day. At the beginning of the month, bitcoin, a prominent digital\ncurrency that is not backed by a government or central bank,\ntraded at around $215. The spike in its price has some believing\nthat it has become overvalued in a short period of time, owing\nto its limited supply and increasing demand. "A narrow asset class and lots of liquidity is the perfect\nenvironment for a rapid burst up in value, and then\ncorrections," said Sebastien Galy, a currency strategist at\nSociete Generale in New York. Bitcoin trades 24 hours a day, every day. The supply of the\ncurrency, which is "mined" by solving math problems, is limited,\nand recently stood at 12 million bitcoins, worth about $12.9\nbillion at recent prices. Bitcoin is not backed by physical assets and is not run by\nany person or group. Its value depends on people\'s confidence in\nthe currency. It has been gaining acceptance by the general\npublic and investment community but has yet to become an\naccepted form of payment on the websites of major retailers such\nas Amazon.com. Earlier in the month, the U.S. Senate held a hearing on\nvirtual currencies, with some officials expressing concern that\nit is notable for its use in criminal activity and that there is\na lack of regulatory oversight. But bitcoin advocates say last week\'s Senate hearing gave\nmore legitimacy to the currency, in part fueling the gains. "It isn\'t just the bitcoin community saying that bitcoin is\nused for good things and there\'s a lot of great potential. We\nhave members of Congress and government agencies who all agree,"\nsaid Jinyoung Lee Englund, spokeswoman for the Bitcoin\nFoundation in Washington. (Edward Hadas: Bitcoin a step back not forward\n ) Bitcoin is valued by many users for its anonymity. But\ngovernment officials expressed concerns that many virtual\ncurrency services do not have the proper controls in place to\nprevent illegal activities such as money laundering. "Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably Bitcoin, have\ncaptured the imagination of some, struck fear among others and\nconfused the heck out of the rest of us," Senator Thomas Carper\ntold the Senate Homeland Security Committee earlier this month. In October, federal authorities shut down an online\nmarketplace called Silk Road that was used for purchasing drugs\nand hiring hit men. Authorities seized $3.6 million worth of\nbitcoin, which was used instead of cash or credit cards to\ncomplete transactions on Silk Road.

Gox, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, which\ncollapsed last month after losing nearly half a billion dollars\nworth of customers\' digital currency. Lawsuits in the United States and Canada represent a new\nlegal front - and a deep-pocketed defendant - in the battle over\nMt. Gox, which claims hackers stole huge amounts of its own and\nits customers\' assets. Mizuho, the core unit of Mizuho Financial Group Inc\n, Japan\'s second-biggest "megabank" by assets, was added\nas a defendant on Friday to an existing U.S. lawsuit against Mt.\nGox for allegedly aiding in a fraud by providing banking\nservices to the exchange. Also on Friday, Mizuho was named in a class-action lawsuit\nin Canada against Mt. Gox, alleging a lengthy security breach at\nMt. Gox resulted in "the pilfering of millions of dollars\' worth\nof its users\' bitcoins." A Mizuho spokeswoman in Tokyo declined comment on Sunday on\nthe lawsuits, filed in Chicago federal court and the Ontario\nSuperior Court of Justice. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox closed its virtual doors on February 25\nand three days later filed for Chapter 11-style bankruptcy\nprotection with a Japanese court.  CUSTOMERS SUSPECT FRAUD The company said it had likely lost all 750,000 customer\nbitcoins it was holding, as well as 100,000 of its own and 2.8\nbillion yen in cash. That represents $567 million of vanished\nassets at current market prices, as well as about 7 percent of\nthe bitcoins in circulation. Mt. Gox blames systematic attacks on what it acknowledges\nwas lax computer security. Customers - more than 99 percent of\nwhom are non-Japanese - suspect a massive fraud. On Monday, Mt. Gox filed for a U.S. Chapter 15 bankruptcy,\nwhich shields the company from lawsuits in U.S. courts as the\nTokyo case proceeds. Mizuho held non-bitcoin currency on behalf of Tokyo-based\nMt. Gox and its customers, according to the amended U.S.\ncomplaint by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident who has said\nhe lost $25,000 when Mt. Gox shut down. The U.S. suit accuses Mizuho of knowing of Mt. Gox\'s fraud,\nof not segregating funds that belong to Mt. Gox from those of\nits customers and of continuing to provide banking services that\ninflated losses for bitcoin customers. "Mizuho profited from the fraud," said the complaint. The Canadian plaintiffs allege that "all non-bitcoin\ncurrency received by the Mt. Gox defendants from its users was\nheld in an account or accounts" at Mizuho. MIZUHO VS MT GOX In fact, the bank by January was trying to close the\nexchange\'s account. An unnamed Mizuho manager at Mizuho bank, in a recording\nleaked on the internet, asks Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox\'s\n28-year-old French CEO, to close his firm\'s account with the\nbank, citing compliance issues and moves by other banks to cut\nties with the exchange. The recording was confirmed as authentic by a person\nfamiliar with the situation. If Mizuho had to close the account forcibly, the manager\nwarned, it could damage Mt. Gox\'s business. "There would be confusion when your regular users try to\ndeposit money. We don\'t think that\'s right," he says. "If\nthere\'s confusion, we\'d come under criticism and you\'d be in\ntrouble as well." Karpeles told the Mizuho official Mt. Gox was unwilling to\ncooperate. The Canadian suit was filed on behalf of "all persons in\nCanada who paid a fee to Mt. Gox to buy, sell or otherwise trade\nbitcoins" and all those who had bitcoins or currency stored with\nMt. Gox on Feb. 7. While the U.S. bankruptcy stopped American courts from\nissuing orders against the Tokyo company, it does not protect\nKarpeles, the parent company Tibanne or Mt. Gox\'s U.S.\naffiliate. On Tuesday, the U.S. assets of those three were\ntemporarily frozen by the federal judge overseeing Greene\'s\nlawsuit. The amended U.S. complaint said that despite the asset\nfreeze, "evidence suggests" defendants continue to receive\nbitcoins in the United States. The amended complaint also added as defendants two\nexecutives of Mt. Gox, Jed McCaleb and Gonzague Gay-Bouchery. A Baker & McKenzie attorney who represented Mt.

Gox bitcoin exchange could ultimately strengthen the virtual currency industry by weeding out weaker operators and prompting more supervision, New York\'s banking regulator said on Monday. Japan\'s government, however, said it was still trying to figure out how the Tokyo-based company, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, could lose nearly half a billion dollars worth of the virtual currency in a short period, and whether crime was involved. "We still have not had a clear grasp of the situation," Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday after a cabinet meeting. "(We) don\'t know if it was a crime or just a bankruptcy." Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Friday, saying it may have lost some 850,000 bitcoins due to hacking into its faulty computer system. The collapse was another setback for the virtual currency, which started circulating in 2009 and is accepted by some online retailers. Yet many believe the electronic currency will survive. Its proponents like the fact that its value relies on a network of computers and is not tied to any government or central bank. Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\'s Department of Financial Services, told Reuters that Mt. Gox\'s collapse was part of a "shaking out". "It\'s on the one hand a setback, on the other hand it will cause further improvements in this industry and some more regulatory involvement," he told Reuters on the sidelines of a banking conference in the nation\'s capital.

Texas Securities Commissioner John Morgan entered an\nemergency order on Monday against tiny Balanced Energy LLC,\nwhich claimed it was the first energy company to accept the\nvirtual currency, according to the regulator. "The price of digital currency is subject to extreme swings,\nwhich could affect the amount of money available for business\noperations," the regulator said in a statement. Bitcoin is a digital currency that, unlike conventional\nmoney, is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network that lacks\ncentral control. Its value has soared in the last year, and the\ntotal worth of bit coins minted is now about $7 billion. Balanced Energy, based in the Dallas area, has drilled 33\nwells on 10,500 acres in central Texas.

Bitcoin is not backed by physical assets, is not run by any\nperson or group, and its value depends on people\'s confidence in\nthe currency. The dollar price of Bitcoins has spiked over the\npast year as more people became aware of the currency and\nspeculators jumped into the market, which remains highly\nvolatile. Bitcoin recently broke $200, compared to $12 a year\nago. The goal of Bitcoin miners is to pull in more than what they\nspend on their rigs - some cost over $20,000 - and the\nelectricity they need to keep the machines running 24 hours a\nday. That is no easy feat. In the past three months, miners added\nso much gear with drastically improved chips that processing\npower on the network jumped from 289 terahashes per second to\nmore than 4,000 terahashes per second, according to The Genesis\nBlock, a blog that collects Bitcoin data.

While that is peanuts for large\nsemiconductor companies like Intel Corp and Qualcomm\nInc, it is a lucrative market for a handful of small\ndevelopers. About 11.9 million Bitcoins, worth $2.4 billion at recent\nprices, have been minted since the currency began circulating.\nBased on recent activity, the network is on track to create\naround 1.4 million new Bitcoins annually over the next three\nyears, the equivalent of more than $280 million a year at recent\nexchange rates.

HOBBY STATE Mining with a simple laptop PC was easy back in 2009, when\nthe fledgling Bitcoin network was a fraction of its current\nsize. But within a year, hobbyists found that graphics chips,\noften referred to as GPUs and widely used by PC gamers, could\nprovide a major boost in mining output. Miners cobbled together dozens of graphics chips in their\ngarages and basements, surrounded by fans to keep the\nelectronics from overheating. Then in 2010, entrepreneurs caught wind. Jeff Ownby and a\nhandful of colleagues had just formed Butterfly Labs with the\ngoal of using off-the-shelf programmable chips, known as FPGAs,\nto help banks run complex financial risk simulations. "As we were starting down the road planning this, we read\nabout Bitcoin and said \'Wow, this is exactly what we\'re trying\nto do here,\'" Ownby said. "It was pretty much in a hobby state,\nso we thought this might be something." Butterfly Labs and other startups optimized FPGAs, which are\nmore typically used in factories and telecommunications gear, to\nwork efficiently on the Bitcoin network. In 2012, the Bitcoin arms race escalated again when\nButterfly Labs and rivals, all with little or no semiconductor\nengineering experience, started designing chips from the ground\nup. Custom chips, known as application specific integrated\ncircuits (ASICs), are normally made by companies focused on\nhigh-volume products like televisions - not startups making\nsmall batches of digital mining devices. "They\'re the Wild West," said John Cheng, head of California\nbased-Custom Silicon Solutions, which helped Butterfly Labs\ndesign and manufacture its ASIC. "There\'s a certain rhythm\nyou\'re used to in the chip business. It\'s usually two or three\nyears before your ramp, but these guys wanted to ramp in six\nmonths." Butterfly Labs said on Thursday it recently took a\ndownpayment for new mining gear in Bitcoins equivalent to $1\nmillion, the largest-ever transaction in the digital currency.\nIt identified the customer as HashTrade, a company selling\ncontracts for cloud-based Bitcoin mining run in data centers.

Bitcoin hit a high of $1,073 on Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, the best-known operator of a bitcoin digital marketplace, compared with just below $900 the previous day. At the beginning of the month, bitcoin, a prominent digital currency that is not backed by a government or central bank, traded at around $215. The spike in its price has some believing that it has become overvalued in a short period of time, owing to its limited supply and increasing demand. "A narrow asset class and lots of liquidity is the perfect environment for a rapid burst up in value, and then corrections," said Sebastien Galy, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York. Bitcoin trades 24 hours a day, every day. The supply of the currency, which is "mined" by solving math problems, is limited, and recently stood at 12 million bitcoins, worth about $12.9 billion at recent prices. Bitcoin is not backed by physical assets and is not run by any person or group. Its value depends on people\'s confidence in the currency. It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and investment community but has yet to become an accepted form of payment on the websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com. Earlier in the month, the U.S. Senate held a hearing on virtual currencies, with some officials expressing concern that it is notable for its use in criminal activity and that there is a lack of regulatory oversight. But bitcoin advocates say last week\'s Senate hearing gave more legitimacy to the currency, in part fueling the gains. "It isn\'t just the bitcoin community saying that bitcoin is used for good things and there\'s a lot of great potential. We have members of Congress and government agencies who all agree," said Jinyoung Lee Englund, spokeswoman for the Bitcoin Foundation in Washington. Bitcoin is valued by many users for its anonymity. But government officials expressed concerns that many virtual currency services do not have the proper controls in place to prevent illegal activities such as money laundering. "Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably Bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others and confused the heck out of the rest of us," Senator Thomas Carper told the Senate Homeland Security Committee earlier this month. In October, federal authorities shut down an online marketplace called Silk Road that was used for purchasing drugs and hiring hit men. Authorities seized $3.6 million worth of bitcoin, which was used instead of cash or credit cards to complete transactions on Silk Road. More than 200 bitcoin businesses and other merchants are participating in a bitcoin Black Friday shopping event, where users can buy everything from airplane tickets to Christmas trees to organic beer.

Gox, which shuttered on Tuesday with little explanation? Probably not much. Customers of the bitcoin exchange may have little chance of recovering their funds if they prove to be missing, legal and regulatory experts said. Clients could file lawsuits, claiming negligence or breach of contract, but the virtual currency is subject to very little regulatory oversight and no government guarantees. Japan-based Mt. Gox went dark on Tuesday, weeks after a spate of cyber attacks, leaving customers unable to access their accounts and underscoring the risks associated with bitcoins. Bitcoins, which exist in electronic form, depend on a network of computers to solve complex mathematical problems in order to verify and record every transaction. Investors deposit their bitcoins in digital "wallets" at various exchanges; Mt. Gox had been the largest as recently as February 7, when it and other exchanges were forced to halt withdrawals following several cyber attacks. Unlike bank accounts in the United States, bitcoin deposits have no government-backed insurance. Instead, customers would have the same avenues of legal redress as anyone who entrusted property to an institution that failed to keep it protected, such as negligence, breach of contract or even fraud, said James Grimmelmann, a professor at the University of Maryland who focuses on Internet law. "To me, the first really important conceptual hurdle to get over is that these things really are property," he said. "When you take money from the public and store it somewhere you claim is secure, you put property law in play." If Mt. Gox has no assets, however, individual claims would fail to recover any funds, said Daniel Friedberg, a lawyer with Riddell Williams in Seattle who specializes in financial regulatory matters. "The practical reality is, even if you do get a judgment against Mt. Gox, do they have the ability to pay?" Friedberg said. A document circulating online that purports to be a crisis plan for Mt. Gox indicated that the exchange had $174 million in liabilities against $32.75 million in assets, though its veracity could not be confirmed. The Tokyo-based Mt. Gox could also file for bankruptcy in Japan, leaving it up to a court to distribute any remaining assets to its creditors. REGULATION COMING? Several regulatory and legal experts said they expected the Mt. Gox shutdown could spur regulators to take more immediate steps to protect future customers. Jeffrey Matsuura, a lawyer at Alliance Law Group in Virginia who specializes in online commerce issues, said he wouldn\'t be surprised if state or federal consumer protection agencies eventually take some kind of action regarding Mt. Gox and other exchanges. But Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said people who deposited bitcoins with Mt. Gox knew that the exchange had experienced problems in recent months. "At this point, bitcoin is speculative," he said. "People are going in with eyes wide open." Thus far, the only U.S. regulatory agency with specific oversight of Mt. Gox is the U.S. Treasury Department\'s anti-money laundering unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, after the exchange agreed to register as a money services business last summer. New York State\'s top banking regulator is exploring licensing requirements for bitcoin exchanges, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has considered whether to set rules for the virtual currency. And federal prosecutors in New York have issued subpoenas to Mt. Gox and other exchanges seeking information on how they had handled recent cyber attacks, a source told Reuters. "Bitcoin in many ways is terra incognita for the regulatory system," said Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford University and a former SEC commissioner. But, he added, that would not stop federal prosecutors in Manhattan from investigating criminal activity involving bitcoins if any of the transactions had a connection to New York. "The lack of clarity about formal regulatory status provides no safe harbor for liability for criminal fraud," he said.

The move comes as Alibaba, China\'s biggest e-commerce company, seeks the smoothest of rides toward a giant initial public offering of stock expected later this year. In a statement posted on its website late on Tuesday, Taobao said the ban is effective from January 14. Taobao\'s move to fall in line with the government\'s wishes also comes as Alibaba presses on with efforts to stamp out the sale of fake goods on the online marketplace ahead of the IPO. Alibaba has been conservatively estimated to be worth over $100 billion. "The central bank clearly has required third-party payment services to close bitcoin...trading channels," Taobao said in its statement, without disclosing any details on bitcoin sales through its platform up to now. Backed by neither a government nor a bank, bitcoin has attracted currency speculators in recent months. Alibaba spokeswoman Florence Shih said, "In the interest of consumer protection, Taobao has banned the sale of bitcoins on the platform." Taobao uses Alibaba\'s online payment affiliate Alipay to process transactions across the world\'s second-biggest economy, handling over 1 trillion yuan ($165 billion) in annual sales volume together with its sister shopping portal T-Mall. The Taobao ban, which covers other virtual currencies, also includes the sale of any guides, computer hardware or software related to bitcoin "mining". In the mining process users can mint new bitcoins of their own by having a computer solve complex mathematical problems. Most bitcoin sales take place on specialized electronic platforms, rather than online marketplaces like Taobao, that are designed to trade the virtual currency for various physical currencies. In December, the People\'s Bank of China (PBOC) banned financial institutions from trading in bitcoins, saying the government would act to prevent money laundering risks from bitcoin, which is not backed by a government or central bank. It did not ban individual trading. Later the same month, the Chinese Business News reported that the government had asked third-party payment services to stop handling bitcoin transactions, forcing Shanghai-based BTC China, the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange platform by volume, to stop taking Chinese yuan deposits. "I think it\'s overreaching," said Bobby Lee, Chief Executive Officer of BTC China, referring to Taobao\'s ban on bitcoin-related accessories. "I think they\'re trying to just win favors from the government." The PBOC stance reflects the fact that the bitcoin trade represents a potential hole in the country\'s capital controls. They are minted anonymously, untraceable, and can be carried on memory sticks or transmitted electronically. However, analysts say that given the total value of bitcoins in circulation remains tiny relative to other currencies, the trade is unlikely to have much impact on the wider economy for now. The price of bitcoins on BTC China fell 15 percent on Tuesday to 4718.51 yuan, but had bounced back 4.5 percent by late afternoon on Wednesday.

Bitcoin is not backed by any central bank or government, or\nby physical assets. Their value depends on people\'s confidence\nin the currency. It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and\ninvestment community but have yet to become an accepted form of\npayment on websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com\n. The Bank of France said the price of bitcoin in legal\ncurrencies was inherently volatile and users may find it\ndifficult to convert to real money. The anonymity that bitcoin offer users also raises the risk\nthat they could also be used for money-laundering and financing\nof terrorism, the central bank said in a publication. "Even if bitcoin is not currently a credible investment\nvehicle and therefore do not pose a significant risk to\nfinancial stability, they represent a financial risk for those\nwho hold them," the Bank of France said. Though the central bank saw no threat to its monopoly on the\nissuance of legal tender, bitcoin\'s growing popularity has\nincreasingly attracted the attention of authorities in several\ncountries, including China and the United States.  The Chinese central bank warned financial institutions on\nThursday against trading bitcoin, which has proven particularly\npopular in China. The price of the digital currency rose over $1,000 last\nmonth for the first time, extending a 400 percent surge in less\nthan a month and fuelling concerns of a bubble in the making. The Bank of France warned that speculating on the price of\nbitcoin could become costly if other users became unwilling to\nconvert gains into legal tender, potentially putting the whole\nsystem at risk of collapse if bitcoin demand evaporated. Noting a growing number of retailers and service providers\nwho accept bitcoin for payment in France, the central bank\nwarned they benefited from no guarantee that the bitcoin could\nbe cashed for real money.\n\n (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Pravin Char)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0JK2M920131205', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 5, 7, 40), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'French central bank warns over bitcoin risks'}, {'articleText': u' NEW YORK Nov 18 Bitcoin surged over 27 percent\nto a new high of US$675 on Monday ahead of a U.S. government\nhearing on possible regulation of the digital currency. While not an official seal of approval, the hearing is\ngiving some legitimacy to a payment mechanism that has been \nassociated with illegal activities even as it gains acceptance\nby the general public and investment community. Witnesses at the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing\ninclude officials from the Secret Service and Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network and the Justice Department\'s Criminal\nDivision. "The government is taking a very thoughtful and balanced\napproach to bitcoin and bitcoin regulation," said Barry Silbert,\nfounder of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, launched in late\nSeptember and valued at US$22.8 million on Friday. It holds\naround 53,000 Bitcoins. Bitcoin traded as high as US$675 on Monday on Tokyo-based\nexchange Mt. Gox, the best-known operator of a bitcoin digital\nmarketplace. That was a rise of 27.7 percent from Sunday\'s\nclose. It last changed hands at US$672. The digital currency, which trades 24 hours a day, every\nday, has risen around 404 percent in the last two months. Association with drugs, money laundering, murder for hire \nand other illegal activities has not stymied interest in\nbitcoin, the digital currency not backed by any government or\ncentral bank and until recently a niche alternative currency\ntouted by computer geeks and anti-government advocates. The currency, whose supply is limited, is "mined" by solving\nmath problems. Bitcoin transactions are tracked by a network of\ncomputers that validate transactions and prevent counterfeit. In October, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation shut\ndown Silk Road, an online marketplace used to buy and sell\nillegal drugs, and seized $3.6 million in bitcoins. "Lawmakers are rightfully concerned about the illegal\naspects of bitcoin but the fact that they\'re giving bitcoin the\ntime of day helps cement its legitimacy," said Christopher\nVecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX. But it may also be government interest itself that is\nprompting the currency\'s huge moves of recent weeks, he said. "If investors feel that bitcoin is truly legitimate but\nforesee supply constraints due to exchanges closing or new\nregulations hitting the market, there is a sense of urgency\ndeveloping to obtain bitcoins now, \'while you can,\'" said\nVecchio. Irrespective of the reason for the move, Bitcoin Investment\nTrust\'s Silbert at least is optimistic about the long-term\noutlook for the digital currency. "Everyone is uncomfortable that the price has moved so\nquickly," Silbert said. "Bitcoin in its short history has gone\nthrough a series of bubbles and busts. But after every bust a\nnew price base has formed." Shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust had a net asset value\nof $42.44 on Friday, up from $12.88 when the fund launched on\nSeptember 25.

Gox, once the world\'s largest bitcoin\nexchange, has been sued by a customer in what may be the first\nof many U.S. lawsuits seeking to recoup millions of dollars of\nlosses linked to a hacking attack that led to the exchange\'s\nbankruptcy. In a complaint filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in\nChicago, plaintiff Gregory Greene said Mt. Gox and its chief\nexecutive, Mark Karpeles, were negligent and committed fraud for\nhaving failed to protect the Tokyo-based exchange from theft. Greene said bitcoin prices plummeted after Mt. Gox found the\nsecurity breach, but said he and other investors in the virtual\ncurrency could not cut their losses because the exchange had\nhalted trading. Mt. Gox took down its website on Tuesday. "Mt. Gox intentionally and knowingly failed to provide its\nusers with the level of security protection for which they\npaid," said Greene, who estimated his bitcoin stake at $25,000. The lawsuit seeks class action status on behalf of Mt. Gox\nusers, restitution, monetary damages and other remedies. It was not immediately clear which law firm would defend Mt.\nGox against the lawsuit. Baker & McKenzie, a Chicago-based firm\nthat represents the exchange in Japan, did not immediately\nrespond on Friday to requests for comment. At a news conference on Friday at the Tokyo District Court,\nKarpeles said he was "very sorry" and blamed Mt. Gox\'s collapse\non a "weakness in our system," but predicted that the bitcoin\nmarket would continue to grow. Mt. Gox said it may have 750,000 of its customers\' bitcoins\nand 100,000 of its own, equal to about 7 percent of bitcoins\nworldwide, for a total loss of about $480 million. The exchange reported having 127,000 creditors, liabilities\nof 6.5 billion yen ($64 million) and assets of 3.84 billion yen\n($38 million). It is common for alleged frauds that generate significant\nlosses or attention to result in a slew of U.S. lawsuits seeking\nclass action status, even if the alleged wrongful activity\noccurs outside the country. "This is a case of serial mismanagement, if not outright\nfraud, by Karpeles and Mt. Gox," said Steven Woodrow, a partner\nat the Edelson law firm in Denver, who filed Greene\'s lawsuit.\n"Users of the exchange are collectively out millions while Mt.\nGox holds onto their bitcoins.

Virtual currencies are dominated by bitcoin, now well-known\nafter the failure of Mt.

"We are in the process of integrating other exchanges at the moment and will be back up and running as soon as possible," Samman, based in Sydney, Australia, told Reuters late Tuesday. Samman said he hoped to resume trading bitcoin derivatives, a sector that has shown tremendous promise, by the end of next week. He said customer deposits on BTC were safe and clients could withdraw at any time. If Mt. Gox\'s troubles do any damage, it would be short-lived, he said. BTC has some exposure in Mt. Gox because the company trades on the site. "But we are well able to take a hit if that is in case the fact." "Mt. Gox ceased being an efficient exchange a while ago and has lacked trust from the community.

Gox,\nonce the world\'s leading bitcoin exchange, was ordered to the\nUnited States to answer questions related to its U.S. bankruptcy\ncase, filed after the company lost $400 million of customers\'\ndigital currency. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Jernigan on Tuesday ordered\nKarpeles to appear on April 17 in Dallas at the offices of Baker\n& McKenzie, the law firm that represents Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox customers want its chief executive and majority\nowner, Mark Karpeles, to explain why the exchange shut down in\nFebruary and what happened to their 750,000 bitcoins, which the\ncompany said were stolen in a computer hacking attack. Customers have alleged that insiders including Karpeles may\nhave stolen the money, and employees told Reuters they were\nworried as early as 2012 that customers\' money was being\ndiverted for operating expenses. Mt. Gox filed bankruptcy in February in Tokyo. Last month,\nKarpeles asked a Dallas court to grant Mt. Gox Chapter 15\nbankruptcy protection, in part to put a stop to a class action\nthat had been filed by U.S. customers in Chicago federal court. Under Chapter 15, protection from creditors is not\nautomatic. Mt. Gox must prove at a May 20 hearing that it should\nbe granted such protection. "If he avails himself of this court, my God, he is going to\nget himself over here," Jernigan said at the Bankruptcy Court\nhearing in Dallas at which she ordered Karpeles to appear. John Mitchell, a Baker & McKenzie attorney, said the company\nmay replace Karpeles as the "foreign representative" of Mt. Gox\nin the U.S. bankruptcy court, a suggestion that did not sit well\nwith the judge. "He filed this case," she responded curtly. Karpeles\' testimony could help solve the mystery of what\nhappened to money and bitcoins that were entrusted to Mt. Gox by\nits clients, most of them from the United States. Karpeles controlled the company\'s financial records and may\nbe the only person who knows where the company\'s assets and\nmoney might be, Steven Woodrow, an attorney for U.S. customers,\ntold the Dallas hearing. Jernigan limited the deposition questioning of Karpeles to\nissues pertaining to whether the court should grant permanent\nbankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox. The case is In Re: Mt. Gox Co.

It did not, however, curtail the use of bitcoin by individuals. "I think it\'s measured and it\'s positive," said Zennon Kapron, of the financial consultancy Kapronasia. "It does add legitimacy to the idea that it could be a nationwide accepted currency." The value of bitcoins on Chinese exchanges fell after the announcement, however, with one expert predicting the price could halve in the short-term. Digital currencies are generally highly volatile. Bitcoins have seen their value relative to the dollar skyrocket some 800 percent in the past two months as speculators have piled into the currency, according to bitcoinity.org. While there is no official data available, bitcoin market operators say Chinese nationals are major participants in the market and hold an outsized share of the total number of bitcoins in circulation. Shanghai-based BTC China has recently become the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange by volume. A statement on the website of the People\'s Bank of China (PBOC) said that the government would act to prevent money laundering risks from bitcoin, which is not backed by a government or central bank. The PBOC may have cause to be concerned about bitcoins, which are anonymous, untraceable, and can be carried on memory sticks or transmitted electronically, because they represent a potential hole in the country\'s capital controls. However, analysts point out that, given the tiny value of the total bitcoins in circulation relative to other currencies, it is unlikely to have much impact on the wider economy. EYES ON BITCOIN More cause for worry is the way these digital currencies have engendered a new wave of creative criminality focused on hacking online platforms and stealing bitcoins stored there, and their potential for use in money laundering, bribery and purchases of illicit products such as drugs and weapons. The government will require trading platforms that deal in virtual currencies such as bitcoin to register with telecommunications authorities, it said. The notice was issued jointly by the PBOC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission and China Insurance Regulatory Commission. "This is an industry that will need to be governed or regulated. The safety and the well-being of the common user has to be taken into consideration. All this is expected," said Ron Cao, Managine Director at Lightspeet Venture Partners, which recently invested $5 million in BTC China. "\'We\'ve got a long way to go. This thing needs to be regulated at some point. We\'re studying it. Don\'t jump into it.\' My read is that\'s the tone of the message." Bitcoin traders sold on the Chinese government\'s announcement. On the Chinese platform FXBTC.com, the yuan-bitcoin exchange rate dropped as much as about 20 percent after the news before rebounding slightly to around 5,800 yuan per bitcoin in heavy trading. On BTC-e, the dollar-bitcoin rate had fallen about 11 percent to about $945 from $1,063 before the news. Cao said he would not be surprised to see the value of bitcoins fall as much as 50 percent over the next week or two. Many bitcoin proponents say the currency\'s volatility will have to flatten out before it can be adopted more widely as a near-frictionless means of payment and regulation may help. More regulation was likely, although the initial ban on financial institutions may eventually be lifted, analysts said. "I would be cautious about jumping the gun and taking today\'s announcement as indicative as how the space will be regulated in the future," said Mark Natkin, of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. "Once they have a better idea of how the market works and which players are likely to emerge as the leading players, then they\'ll come out with firmer regulations, with more specific licensing requirements," and possibly minimum capital requirements for firms entering the sector, he said.

Chinese bitcoin chat rooms buzzed last month as investors\nnoticed that the digital currency as sold on China\'s biggest\nexchange was more expensive, in dollar terms, than bitcoins\ntraded abroad using dollars, creating a tempting arbitrage play. Traders could earn profits by buying bitcoins using dollars\non a foreign exchange such as Mt. Gox, reselling them for yuan\nat the higher price on BTC China, the main local exchange, and\nfinally converting the yuan back to dollars. "Insane bitcoin. If you\'ve got dollars, hurry and do\narbitrage," a user called \'foxtree\' wrote on Weibo, a\nTwitter-like micro-blogging platform, on Nov. 19, the day the\ngap peaked at more than 30 percent. A key driver of the price gap was China\'s capital controls,\nwhich make it difficult for speculators to swap yuan proceeds\nfrom the sale of high-priced Chinese bitcoins into dollars. "Certainly a portion of the premium on BTC China was a\nresult of the fact that any coins sold would be in RMB, which\nisn\'t the most portable currency," said Zennon Kapron, head of\nKapronasia, a Hong Kong-based finance and technology\nconsultancy, using an alternate term for the Chinese currency. "So if you did trade that market, getting your money back\ninto another currency is more difficult," he said.  RAPID EVOLUTION In recent days, however, the spread between bitcoins as\npriced in yuan and those priced in dollars has disappeared. An\nannouncement by China\'s central bank last week forbidding\ncommercial banks from dealing in bitcoin also contributed to the\nprice decline on BTC China. But analysts say the price convergence also reflects the\nrapid evolution of the bitcoin market, which began with\ntechnology enthusiasts but quickly expanded to include those\nwith the financial know-how to evade China\'s strict capital\ncontrols. A 27-year-old e-commerce professional from the east coast\ncity of Xiamen, who goes by the screen name \'King,\' is typical\nof early-wave amateur punters. He told Reuters that he used RChange, an online currency\nexchange and payment service based in the Seychelles, to\nexchange yuan for commercially-operated electronic currencies\nsuch as OKPay and EgoPay, which are accepted by several\ninternational bitcoin exchanges. But because such currencies\ncarry hefty charges, this method is only profitable when the\nbitcoin spread is very wide.  SOPHISTICATED ARBITRAGEURS Recently, as bitcoin has grown in popularity, more\nsophisticated arbitrageurs have stepped in. Early this month,\nChinese media began reporting that investors from Wenzhou, the\neast coastal city known for its entrepreneurial and speculative\nzeal, were piling into bitcoin. Wenzhou\'s famously tight-knit, business-savvy global\ndiaspora has given rise to the adage "Wherever there\'s a market,\nthere are Wenzhou people" and offers Wenzhou investors ready\naccess to foreign currency. Some bitcoin speculators are also likely resorting to other\ntried-and-true methods for skirting China\'s capital controls.\nThe most common is falsified trade invoices, which disguise\nmovements of speculative cash as payments for goods and\nservices. Indeed, unexpectedly strong export growth in November\nreignited suspicions that official data had been inflated by\nfake invoicing. Those suspicions centered on the conversion of dollars to\nyuan in order to profit from appreciation of the Chinese\ncurrency. But the same technique has been used to move funds in\nthe other direction. Mis-invoicing in China resulted in illicit outflows worth\n$3.79 trillion between 2000 and 2011, according to a report last\nyear by Global Financial Integrity, a think tank and advocacy\ngroup in Washington. A Shanghai-based fixed income fund manager dismissed capital\ncontrols as a barrier to shifting money around. "All of my\nclients have plenty of money offshore already," he said.       \n\n (Additional reporting by Shanghai newsroom; Editing by Richard\nBorsuk)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0JP24G20131211', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 11, 4, 55), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'China bitcoin arbitrage ends as punters work around capital controls'}, {'articleText': u'  By John Ruwitch and Pete Sweeney SHANGHAI Dec 5 China\'s government banned\nfinancial institutions from trading in bitcoin on Thursday, in\nwhat analysts said was a restrained first step towards\nregulating the digital currency that has exploded in popularity\nin China and soared in value in recent months.

LOUIS The U.S. Treasury Department\'s anti money-laundering unit is warning businesses linked to the digital currency Bitcoin that they may have to comply with federal law and regulation as money transmitters, a Treasury spokesman said. Treasury\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has sent "industry outreach" letters to about a dozen firms, regarding potential anti-money laundering compliance obligations related to Bitcoin businesses, FinCEN spokesman Steve Hudak told Thomson Reuters\' regulatory information service Compliance Complete. Bitcoin, which unlike conventional money is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central authority, has grown popular among users who lack faith in the established banking system. It has also raised concerns among law-enforcement authorities that digital currencies could be used for laundering money. The letters have had a "chilling effect" on Bitcoin businesses, which are intimidated by the threat of civil and criminal sanctions for non-compliance, said Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group. The firms, he said, may effectively be "put out of business in an extrajudicial manner." Brad Jacobsen, a lawyer representing one Bitcoin businessman who received a letter from FinCEN, said his client has chosen to suspend his business activity "while state and federal compliance matters are considered and/or appropriate exemptions are determined." FinCEN\'s letters, which ask recipients for more information about their business models, put the firms on notice that there is a legal "gray area," so they are "better off to err on the side of caution" and comply with FinCEN\'s rules, Matonis said. Certain Bitcoin businesses came under FinCEN regulation in March when the Treasury bureau issued guidance defining some players in the digital currency industry as money transmitters. For more than a decade the money-transmission industry, which includes firms such as Western Union and PayPal, has been required to enact anti-money laundering controls, report suspicious activity, register with FinCEN and obtain state licenses. These steps are required to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, the main anti-money laundering statute, and avoid running afoul of a federal law that bans unlicensed money transmitters. While some Bitcoin businesses reject FinCEN\'s assertion that they are money transmitters, a number have still registered with the agency, a search of the Treasury bureau\'s website shows. FinCEN sent letters to Bitcoin-related businesses on the Internet that appeared to fall under its definition of money transmitters but had not registered, Hudak said. He said FinCEN will keep sending letters to unregistered Bitcoin businesses. "As we come across them, and as people tip us off, we\'ll make inquiries. That is part of what we do," Hudak said. PUTTING BUSINESSES ON HOLD Mike Caldwell, who runs a business out of his Utah home that accepts digital bitcoins from customers and turns them into metal coins that hold the "private key" needed to redeem the currency, received one of FinCEN\'s letters, as first reported by the online publication Wired. Jacobsen, Caldwell\'s lawyer, told Compliance Complete that "out of an abundance of caution" Caldwell\'s business, Casascius LLC, reacted to the letter by registering with FinCEN and suspending business activity. "Laws and regulations related to virtual currencies are in a state of flux and we are working to determine how to appropriately comply with any that are applicable to our client. Casascius LLC is committed to furthering the use and acceptance of Bitcoins but is also committed to complying with applicable law," Jacobsen said. The identities of the other recipients of FinCEN\'s letters are not known. NEW ENFORCEMENT PRECEDENT A legal expert with years of experience representing digital currency firms said FinCEN seemed to be establishing a new regulatory enforcement precedent by warning individual businesses of compliance obligations before taking action. "Is this setting a new standard that in the future if there are any questionable business models there will be notice given before any action is taken?" said Carol Van Cleef, a partner with the Washington law firm Patton Boggs LLP. In response, Hudak said the letters are an attempt at gathering information. He likened them to the letters that banks sometimes send to customers seeking information about the customer\'s transactions in an effort to determine whether suspect transactions are truly linked to illicit activity.

Bitcoin is not backed by any central bank or government, or by physical assets. Their value depends on people\'s confidence in the currency. It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and investment community but have yet to become an accepted form of payment on websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com. The Bank of France said the price of bitcoin in legal currencies was inherently volatile and users may find it difficult to convert to real money. The anonymity that bitcoin offer users also raises the risk that they could also be used for money-laundering and financing of terrorism, the central bank said in a publication. "Even if bitcoin is not currently a credible investment vehicle and therefore do not pose a significant risk to financial stability, they represent a financial risk for those who hold them," the Bank of France said. Though the central bank saw no threat to its monopoly on the issuance of legal tender, bitcoin\'s growing popularity has increasingly attracted the attention of authorities in several countries, including China and the United States. The Chinese central bank warned financial institutions on Thursday against trading bitcoin, which has proven particularly popular in China. The price of the digital currency rose over $1,000 last month for the first time, extending a 400 percent surge in less than a month and fuelling concerns of a bubble in the making. The Bank of France warned that speculating on the price of bitcoin could become costly if other users became unwilling to convert gains into legal tender, potentially putting the whole system at risk of collapse if bitcoin demand evaporated. Noting a growing number of retailers and service providers who accept bitcoin for payment in France, the central bank warned they benefited from no guarantee that the bitcoin could be cashed for real money.

Bitcoin is an online currency bought and sold on a\npeer-to-peer network that is independent of central authority. The D will also accept the virtual currency at its gift\nshop, the American Coney Island restaurant and Joe Vicari\'s\nAndiamo Italian Steakhouse. "Downtown has really become a technology hub for all of Las\nVegas," Derek Stevens, co-owner and chief operating officer for\nboth casinos, told Reuters. "I think it is fitting that the\nGolden Gate and The D are the first hotels to offer (bitcoin)." Stevens said patrons increasingly had requested to use\nbitcoins over the past year. By becoming the first known casino\nhotels to accept the virtual currency, he hoped to attract\ncustomers unable to spend bitcoins at other local businesses. "I think that this is a technology where early adopters have\nan advantage," he said. The casinos will install iPads at cashier stations and use \nthe online platform BitPay to process the currency, which can be\nloaded into a virtual wallet and used with a mobile device. Since its launch in early 2009, bitcoin has gained\npopularity with people who lack confidence in conventional\nbanking. Bitcoins have a value determined by the demand for\nthem. This month, the Sacramento Kings basketball team became the\nfirst U.S. professional sports franchise to allow purchases with\nbitcoins, and Overstock.com reported being the first major\nretailer to accept the online currency. BitPay, which enables merchants to allow bitcoins as payment\nby converting them into U.S. currency, processed more than $100\nmillion worth of transactions in 2013. The currency has also raised concerns about its potential  \nuse in laundering money and for other illegal purposes.

Chinese bitcoin chat rooms buzzed last month as investors noticed that the digital currency as sold on China\'s biggest exchange was more expensive, in dollar terms, than bitcoins traded abroad using dollars, creating a tempting arbitrage play. Traders could earn profits by buying bitcoins using dollars on a foreign exchange such as Mt. Gox, reselling them for yuan at the higher price on BTC China, the main local exchange, and finally converting the yuan back to dollars. "Insane bitcoin. If you\'ve got dollars, hurry and do arbitrage," a user called \'foxtree\' wrote on Weibo, a Twitter-like micro-blogging platform, on November 19, the day the gap peaked at more than 30 percent. A key driver of the price gap was China\'s capital controls, which make it difficult for speculators to swap yuan proceeds from the sale of high-priced Chinese bitcoins into dollars. "Certainly a portion of the premium on BTC China was a result of the fact that any coins sold would be in RMB, which isn\'t the most portable currency," said Zennon Kapron, head of Kapronasia, a Hong Kong-based finance and technology consultancy, using an alternate term for the Chinese currency. "So if you did trade that market, getting your money back into another currency is more difficult," he said. RAPID EVOLUTION In recent days, however, the spread between bitcoins as priced in yuan and those priced in dollars has disappeared. An announcement by China\'s central bank last week forbidding commercial banks from dealing in bitcoin also contributed to the price decline on BTC China. But analysts say the price convergence also reflects the rapid evolution of the bitcoin market, which began with technology enthusiasts but quickly expanded to include those with the financial know-how to evade China\'s strict capital controls. A 27-year-old e-commerce professional from the east coast city of Xiamen, who goes by the screen name \'King,\' is typical of early-wave amateur punters. He told Reuters that he used RChange, an online currency exchange and payment service based in the Seychelles, to exchange yuan for commercially-operated electronic currencies such as OKPay and EgoPay, which are accepted by several international bitcoin exchanges. But because such currencies carry hefty charges, this method is only profitable when the bitcoin spread is very wide. SOPHISTICATED ARBITRAGEURS Recently, as bitcoin has grown in popularity, more sophisticated arbitrageurs have stepped in. Early this month, Chinese media began reporting that investors from Wenzhou, the east coastal city known for its entrepreneurial and speculative zeal, were piling into bitcoin. Wenzhou\'s famously tight-knit, business-savvy global diaspora has given rise to the adage "Wherever there\'s a market, there are Wenzhou people" and offers Wenzhou investors ready access to foreign currency. Some bitcoin speculators are also likely resorting to other tried-and-true methods for skirting China\'s capital controls. The most common is falsified trade invoices, which disguise movements of speculative cash as payments for goods and services. Indeed, unexpectedly strong export growth in November reignited suspicions that official data had been inflated by fake invoicing. Those suspicions centered on the conversion of dollars to yuan in order to profit from appreciation of the Chinese currency. But the same technique has been used to move funds in the other direction. Mis-invoicing in China resulted in illicit outflows worth $3.79 trillion between 2000 and 2011, according to a report last year by Global Financial Integrity, a think tank and advocacy group in Washington. A Shanghai-based fixed income fund manager dismissed capital controls as a barrier to shifting money around. "All of my clients have plenty of money offshore already," he said.

Silbert told a group of journalists at his company\'s New York headquarters the fund, named the Bitcoin Investment Trust, has 90 investors, among them hedge fund traders and private family investment firms. Using investor contributions and seed money of more than $2 million from SecondMarket, the BIT, as it is known, has been buying Bitcoins from a wide array of sources, including exchanges, merchants and individual users. The fund is also buying the digital currency from "miners," who are producing it by running programs that interact with Bitcoin\'s software to make new units of the currency. The BIT is structured like an electronically traded fund and modeled, according to Silbert, after one of the most prominent gold ETFs, but it is not publicly traded and will not be for several more years. SecondMarket launched the fund at the end of September. As the value of the floating currency, which is not governed by any central bank or company, increases, shares in the BIT will increase in value too. The price of one unit of Bitcoin was listed at $920 on the website of Mt.Gox, a firm that buys and sells Bitcoin in exchange for dollars and other currencies. A month ago, on November 11, it was $361, according to Mt.Gox. The most direct competition with Silbert\'s fund comes from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers famous for their legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of Facebook. The two announced earlier this year they would launch a publicly traded ETF called Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. They are awaiting approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Silbert said he decided not to wait for SEC approval to launch SecondMarket\'s fund because it could take years. SecondMarket is known as a platform for selling and trading private investments. In a statement to Reuters on Wednesday Cameron Winklevoss said: "We designed our product to allow all investors to be able to invest and believe that SEC review is an important part of the process. "Trading on an exchange as a public vehicle removes friction and provides shareholders with liquidity and transparency," he added. SecondMarket was one of the two most prominent places to trade shares of Facebook before the social media company\'s initial public offerings debuted. Silbert said early next year BIT investors will be able to begin trading in shares of the fund on a limited basis through a process similar to the pre-IPO Facebook trading. JOBS ACT BOOST Silbert said new SEC rules stemming from a 2012 law known as the JOBS Act, which lifted the ban on advertising by private investment companies, have helped draw new customers to the fund. "We knew the JOBS Act was a big opportunity," Silbert said, adding the new advertising freedoms had allowed SecondMarket to start a website displaying the fund\'s performance and to describe the fund to a wider pool of potential investors. "It\'s been huge." People whose personal wealth meets certain standards can now buy into the fund through three brokerages selling shares in it to customers with self-directed Individual Retirement Accounts. Fidelity last week became the latest brokerage to begin selling BIT shares, joining Pensco and Entrust. To invest in the BIT, individuals have to prove their net worth is $1 million, not counting primary residence, or that they draw annual incomes of more than $200,000. The minimum buy-in amount is $25,000. Critics have said the JOBS Act will expose more people with fragile finances to potential scams or simply to deals with a high likelihood of collapse.

"A major tenet of the NBA 3.0 philosophy is about utilizing technology for the betterment of the fan experience, and this is yet another step in that process," he added.

Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\'s Department of\nFinancial Services, expects to adopt enhanced consumer\ndisclosure rules, capital requirements and a framework for\npermissible investments with consumer money. Lawsky has said he plans to issue a "BitLicense" for\nbusinesses that use the new currencies, and he intends to\nprovide regulations this year, which could make New York the\nfirst U.S. state to regulate virtual currencies such as\nbitcoins. In a speech in Washington on Tuesday, Lawsky said consumers\nneed to know that virtual currency transactions are generally\nirreversible, and that they could lose their principal if they\nhold onto bitcoins for an extended period. Lawsky said more challenging questions include what capital\nrequirements firms must have on balance sheets to absorb\nunexpected losses, and how many risks they can take with\ninvestments using consumer money. One issue is whether the firms\nshould be allowed to invest in virtual currencies. "Our objective is to provide appropriate guard rails to\nprotect consumers and root out money laundering - without\nstifling beneficial innovation," Lawsky said in prepared remarks\nfor an event at the New America Foundation. His agency is still wrestling with whether to ban or\nrestrict the use of "tumblers", which obscure the record and\nsource of virtual currencies. He said tumblers are a concern to\nlaw enforcement, but that they might have legitimate uses. He said most virtual currencies have public ledgers which,\nwhen combined with know-your-customer guidelines, could serve as\nanti-money laundering controls. Lawsky added that he is grappling with what types of firms\nand transactions to regulate. The remarks follow two days of hearings in New York on the\npotential regulation of virtual currencies. Witnesses at the\nlate January hearings included state and federal prosecutors, as\nwell as industry participants such as the investor twins Cameron\nand Tyler Winklevoss.

The value of a bitcoin soared from $13 in January to a high of $266 in April as more businesses and consumers used them to buy and sell online. Some investors are also treating bitcoins like gold, using them to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on their rise. The kiosk, which looks like the average ATM but with hand and barcode scanners, opened for business on Tuesday and by mid-morning people were lined up to swap their bitcoins for cash, or to deposit cash to buy more bitcoins. "It\'s as easy as walking up to a machine, scanning your hand, entering some cash and buying bitcoin," said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Las Vegas-based Robocoin, the company that builds the ATMs. "With this, it\'s a 2-minute process. For any online exchange, it\'s at least two days." Bitcoins, currently worth about $210 each, can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses, thereby cutting fees. Users can buy products and services online or in a handful of stores, including the Waves coffee shop where the ATM is. With the bitcoin ATM, users scan their hand to confirm identity, then funds move to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphone. The system limits transfers to $1,000 a day, in an effort to curb money laundering and other fraud. Bitcoiniacs, the local dealer that operates the ATM, will roll out four other kiosks across Canada in December. Robocoin said Canada was the ideal place to launch the kiosk due to a critical mass of users and less stringent oversight than in the United States, where the bitcoin trade is monitored by anti-money laundering regulators. "We think the Vancouver market is enormous and we\'re excited to be here," said Kelley. "By the end 2013, we\'ll be all over Canada. By the end of 2014, we\'ll be all over the world, including the United States." Bitcoin is not a recognized currency in Canada, so Ottawa\'s anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, does not monitor its trade. Still Bitcoiniacs\' founders say they are working with the agency to be ready for when Canada does start regulating them. "We\'re already being proactive in our business," said Bitcoiniacs co-founder Mitchell Demeter. "We abide by any guidelines they would impose - which includes the \'know you customer\' laws and anti-money laundering laws." GOING MAINSTREAM Bitcoins were launched in 2008 and are traded within a global network of computers. They are not backed by a single company or government, but their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system\'s control over the minting of money. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. The currency\'s reputation took a hit this month, when U.S. regulators shut down Silk Road, an online marketplace used to buy and sell illegal drugs, and seized $3.6 million in bitcoins. But the virtual currency is gaining hold among businesses and consumers, a key step to a bigger role. "I think it\'s definitely going mainstream," said Demeter. "I think as things progress, and the infrastructure is built, it will become easier for people to buy and sell, and so more people will start using it." In Vancouver, for example, dozens of people attend weekly bitcoin meet-ups and a member co-op is promoting the currency to a growing list of local retailers. At Waves, Vancouver resident Chung Cheong used bitcoin to pay for his mug of tea and was happy to mull over the future of the digital currency. "It\'s been said that we\'re at the stage where email was in 1992," he said. "Is it risky? Sure. But look at how the Internet and email changed the world."

The European Banking Authority said there was no protection\nor compensation for people whose "digital wallets" are hacked, a\ntransfer of virtual money goes wrong or a platform is shut. The warning follows similar announcements from the Bank of\nFrance and the Chinese central bank. The EBA stopped short of telling consumers not to use online\ncurrency markets but said if they end up out of pocket there\nwon\'t be a safety net like the compensation given to deposit\nholders when a mainstream EU bank goes bust. "Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the\nEU that would protect consumers from financial losses if a\nplatform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or\ngoes out of business," EBA said in a statement. Bitcoin is not backed by any central bank or government, or\nby physical assets. Its value depends on people\'s confidence in\nthe currency. It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and\ninvestment community but has yet to become an accepted form of\npayment on websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com\n. "Cases have been reported of consumers losing significant\namounts of virtual currency, with little prospect of having it\nreturned. Also, when using virtual currency for commercial\ntransactions, consumers are not protected by any refund rights\nunder EU law," said the EBA. The watchdog has been studying virtual currencies for three\nmonths and is still considering whether they can or ought to be\nregulated. It has powers to ban them, though questions remain\nover how this could be done in practice. There are about 100 virtual currencies, with new ones\nappearing every week. Bitcoin is by far the best known. The price of the bitcoin rose above $1,000 last month for\nthe first time, extending a 400 percent surge in less than a\nmonth and fuelling concerns of a bubble. EU regulatory officials doubt such published estimates as\nthe currency and the platforms that trade it are not regulated. Some platforms have been closed down amid concerns there\ncould be a risk of money laundering, leaving those who held\nmoney on them nursing temporary or permanent losses.

Trendon Shavers of Bitcoin Savings & Trust had challenged\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission\'s case against him, \nsaying the regulator had no jurisdiction to sue him because the\nBitcoin investments he offered are not securities or subject to\nany U.S. regulation. But U.S. Magistrate Judge Amos L. Mazzant in the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas ruled on Tuesday that his Bitcoin investments\n"meet the definition of investment contract, and as such, are\nsecurities." Bitcoin exists through an open-source software program. It\nis not managed by any one company, it is not regulated by any\ncentral bank, and its supply is controlled through a computer\nalgorithm. Users can buy bitcoins through exchanges that convert\nreal money into the virtual currency. The SEC warned investors against the dangers of potential\nscams involving virtual currencies like Bitcoin in an alert on\nJuly 23, the same day it filed the charges against Shavers\n. Tuesday\'s ruling could have important implications for the\nstill murky legal world surrounding digital currencies, which is\nnot regulated by the United States. Bitcoin has come under greater scrutiny after U.S.\nauthorities in May seized two accounts linked to a major\noperator in the Bitcoin digital market. The judge\'s decision could be important for Cameron and\nTyler Winklevoss, the twins who became famous after alleging\nthat Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg stole their\nwebsite idea. In early July, they applied to the SEC for approval to\nlaunch a Bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded product known as the\nWinklevoss Bitcoin Trust. The SEC alleges that Shavers essentially used money from new\ninvestors in his Bitcoin endeavor to cover withdrawals by older\ninvestors and his own personal expenses. The agency said he raised at least 700,000 bitcoins, or $4.5\nmillion, from investors in multiple states. Shavers had asserted that his Bitcoin investments are not\nsecurities because Bitcoin is not money, but the SEC countered\nthat they constituted both investment contracts and notes.

"The next step for Bitcoin is potentially becoming the currency of a country," Tyler Winklevoss said. The twin brothers, famous for their history with Facebook Inc, were speaking at the 9th annual Value Investing Congress in New York. Speaking less than three months after filing plans to launch the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an exchange traded fund that would allow investors to trade the digital currency like stocks, the brothers laid out a primer on Bitcoin and spoke about what might be next for the currency. Bitcoins, touted by some experts as the future of money, gained in prominence during Europe\'s financial crisis as more people questioned the safety of holding their cash in the bank. With Bitcoin there are no bail-ins like in Cyprus," Tyler Winklevoss said. The brothers added that they expect to see a financial implosion in Cyrus in the next year or two and said that was one reason to use Bitcoin. In bail-ins, some of the debt owed to creditors, including bondholders, is written off. The brothers, Olympic rowers who earned MBA degrees from Oxford University, told regulators in July that they plan to initially sell $20 million worth of shares, with each share worth a fraction of a Bitcoin. They said they could not speak in greater detail about their own fund right now. But they laid out what they to be the benefits of the digital currency, saying sending money abroad would be easier and cheaper and it would allow charitable donations to be made more easily. Most presenters, including some prominent hedge fund managers, give one or two of their best stock picks at the conference. While the Winklevoss twins made a more general case for the digital currency, their presentation resonated with the audience and the brothers fielded more questions than any of the previous presenters.

Today, a multicity angel network and incubator dedicated solely to Bitcoin startups announced that it has raised nearly $6.7 million in about a week to fund Bitcoin startups. BitAngels\xa0formed on Sunday at the Bitcoin 2013 Conference in San Jose, Calif. Investors, entrepreneurs, and people in the Bitcoin community came together to discuss the future of money. BitAngels rose out of those interactions as an online place where Bitcoin startups and investors could connect. Startups that are using digital currency to disrupt an existing industry can apply. If accepted, they receive $25,000 as well as 1,000 hours per month of support from developers, designers, business developers, and advisers in the community. The investor network now has 60 members and can use BitAngel to search for promising opportunities. \u201cBitAngels is aiming to accelerate new Bitcoin startups from weekend tech hobbies and/or early-stage \u201cgarage startups\u201d to full time, professionally run and consumer friendly services,\u201d said executive director David A. Johnston. \u201cThe group will accomplish this by matching new entrepreneurs with veteran entrepreneurs as co-founders / advisors and providing enough funding for them to leave their day jobs and focus on their new companies. Think of it as a distributed version of Y-Combinator, just focused on Bitcoin Startups.\u201d Bitcoin is a controversial topic that attracts both excitement and skepticism from people across multiple industries. It is a form of digital currency that uses decentralized, peer-to-peer technology to manage transactions and validate payments instead of a government-regulated banking system. Bitcoin value is volatile and subject to malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks. Earlier this month, top Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox was sued by a startup called Coinlab for $75 million after a failed partnership. Despite these drawbacks, Bitcoin value has also shot up over the past few months and companies like Reddit, WordPress, Expensify, and OKCupid have started accepting Bitcoins as payment. Y Combinator startup Coinbase recently raised $5 million from Union Square Ventures in the largest funding round to date for a Bitcoin company. \u201cBitcoin is basically The New Internet, built on top of the existing Internet,\u201dJohnston said. \u201cToday people think of it as a payment method, but the technology is going to enable so much more than that. Right now companies are launching early stage efforts to completely disrupt stock trading, bonds, titles, agreements, smart property, messaging, and a dozen other now centralized industries. In short, decentralized solutions are going to outcompete centralized services in a lot of industries very quickly.\xa0Bitcoin is not only here to stay, but your grandmother will be using it in the very near future\u201d No-one really knows what will happen with Bitcoin. It could change the way people think of money and transform the entire landscape for payments. Or it could prove too unstable and never make significant inroads into the financial industry. BitAngel\u2019s goal is to create an environment that supports startups taking on these challenges and make Bitcoin more mainstream. Along with the funding, network, and mentorship, Bitcoin startups will also be able to work out of three on-site locations in New York, San Francisco, and Austin, Texas.

But he didn\'t mine it the way you are supposed to by following a set of instructions using a specialized algorithm to create the digital currency, then waiting to snag one of the 21 million Bitcoins that will be generated by the year 2140. Developed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym, each Bitcoin gets a serial number and ownership is transferred between online accounts called wallets. They can be traded via online markets and accepted for payment by merchants. Instead, Chen ginned one up on his 3-D printer. It is a bright yellow, grooved disc with a raised B on one side. "It\'s just a toy," he says, showing it off at the regular Thursday night Bitcoin Meetup in New York City. Chen only owns one "real" Bitcoin, but he\'s interested in accepting the currency at his tech shop, xCubicle, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and in disruptive technologies in general. Chen once speculated in Iraqi currency because he thought it would go up in value as the country rebuilt, like the German currency after World War II. But that did not happen. "Bitcoin is like the lottery. It\'s a gamble," Chen says. What Bitcoin is intended to be, however, is a currency - a virtual currency that exists independently of any government. Bitcoins are "mined" by software running a set of algorithms and their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system\'s control over the minting of money. There are just over 11 million Bitcoins in circulation now, currently worth an estimated $1.2 billion. And while some people insist it\'s just a fad, Bitcoin enthusiasts say it is the future. But with extreme volatility in the price of Bitcoins since the start of 2013 - they went from $13 in January to a peak of $266 in April to around $100 today - the outlook is hazy, even as trading gets more popular.

But he didn\'t mine it the way you are supposed to by\nfollowing a set of instructions using a specialized algorithm to\ncreate the digital currency, then waiting to snag one of the 21\nmillion Bitcoins that will be generated by the year 2140. Developed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym, each\nBitcoin gets a serial number and ownership is transferred\nbetween online accounts called wallets. They can be traded via\nonline markets and accepted for payment by merchants. Instead, Chen ginned one up on his 3-D printer. It is a\nbright yellow, grooved disc with a raised B on one side. "It\'s just a toy," he says, showing it off at the regular\nThursday night Bitcoin Meetup in New York City. Chen only owns one "real" Bitcoin, but he\'s interested in\naccepting the currency at his tech shop, xCubicle, on the Lower\nEast Side of Manhattan, and in disruptive technologies in\ngeneral. Chen once speculated in Iraqi currency because he\nthought it would go up in value as the country rebuilt, like the\nGerman currency after World War II. But that did not happen. "Bitcoin is like the lottery. It\'s a gamble," Chen says. What Bitcoin is intended to be, however, is a currency - a\nvirtual currency that exists independently of any government. Bitcoins are "mined" by software running a set of algorithms\nand their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central\nbanking system\'s control over the minting of money. There are\njust over 11 million Bitcoins in circulation now, currently\nworth an estimated $1.2 billion. And while some people insist it\'s just a fad, Bitcoin\nenthusiasts say it is the future. But with extreme volatility in\nthe price of Bitcoins since the start of 2013 - they went from\n$13 in January to a peak of $266 in April to around $100 today -\nthe outlook is hazy, even as trading gets more popular.

With this trust, you\u2019ll be able to safeguard your Bitcoin investments with a pair of blonde, Harvard-educated rowers instead of a bunch of neckbeards who can barely keep their websites from being hacked. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are the twin brothers who sued Facebook, alleging that they played a role in founding the social network and that CEO Mark Zuckerberg shorted them in with a 2008 cash-and-stock settlement. In 2011, they ended their appeals and agreed to accept the terms of the settlement, then worth $65 million. (It could be worth as much as $300 million now.) (I know, I know.

Gox might appear\nsudden, but bitcoin insiders say its downfall began nearly a\nyear ago as the virtual currency exchange tangled with\nregulators, split from former business partners and grappled\nwith cyber attacks. Mt. Gox\'s fall lays bare the difficulties the bitcoin\ncommunity faces as it tries to square its freewheeling,\nlibertarian ideals with the rigorous regulation required in\nfinancial services and customers\' needs for reliable service. To be sure, Mt. Gox may return. Its Tokyo-based chief\nexecutive, Mark Karpeles, has said he is working hard to solve\nthe problems that forced the exchange to halt trading this week\nafter suspending withdrawals on Feb. 7. But its road back, if there is one, will be difficult. U.S. federal prosecutors have subpoenaed Mt. Gox - and other\nbitcoin businesses - to seek information on a spate of\ndisruptive cyber attacks. And Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin\nexchange, has now been surpassed by others, such as\nSlovenia-based Bitstamp. "The first wave of entrepreneurs were evangelists for the\ntechnology, but low on quality," said Nick Shalek, an investor\nat Ribbit Capital, which has backed bitcoin companies including\ndigital-wallet Coinbase. Now, he said, a more serious group of\nentrepreneurs is trying to build more serious infrastructure\naround bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital currency that, unlike conventional\nmoney, is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent\nof central control. Its value has soared in the last year, and\nthe total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion. Mt. Gox\'s decline, ironically, started just as bitcoin was\nhitting a new level of notoriety in the broader public.\nProponents include prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists\nwho talked up a virtual currency system free of government\nintervention or control.    THE FACE OF BITCOIN Founded in 2009 by American software hacker Jed McCaleb, Mt.\nGox was originally a site for people to trade cards for a game\ncalled "Magic: The Gathering." (Mt. Gox is short for "Magic: The\nGathering Online Exchange") McCaleb turned the site into a bitcoin exchange and sold the\nfledgling business in 2011 to Karpeles. Under the Frenchman, Mt.\nGox became the face of bitcoin - where investors regularly\nchecked the price of the digital currency and where the largest\nvolume of trades occurred. As regulators started to take notice of the bitcoin market,\nKarpeles became a vocal champion. He described Mt. Gox as "the\nmain exchange" and argued for bitcoin\'s legitimacy while trying\nto distance it from criminals using the digital currency for\nmoney laundering or drug-related activities. Karpeles said Mt. Gox had no interest in helping criminals\nlaunder funds, and pushed back against claims that bitcoin\ntransactions were completely anonymous, noting that while the\nsystem was designed for privacy, it was easy to track bitcoins\nacross the network. If authorities found a way to shut down Mt. Gox, "the likely\nresult will be more exchanges popping up all over, with methods\nmuch harder to track, and who will be much less likely to agree\nto help with any investigation," Karpeles said in a 2011 email\nto a reporter for the Compliance Complete service of Thomson\nReuters Accelus. "We want (authorities) to understand that the problem is not\nbitcoin itself, but what some people do with those," he said in\nthe message, one of numerous emailed exchanges over the years. In 2011, bitcoin was barely trading at $1, but volumes were\npicking up at Mt. Gox, which routinely saw more than 20,000\ntransactions daily, more than double those in late 2010. Karpeles said Mt. Gox had servers in the United States but\nlittle in the way of money. It used Iowa-based online payment\nprocessor Dwolla Inc to make U.S. customer transactions easier.  RISE IN POPULARITY Bitcoin\'s popularity increased incrementally, similar to its\nprice. On April 1, 2013, it topped $100 for the first time, and\ntrading volumes were increasing. Around this time, a regulatory push intensified. The U.S.\nTreasury Department\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(FinCEN) declared bitcoin exchanges to be money transmitters,\nrequiring them to register, enact formal anti-money laundering\nprograms, and report suspicious activity. Shortly after that, a bitcoin exchange known as bitfloor was\nshuttered after its U.S. bank account was closed because it had\nnot properly registered with regulators. Concerns that regulatory action would cause customer funds\nto be trapped resulted in a sharp plunge in bitcoin, falling\nfrom $230 on April 10 to a low of $68.49 on April 17 - a period\nof time that turned out to be the peak in terms of\ndollar-denominated trading on Mt. Gox, according to\nBitcoincharts. It was a sign of the increased regulatory scrutiny the\nvirtual currency would receive. Karpeles said in an April 13 email that bitfloor\'s closure\nwas a fate that would not befall Mt. Gox. "We apply very strict\nAML (anti-money laundering) procedures to avoid exactly this\nkind of issue. We have very good relationships with our banking\npartners and making sure everything is run as good as possible." On April 18, Karpeles clarified that Dwolla was the\ncompany\'s only transaction provider. "We do not use any U.S.\nbank," he said via email. Mt. Gox did not immediately register with FinCEN - a misstep\nthat would in part lead to its demise. In May 2013, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security froze\nan account that Dwolla held at Veridian Credit Union in the name\nof Mutum Sigillum LLC, a Mt. Gox subsidiary incorporated in\nDelaware. A related court document said another account at Wells\nFargo had been seized earlier that month. The Department\nof Homeland Security justified the seizures by accusing Mt. Gox\nof failing to register with Treasury as demanded by FinCEN. (It\neventually registered in June.) Karpeles has declined to comment on the seizures, but this\ncomplicated the ability of Mt. Gox to allow U.S. customers to\nliquidate existing investments. Dwolla eventually ended its\nrelationship with Mt. Gox, in a blow to the exchange. "Most professional users moved away from Mt. Gox months ago,\nleaving April 2013 or thereabouts. By June 2013, the final nail\nwas in the coffin for U.S. users," said one of bitcoin\'s core\ndevelopers, who requested anonymity. This in turn caused bitcoin\'s prices on Mt. Gox to surge. "What happened then is because you couldn\'t withdraw\ndollars, there became a major premium for bitcoin on Mt. Gox,"\nsaid Jacob Dienelt, a maker of bitcoin paper wallets in New\nYork.  CYBER ATTACKS The rise in bitcoin\'s value gave it more cachet with the\ngeneral public, even though most people were still uninformed\nabout exactly what bitcoin was. Dollar trading volumes started to diminish on Mt. Gox then -\nfrom about 66,770 transactions daily in May to a little over\n14,000 in September. Volumes surged for a few months, but\ndropped to about 9,000 daily by January, according to\nbitcoincharts. Those in the industry said Mt. Gox ceased to be the exchange\nof choice about nine months ago as competitors such as Bitstamp\ngained prominence. By the start of this year, Mt. Gox was\nconsidered a diminished player due to concerns about its\ntechnology and safety. "It was obvious there was something really bad going on\nthere for nearly a year. They were processing withdrawals very\nslowly and generally being very opaque about what was going on,"\nsaid Mike Hearn, a bitcoin developer based in Switzerland. Mt. Gox\'s problems earlier this month stemmed from\n"distributed denial of service" attacks, where hackers sent\nthousands of phantom transactions to the exchange to slow its\noperations. Other exchanges experienced this problem as well,\nbut were able to restore service more quickly. The hackers exploited a process used by some bitcoin\nexchanges that introduced "malleability" into the code governing\ntransactions, experts said. Simply put, this allowed hackers to\nslightly alter the details of codes to create thousands of\ncopies of transactions. These copies slowed the exchanges to a\ncrawl, forcing them to independently verify each transaction to\ndetermine what was real and what was fake. "It was a well-known issue that every major exchange in the\nbitcoin community knew about and had solutions for. Mt. Gox did\nnot," said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Robocoin, the\nworld\'s first bitcoin ATM maker. A document circulating on the internet purporting to be a\ncrisis plan for Mt. Gox, said more than 744,000 bitcoins were\n"missing due to malleability-related theft" and noted Mt. Gox\nhad $174 million in liabilities against $32.75 million in\nassets. It was not possible to verify the document. If accurate,\nthough, it would mean about 6 percent of the 12.4 million\nbitcoins minted would be considered missing. As questions swirl about where the bitcoins and money Mt.\nGox supposedly possessed ended up, some in the industry\nspeculate that Mt. Gox\'s problems stem fundamentally from\nfinancial mismanagement. If the company was selling more\nbitcoins than it could acquire, it may have gotten behind in its\nattempts to balance its own books. "We are currently at a turning point for the business,"\nKarpeles said in an email on Tuesday, adding that an\nannouncement would come soon.

LOUIS, May 17 (Thomson Reuters Accelus) - U.S. authorities have seized two accounts linked to a major operator in the booming Bitcoin digital currency market, Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox. The move may prevent the firm from facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoins in U.S. dollars at a time when use of the currency and its value has mushroomed. Bitcoin, which unlike conventional money is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central authority, has grown popular among users who lack faith in the established banking system. The price of the volatile currency ballooned in March as a result of the Cyprus bank crisis. Authorities worry that a lack of regulation has left the currency vulnerable to money launderers and other criminals. A seizure warrant obtained Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security froze an account that an Iowa-based online payment processor, Dwolla Inc, held at Veridian Credit Union in the name of Mutum Sigillum LLC. An affidavit filed by an agent with the department\'s investigations unit states that Mutum Sigillum, a Mt. Gox subsidiary incorporated in Delaware, was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter, in violation of federal law. Treasury\'s anti-money laundering unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), in March issued guidance that dubbed digital currency exchanges money transmitters, a finding that obliged such businesses to register with FinCEN and obtain any mandated state licenses. A search of FinCEN\'s online registration database Friday morning suggested that neither Mt. Gox nor Mutum Sigillum had registered. The affidavit cited Mutum Sigillum\'s failure to register with FinCEN as sufficient grounds to seize its accounts. Both Mutum Sigillum and Mt. Gox, which says it handles 80 percent of Bitcoin trading, are owned by Mark Karpeles, the affidavit states. It adds that Karpeles opened an account in Mutum Sigillum\'s name at Wells Fargo in May 2011, and that when doing so completed a form in which he said it was not a money transmitter. Karpeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did Dwolla. The Wells Fargo account was seized earlier this month as part of the same investigation that prompted the seizure of Mutum Sigillum\'s Dwolla account at Veridian Credit Union, the affidavit states. It also notes that those wishing to use U.S. dollars to buy Bitcoins deposited money with Dwolla and directed that it be forwarded to Mt. Gox. When people wanted to cash out, Mt. Gox wired funds from an account at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank in Japan to the Wells Fargo account and U.S. dollars were sent to Dwolla. An Homeland Security department informant based in Maryland engaged in such transactions, the affidavit states, presenting the informant\'s Bitcoin exchanges as evidence of Mutum Sigillum\'s purported status as a money transfer firm. The seizure of the Mt. Gox-linked accounts may threaten the exchange\'s ability to do business in U.S. dollars. The impact on the overall Bitcoin market is unclear. Some Mt. Gox customers have already taken to message boards to express concern about their ability to buy Bitcoins with U.S. dollars or liquidate existing investments. One user posting on a Bitcoin question and answer site suggested this problem was a grave one for the currency and Mt. Gox. "Most of the trading volume is in dollars at Gox if I\'m not mistaken, so this might be the death blow for them," the user\'s post stated. Thomson Reuters\' Compliance Complete reported last month that Karpeles said all of Mt. Gox\'s U.S.-dollar activity was accomplished via a Dwolla account. When Compliance Complete asked at the time whether Mt. Gox had registered with FinCEN in the wake of the March guidance, Karpeles said that it had not, but that it planned to do so. He added that Mt. Gox and Dwolla were "discussing compliance issues on a regular basis." A spokeswoman for Homeland Security declined to comment on whether the agency, or any foreign law enforcement agency with which it may be cooperating, plan to seize any other accounts linked to Karpeles, Mt. Gox, or other Bitcoin exchanges.  (This article was produced by the Compliance Complete service of Thomson Reuters Accelus.

Bart Chilton, one of five commissioners at the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission, said he had asked staff to explore\nwhether consumers needed more protection from any mishaps with\nBitcoin, whose value collapsed last month. "Here\'s what I know for sure: we could regulate it if we\nwanted. That is very clear," Chilton told Reuters in an\ninterview on Monday. The Financial Times was first to report on\nChilton\'s plans. Bitcoin, a digital currency that can be moved via computer\nor smartphone without a financial intermediary, has gained in\nprominence as people start to question the safety of holding\ntheir cash in the bank. It shot up in value in March, when\ninvestors took fright at the next turn of the euro zone debt\ncrisis. But the price of one "coin" plunged to $130 from a record\nhigh of $260 on April 10. The CFTC\'s remit has been vastly expanded after the 2007-09\nfinancial crisis when it was tasked with writing rules for the\n$650 trillion swaps market. "There is potentially a federal role here, and we have to\nmake sure that we\'re on guard that whatever is traded is\nappropriately regulated," Chilton said. Chilton is an often outspoken Democrat on the CFTC\'s board,\nand the adoption of any regulation he is pushing for depends on\nthe support of the others on the board, as well as what the\nCFTC\'s lawyers and other experts say.

Bart Chilton, one of five commissioners at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said he had asked staff to explore whether consumers needed more protection from any mishaps with Bitcoin, whose value collapsed last month. "Here\'s what I know for sure: we could regulate it if we wanted. That is very clear," Chilton told Reuters in an interview on Monday. The Financial Times was first to report on Chilton\'s plans. Bitcoin, a digital currency that can be moved via computer or smartphone without a financial intermediary, has gained in prominence as people start to question the safety of holding their cash in the bank. It shot up in value in March, when investors took fright at the next turn of the euro zone debt crisis. But the price of one "coin" plunged to $130 from a record high of $260 on April 10. The CFTC\'s remit has been vastly expanded after the 2007-09 financial crisis when it was tasked with writing rules for the $650 trillion swaps market. "There is potentially a federal role here, and we have to make sure that we\'re on guard that whatever is traded is appropriately regulated," Chilton said. Chilton is an often outspoken Democrat on the CFTC\'s board, and the adoption of any regulation he is pushing for depends on the support of the others on the board, as well as what the CFTC\'s lawyers and other experts say. A spokesman for the CFTC declined to comment. The absence of physical Bitcoins meant people investing in the currency to speculate on a rise in its value could not be said to participate in cash markets, Chilton said, bringing them within the remit of the CFTC\'s mandate. "If you\'re buying Bitcoin and you are hoping that their value increases ... and you could purchase something with them in a day or a week or a month or a year, that is clearly a derivative of the actual Bitcoin," Chilton said.

Gox, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Friday, saying it may have lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of the virtual coins due to hacking into its faulty computer system. The collapse caps a tumultuous few weeks in which the company has remained virtually silent after halting trades of the crypto-currency, shaking the nascent but burgeoning bitcoin community. Wearing a suit instead of his customary T-shirt, Mt. Gox\'s French CEO Mark Karpeles bowed in contrition and apologized in Japanese at a news conference at the Tokyo District Court, blaming his firm\'s collapse on a "weakness in our system", but predicting that bitcoin would continue to grow. "First of all, I\'m very sorry," he said. "The bitcoin industry is healthy and it is growing. It will continue, and reducing the impact is the most important point." Angry investors have been seeking answers for what happened to their holdings of cash and bitcoins on the unregulated Tokyo-based exchange. Gregory Greene, who estimated his bitcoin stake at $25,000, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Chicago late on Thursday, saying Mt. Gox had failed "to provide its users with the level of security protection for which they paid. Baker & McKenzie, a Chicago-based law firm that represents Mt. Gox, declined to comment. It is not yet clear if the firm is representing the exchange in this lawsuit. Mt. Gox said the exchange, used overwhelmingly by foreigners, had lost 750,000 of its users\' bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. At the current bitcoin price of about $565, that would total some $480 million - representing about 7 percent of the estimated global total of bitcoins. "This may be telling for the level of traceability of the transactions. Bitcoin has been telling us that it is more traceable than cash. The question is, how much more and is there the potential for real recourse in the case of theft," said Moshe Cohen, assistant professor at Columbia Business School in New York. Mt. Gox said there was a discrepancy of 2.8 billion yen ($27.4 million) in its bank accounts when it checked on Monday. Junko Suetomi, a lawyer with Baker & MacKenzie, said she could not comment on the balances of foreign bank accounts held by the company. PROBLEM WITH EXCHANGE, NOT BITCOIN Many bitcoin market participants have said Mt. Gox\'s problems were specific to the company and were caused by what they said was a lax attitude by Karpeles, while bitcoin itself - free of any central bank control - was still a noble venture. "If we could agree on legal regulation, we should let (bitcoin and regulators) co-exist," said Keiichi Hida, a bitcoin investor and member of the Japan Digital Money Association. He lost about 100,000 yen worth of bitcoins, but seemed unconcerned as he became interested in the virtual currency as a form of "study". "We should make it a national project to have bitcoin used nationwide at the time of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics," he said. Mt. Gox shut its website on Tuesday after freezing withdrawals earlier this month in the wake of a series of technical difficulties. The exchange had liabilities of 6.5 billion yen ($63.67 million), dwarfing its total assets of 3.84 billion yen, the company said. It had 127,000 creditors in bankruptcy, just over 1,000 of whom are Japanese. The company and Karpeles have said little in the days before Friday\'s court filing, which is similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, except that they were working with others to resolve their problems. Another lawyer, Akio Shinomiya at Yodoyabashi and Yamagami, said Mt. Gox wanted to file a criminal complaint against what he said was a hacking attack, but had no specific means of doing so. "Bitcoin has always been volatile and speculative, said bitcoin user Ken Shishido, who had about a tenth of his bitcoin holdings at Mt. Gox, but has seen the rest of his bitcoins soar tenfold since he began trading 18 months ago. "It\'s too bad that this happened, but we have to let it go. And then we\'ll buy more." Fortress Investment Group became one of the first big investors to say it had lost money investing in bitcoin.

Workers at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in London and New York have been visiting online Bitcoin exchanges as often as 30 times a day, according to documents seen by Reuters. Neither bank wanted to comment. Employees at almost all the major international banks and numerous trading and investment firms have shown interest. Bitcoin has become the Wild West of finance, with a proliferation of websites offering loosely regulated replicas of the services familiar to those in the financial industry. There is a Bitcoin stock exchange, where companies can make initial public offerings and pay dividends in Bitcoin. One website offering Bitcoin options trading was \u2018listed\' this month for an implied valuation of half a million dollars. Perhaps the most notorious is Bitcoinica, a platform offering margin trading, short selling and stop orders run by 17-year-old Chinese high school student Zhou Tong.

THE ANTI-BANK SYSTEM Its popularity with financial professionals highlights an irony at the heart of the Bitcoin usership; suspicion of the banking system is written into the program\'s DNA. It was released in January 2009 by a developer using the probable pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Embedded in the code of its first block of transaction history are the words \u2018The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\'. This was a way of time-stamping the first Bitcoin transaction, but also a clue to the developer\'s motivation. Before disappearing as an online presence in January 2010, Nakamoto made clear his disapproval of quantitative easing measures and blamed banks for creating credit bubbles. Such sentiments are common among users. "There are no bailouts of banks on Bitcoin," one put it. WHAT IS IT FOR? The Greek owner of an island bar and restaurant who accepts payment in Bitcoin alongside euros told Reuters he liked the currency because it was the opposite of a banking system. "I don\'t put money in the banks," said Gerald, who did not give his surname. "I trust the euro as a note, but I don\'t trust banks. I don\'t want them making money out of my earnings." Digital money consultant Jon Matonis, former head forex trader at Visa, said Bitcoin was a natural fit for societies that prefer cash payments. "Try tell the Italians that they can\'t use cash any more. Try tell the Greeks!" he said. Bitcoin payments are difficult to trace back to a person\'s identity, offering an anonymity that protects users from data-mining by advertising companies, but also facilitates illicit trade and has obvious potential for money launderers. The currency gained notoriety alongside a website named Silk Road, where vendors offer to send heroin, LSD, or 9mm Beretta handguns in the post in exchange for Bitcoin. Yet there are signs Bitcoin is finding a niche among ordinary people for everyday, legitimate transactions. One British businessman in China said he regularly used it to deal with businesses in Asia, Europe and the Americas because of local restrictions on sending currency to foreign companies. "I\'ve been able to have cash in my bank account in a matter of hours using Bitcoin, rather than three days with traditional banking," he said. Quietly, a growing list of businesses are starting to accept it for a wide range of goods, from legal services to food. Matonis says it could be a perfect \u2018digital poker chip\' for online gambling and a competitive way for immigrants to send money back home. REGULATION LOOMS Bitcoin poses a puzzle for regulators. It does not fit the UK Financial Services Authority\'s definition of e-money as it is not issued on the receipt of funds, according to an FSA response to a Bitcoin business that requested to be regulated in the UK. But the creation of Bitcoin could amount to "issuing payment instruments" as long as Bitcoins in fact count as money, which is "if and when they become widely used", the FSA concluded. A spokeswoman for the German Bundesbank told Reuters it was not classifying Bitcoins as e-currency. She said EU law required only euros to be accepted as legal tender, but this was superseded by German law that allows those involved in a contract to determine its content. So Bitcoin is at least not illegal there. The situation in the United States is even more complex, where financial regulation differs from state to state. As Bitcoin is a huge distributed peer-to-peer system, any effort to enforce regulation would be difficult, though the exchanges, where Bitcoin is swapped for real-world currency, are potentially vulnerable. A legal precedent could come from France, where the biggest online exchange, Mt Gox, is in dispute with Credit Mutuel\'s Credit Industriel et Commercial. Mt Gox sued CIC after the bank closed its account. CIC said the company was illegally behaving as a financial intermediary and that using their account made the bank an accomplice, according to court documents. The court told the bank to reopen the account and compensate Mt Gox, but it was unable to determine whether Bitcoin is a virtual currency under French law and thus subject to relevant regulation. It has referred the question to another court. "If exchanges which are trying to walk the path of legality are being closed, then less law-friendly exchanges will thrive," commented Mt Gox head Mark Karpeles. "This won\'t stop Bitcoin. It may just kill any chance Bitcoin has to become a clean way of paying merchants, friends and family." Credit Mutuel declined to comment on the ongoing case. ECONOMIC ENIGMA The existence of Bitcoin is also an economic puzzle, raising questions about the definition of money itself. Its value depends on users\' belief that it is worth something. So does all money, but in the case of Bitcoin this faith could be more fragile. It also runs up against standard economic theory that people will not spend money if they expect it to increase in value; the 21 million limit means once all Bitcoins are in circulation, there are no internal inflationary pressures to devalue it. More of a threat is the tsunami of other digital forms of money that are beginning to be offered by states and companies. The Royal Canadian Mint, for example, is exploring how to issue digital currency in the future. Its chief financial officer Marc Brule said Bitcoin\'s biggest problem was that it is not backed by anything. "The system we would bring in would be backed by a fund," he told Reuters. "Bitcoin may work for the small group of people that believe in its value, but that could change very suddenly." Without that backing or a similar power base, Bitcoin lives with the ever-present risk of failure. "To be clear, I would say the same about the euro," said payment expert Lelieveldt.

It is the first time banks have come together to work on a\nshared way in which the technology that underpins bitcoin - a\ncontroversial, web-based "crytocurrency" - can be used in\nfinance. Over the past year, interest in blockchain technology has\ngrown rapidly. It has already attracted significant investment\nfrom many major banks, which reckon it could save them money by\nmaking their operations faster, more efficient and more\ntransparent. The new project, the result of more than a year\'s worth of\nconsultations between R3, the banks and other members of the\nfinancial industry, will be led by R3 CEO David Rutter, formerly\nCEO of electronic trading at ICAP Electronic Trading,\none of the world\'s largest interdealer brokers. "We held several roundtables...to deeply consider what the\npossible implications of the blockchain were, and what it could\npossibly do to save money, and time, and to create a better\nparadigm for the world of Wall Street and finance," Rutter told\nReuters on Tuesday. The other seven banks that have signed up to the initiative\nso far are JP Morgan, State Street, UBS\n, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse\n, BBVA and Commonwealth Bank of Australia\n. The blockchain works as a huge, decentralised ledger of\nevery bitcoin transaction ever made that is verified and shared\nby a global network of computers and therefore is virtually\ntamper-proof. The Bank of England has a team dedicated to it and\ncalls it a "key technological innovation". The data that can be secured using the technology is not\nrestricted to bitcoin transactions. Two parties could use it to\nexchange any other information, within minutes and with no need\nfor a third party to verify it. Rutter said the initial focus would be to agree on an\nunderlying architecture, but it had not yet been decided whether\nthat would be underpinned by bitcoin\'s blockchain or another\none, such as one being built by Ethereum, which offers more\nfeatures than the original bitcoin technology. Once that had been agreed on, Rutter said, the first use of\nthe technology might be the issuance of commercial paper on the\nblockchain. "I think that these technologies will probably be\npost-trade," he said. "I think savings are in the settlement\nside, in post-trade, in issuance, but not in exchange trading or\nOTC trading any time in the near future." He added that R3 will\nsoon announce a few more banks joining the project.

The new rules, the first by a state, create comprehensive\nguidelines for regulating digital currency firms, according to\nthe state\'s Department of Financial Services, which developed\nthe regulations. It means that digital currency companies operating in New\nYork state that hold customer funds and exchange virtual\ncurrencies for dollars or other currencies are required to apply\nfor what is known as a state "BitLicense." "There is a basic bargain that when a financial company is\nentrusted with safeguarding customer funds and receives a\nlicense from the state to do so, it accepts the need for\nheightened regulatory scrutiny to help ensure that a consumer\'s\nmoney does not just disappear into a black hole," Benjamin\nLawsky, superintendent of the New York state regulator, said in\na speech Wednesday at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in\nWashington. The "BitLicense" rules include consumer protection,\nanti-money laundering and cybersecurity protections. The regulations come as digital currencies have drawn\ncriticism for attracting drug dealers and other criminal\nelements, while failing to safeguarding consumer funds. Last year, bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox collapsed after it\nclaimed to have lost $500 million worth of customer bitcoins\nafter being hacked. Overall, industry participants said New York\'s new rules are\nstill problematic but nonetheless an improvement over the\noriginal proposals laid out in July and revised in December. Digital currency companies are required to obtain prior\napproval for material changes to their products or business\nmodels, such as wallet firms offering exchange services. They\nwould also need approval for new controlling investors. But they would not need approval from the state for every\nround of venture capital funding or standard software updates. "We have no interest in micro-managing minor app updates.\nWe\'re not Apple," said Lawsky. Companies that want both a BitLicense and a money\ntransmitter license can work with the state regulator to have a\n"one-stop" application submission to cover the requirements for\nboth. Jerry Brito, executive director of non-profit research group\nCoin Center, called the final regulations "far from perfect,"\nspecifically citing what he said were vague state-level\nanti-money laundering obligations that go beyond federal\nregulations. He said the group was working with other states "to ensure\nthey do not repeat the mistakes made here." The rules do not apply to software developers, individual\nusers, customer loyalty programs, gift cards, currency miners,\nor merchants accepting bitcoin as payment. Lawsky, meanwhile, has come under fire from the bitcoin\ncommunity for issuing the rules shortly after announcing he was\nleaving the agency to set up a consulting company that will\nadvise companies on financial matters that could possibly\ninclude digital currencies. The most prominent virtual currency now is bitcoin, often\nused as an investment or to pay for goods and services online. Bitcoin prices have been steady of late, at $225.77\n on the BitStamp platform on Wednesday. The price rose\nas high as $1,123 in December 2013. "I think (the rules) are going to increase the costs to\nentry for businesses," said New York attorney Reuben Grinberg,\nwho specializes in virtual currency. "But I think it\'s going to\ngive consumers greater peace of mind and will end up promoting\ninvestment in this area much more so than it hurts."\n\n (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Karen Freifeld;\nEditing by Chizu Nomiyama and Steve Orlofsky)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0YP1GR20150603', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 6, 3, 16, 1), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'UPDATE 2-New York regulator issues final virtual currency rules'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/11/30/waiting-for-bitcoin-to-get-boring/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' NEW YORK New York\'s top bank regulator on Tuesday revealed new plans to regulate businesses handling transactions in bitcoin this year, saying the state may issue new financial services licenses tailored to virtual currencies. Benjamin Lawsky, New York\'s financial services superintendent, raised his idea for a "BitLicense" in a hearing a day after a prominent bitcoin entrepreneur was arrested on money laundering charges. "The first job is to get rid of money laundering," said Lawsky, speaking to panelists at the hearing whose panelists included the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and the venture capitalist Fred Wilson. Officials from New York\'s Department of Financial Services asked panelists how they could best imagine businesses handling bitcoins meeting regulatory requirements equivalent to those directing other financial firms to combat money laundering and keep track of customer activity. While bitcoin experts testifying in the hearings said they agreed with the need for regulation, they warned an overly arduous system could stifle innovation and push startup companies and bitcoin transaction activity offshore. The dialogue exposed a core conflict in the relationship between regulators and bitcoin enthusiasts. When it was first created in 2009, the digital currency, which is not controlled by any company or central bank, appealed mostly to a group of tech specialists, many of whom harbored strong mistrust in governments and were looking to escape government control. The investors at Tuesday\'s hearing acknowledged activity in the bitcoin community has shifted away from this sentiment and said they wanted regulators to step in with rules for bitcoin businesses to follow. But, they said, too much regulation would damage bitcoin\'s growth. "I sympathize with Jamie Dimon," Wilson said at one emotional moment during the hearing, which he later described as a "rant." "He runs an overregulated business," Wilson said of Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co, which paid nearly $20 billion over the past year to resolve various regulatory and legal problems. "I\'m not sure I share all the sympathy," Lawsky said, adding he believed that the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 would have been more difficult to carry out if better anti-money laundering laws for financial firms had been in place. An effort similar to New York\'s to regulate virtual currencies is underway in California, according to a source familiar with a series of private meetings between bitcoin business leaders and state officials. PROMINENT ADVOCATE RESIGNS In another sign of the bitcoin community\'s push to appear more responsible, the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group, said one of its officials, Charlie Shrem, had resigned. The announcement came a day after U.S. prosecutors charged Shrem with conspiring to commit money laundering. According to prosecutors, Shrem conspired to sell more than $1 million in bitcoins to users of Silk Road, an illicit online drugs bazaar that authorities shuttered last year. Shrem was CEO of BitInstant, a bitcoin exchange company that closed last summer. Lawsky said Shrem\'s arrest cast a cloud over the industry, but that virtual currencies could benefit the financial system. "It could force the traditional payments community to \'up its game\' in terms of the speed, affordability and reliability of financial transactions," Lawsky said. Lawsky said that while he wanted to set up clear rules, he also wanted to preserve flexibility, given the constantly evolving nature of the technology. "That is, in part, why we\'re evaluating whether our agency should issue a so-called \'BitLicense\' specifically tailored to virtual currencies," he said.

"The first job is to get rid of money laundering," said\nLawsky, speaking to panelists at the hearing whose panelists\nincluded the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and the\nventure capitalist Fred Wilson. Officials from New York\'s Department of Financial Services\nasked panelists how they could best imagine businesses handling\nbitcoins meeting regulatory requirements equivalent to those\ndirecting other financial firms to combat money laundering and\nkeep track of customer activity. While bitcoin experts testifying in the hearings said they\nagreed with the need for regulation, they warned an overly\narduous system could stifle innovation and push startup\ncompanies and bitcoin transaction activity offshore. The dialogue exposed a core conflict in the relationship\nbetween regulators and bitcoin enthusiasts. When it was first\ncreated in 2009, the digital currency, which is not controlled\nby any company or central bank, appealed mostly to a group of\ntech specialists, many of whom harbored strong mistrust in\ngovernments and were looking to escape government control. The investors at Tuesday\'s hearing acknowledged activity in\nthe bitcoin community has shifted away from this sentiment and\nsaid they wanted regulators to step in with rules for bitcoin\nbusinesses to follow. But, they said, too much regulation would\ndamage bitcoin\'s growth. "I sympathize with Jamie Dimon," Wilson said at one\nemotional moment during the hearing, which he later described as\na "rant." "He runs an overregulated business," Wilson said of Dimon,\nchief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co, which paid nearly $20\nbillion over the past year to resolve various regulatory and\nlegal problems. "I\'m not sure I share all the sympathy," Lawsky said, adding\nhe believed that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 would\nhave been more difficult to carry out if better anti-money\nlaundering laws for financial firms had been in place. An effort similar to New York\'s to regulate virtual\ncurrencies is underway in California, according to a source\nfamiliar with a series of private meetings between bitcoin\nbusiness leaders and state officials.  PROMINENT ADVOCATE RESIGNS In another sign of the bitcoin community\'s push to appear\nmore responsible, the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group, \nsaid one of its officials, Charlie Shrem, had resigned. The\nannouncement came a day after U.S. prosecutors charged Shrem\nwith conspiring to commit money laundering. According to prosecutors, Shrem conspired to sell more than\n$1 million in bitcoins to users of Silk Road, an illicit online\ndrugs bazaar that authorities shuttered last year. Shrem was CEO\nof BitInstant, a bitcoin exchange company that closed last\nsummer. Lawsky said Shrem\'s arrest cast a cloud over the industry,\nbut that virtual currencies could benefit the financial system. "It could force the traditional payments community to \'up\nits game\' in terms of the speed, affordability and reliability\nof financial transactions," Lawsky said. Lawsky said that while he wanted to set up clear rules, he\nalso wanted to preserve flexibility, given the constantly\nevolving nature of the technology. "That is, in part, why we\'re evaluating whether our agency\nshould issue a so-called \'BitLicense\' specifically tailored to\nvirtual currencies," he said.', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0L211420140128', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 28, 17, 37), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'UPDATE 3-New York may offer virtual currency regulations this year'}, {'articleText': u' (Clarifies Richard Gendal Brown\'s title to show he is chief\ntechnology officer in para 6) By Jemima Kelly LONDON Nov 19 Five more banks have joined a\nglobal consortium working on ways blockchain technology can be\nused in financial markets, the firm leading the project said on\nThursday, as it brought in experts from the worlds of banking\nand technology.

The Senate committee recommendations, included in a report to be tabled in parliament next week and obtained in advance by Reuters, underscore governments\' growing acceptance of the role of so-called "cryptocurrencies" around the world. If implemented, the changes would align Australia with the United Kingdom and Spain by having people pay sales tax just once if they buy something with bitcoin, while leaving other nations like Sweden to fret over its true legal status. The changes would also match Australia with Canada and Singapore, which have in the past 18 months changed their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws to apply to digital currency and traditional currency equally. Treating bitcoin as a tradable commodity, rather than a currency, "creates a double taxation effect that has placed an additional burden on Australian digital currency businesses," the Senate report says, noting that Australians pay sales tax when they buy digital currency and again when they buy something with the digital currency. "Digital currency should be treated as money for the purposes of the goods and services tax," the report adds. It notes that all eight state governments and the Federal government must agree to any change to the country\'s sales tax. The report meanwhile calls for Australia to change its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws to include all digital currencies. It notes that the laws as written a decade ago apply only to digital currencies "backed by a precious metal or bullion", and not to the most popular digital currency, bitcoin. Seven percent of the world\'s $5 billion worth of supply of bitcoin is in circulation in Australia. The change would force all digital currency companies to register with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center and run due diligence on customers, enabling "businesses to better identify and mitigate money laundering and terrorism financing risks in the conduct of their transactions". Digital currencies are creating just part of a broader headache for governments as they scramble to re-set their regulatory systems to cope with internet-driven disruptive technology. Online ride-share service Uber has filed a lawsuit against the Australian government claiming it should not have to pay sales tax. The government is yet to file a response.

Gox have turned to internet sleuthing to find out where their money has gone - but they\'re unlikely to have much luck. That\'s because the crypto-currency is a lot more complex than it looks, even to those who believed in it enough to invest their savings, bitcoin experts say, illustrating the scale of the challenge facing investigators trying to unravel the multi-million dollar mess at what was once the world\'s dominant bitcoin exchange. Forum websites like Reddit and internet relay chatrooms have attracted hordes of users as the Mt. Gox debacle unfolded in recent weeks. But their crowdsourcing investigations have uncovered little in the way of real evidence about what happened. "The crowdsourcing so far has been a miserable failure," said Emin Gun Sirer of Cornell University, who posted his own analysis challenging several theories about what may have happened at Mt. Gox. The problem, Gun Sirer and others say, is two-fold: users of such forums are not always methodical or disciplined in their research on one hand, and on the other, bitcoin\'s combination of transparency and complexity invites the unwary to draw false conclusions. Mark Karpeles, the 28-year-old French CEO of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, filed for bankruptcy on Friday admitting that some 850,000 bitcoins - worth more than $560 million at today\'s prices, and about 7 percent of all bitcoins minted - were missing. Karpeles blamed hackers for the theft, based on a so-called "malleability" bug in bitcoin software. BLINKING The collapse of Mt. Gox has left thousands of bitcoin users bereft. Driven in part by a desire to find the missing bitcoins, and in the absence of any solid explanation by Mt. Gox or Karpeles, Reddit users and others have shared links, studied bitcoin transactions and traded rumors online. One forum, mtgox-chat, has become the starting point of much of the digging, so much so that a user claiming to be Serbian chose it to first share links to files apparently stolen from Mt. Gox\'s own servers, including computer code and what appeared to be a tape recording of a conversation between Karpeles and Japanese bankers in late January. Some of the research, however, has been less useful. One user on Reddit, for example, suggested that Karpeles had been blinking a hidden message in morse code during a press conference in Tokyo last Friday, prompting some to replay the video frame by frame to try to divine the message. Other efforts have been more serious, and borne fruit. A European in his late 20s who works in the legal profession and goes by the name of Aquentin ONLINE traced the movement of some of the bitcoin Karpeles had moved from one wallet to another back in 2011 as proof that Mt. Gox was insolvent. His research, he said in an email interview, showed that these coins were among up to 200,000 moved again recently, in late December and in early February - indicating that not only were there bitcoins still somewhere in the system, but that they seemed to belong to Mt. Gox. Aquentin\'s research was followed up by others, among them a PhD student in the UK who calls himself Oakpacific. Both declined to give their names or other identifying information. Their conclusion: the movement of coins they investigated did not square with the explanation given by Mt. Gox that the exchange lost its coins to a malleability attack. Says Aquentin of their findings: "They show that at the very least we have not been told the whole truth." Their conclusions have been, at least in part, backed up by more established figures. Ken Shirriff, a software engineer at Google who runs a blog at righto.com, analyzed transactions in early February on Mt. Gox and raised questions about the company\'s claims that it had come under attack prior to February 7. Shirriff was cautious in his conclusions, but he said in a blog post that the malleability attack he looked into could not have been responsible for Mt. Gox\'s problems at that time. Shirriff declined to be interviewed for this article. IODINE Indeed there are, potentially, rich pickings to be had from such research. Because the transaction history of bitcoins is public, says Italian computer security researcher Stefano Zanero, it\'s possible for anyone to investigate. Moreover, if a bitcoin owner is not careful in detaching the keys - his PIN number - from anything that may identify him, he would effectively remove anonymity from a transaction. But researching this is not easy, he warns. Zanero has with colleagues from Italy\'s Politecnico di Milano developed software called BitIodine which studies bitcoin transactions to cluster addresses likely to belong to the same user, or group of users. BitIodine will be demonstrated at a financial cryptography conference in Barbados this week. But he warns that even BitIodine only supports, but doesn\'t replace, any traditional investigative techniques - as well as requiring a lot of computing power and memory, not to mention analysts skilled enough to make sense of it. "It\'s no silver bullet," he said in an email interview. TOO MUCH INFORMATION Indeed the problem with tracing bitcoins is almost too much information. Bitcoin\'s ledger, called the blockchain, that records all transactions, makes public a chunk of information that would normally require many subpoenas to extract, Gun Sirer says. "So that\'s fantastic, but it\'s the perfect set-up for armchair experts to end up getting in over their heads," he said. The danger arises when drawing links and patterns between wallets and transactions that are spurious, he says. From there to implicating unrelated people is a short and dangerous step. Gun Sirer points to a paper by Israeli academics Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir published in November which inferred a relationship between Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous \'founder\' of bitcoin, and the creator of Silk Road, a website for trading drugs. Silk Road was shut down by the FBI last October. Its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht, has pleaded not guilty to charges including money laundering. The paper was withdrawn after a cryptographer called Dustin Trammell said he owned the bitcoin address the researchers had uncovered. "The crowds are capable of making far worse mistakes with bigger consequences," said Gun Sirer. Indeed, Reddit is still smarting from last year, when its users misidentified two young men as suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings. Reddit later apologized for fuelling "online witchhunts and dangerous speculation." LESSONS Some users say the lessons from that episode have only been partly learned. An Oklahoma-based soft drinks distributor called Michael Bennett dug up what he said were 29 wallets containing about 690,000 bitcoins traded heavily in the weeks leading up to February 24. But when he posted his findings on Reddit he found little interest in following up or joining him in doing more research. "It\'s really showed just how poor the community is," he said in an online interview. "People just look for the juiciest leads, they want drama, they want excitement." Emma, a 20-something female based in the United States, who frequents the mtgox-chat channel, says that in some ways it\'s understandable. She has 120 bitcoins stuck in Mt. Gox, which she had been buying since 2011. At current prices, that sum would pay off all her debts and allow her to go to college, she said. Many of those in the chatroom, she said in an online interview, are simply struggling to find even the basic pieces of the puzzle, while at the same time smarting from having lost their savings.

On Tuesday, authorities in Spain, Costa Rica and New York arrested five people at the digital currency firm Liberty Reserve, including its founder Arthur Budovsky, and seized related bank accounts and Internet domains. It was a further wake-up call for those involved in digital currencies, such as the most prominent, Bitcoin, that they need to comply with anti-money laundering rules or risk facing a crackdown. They had already been put on notice - first by an April 2012 report from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that explained how Bitcoin was being used by criminals to secretly transfer money around the world, and then this March by the U.S. Treasury Department. Its anti-money laundering arm, the Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stated that digital currency firms needed to comply with the same anti-money laundering rules as other financial institutions, including monitoring customers and reporting suspicious activity to the government. As regulators tighten the screws, businesses built around digital currencies are trying to satisfy new monitoring requirements without letting public enthusiasm for the technology-based concept slip away. "I think the whole ecosystem is maturing very quickly and we have young companies that are just beginning to understand how to navigate the regulatory issues," said David A. Johnston, co-founder and executive director of BitAngels, a new venture which only this week announced it had raised $6.7 million to fund startups tied to Bitcoin. Digital currency is electronic money that can be passed between individuals without the use of the traditional banking or money transfer system. Different currencies are structured in different ways. Some, like Liberty Reserve\'s "LR" digital currency, use units of value that are tied to an existing hard currency, such as the U.S. dollar. By contrast, the value of Bitcoin, the best known virtual currency, fluctuates according to supply and demand. Bitcoin, which has been embraced by a number of venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, exists through an open-source software program that any users with enough skill and computing power can access. It is not managed by a single company or government. Users can buy bitcoins through exchanges that convert real money into the virtual currency. Liberty Reserve, which was closed last week, however, was a firm that U.S. prosecutors said created a platform that enabled criminal gangs to launder more than $6 billion. Bitcoin\'s supporters cite a host of legitimate reasons for using a digital currency: It can be transferred using less infrastructure than traditional currencies, and with fewer service fees. A virtual currency could also be safer than using a regular credit card for online purchases, because it is not attached directly to any bank account. But law enforcement officials see Bitcoin as another vehicle for criminals to anonymously transfer money. FinCEN\'s statement in March set off a rush inside the community to learn about anti-money laundering rules and figure out how to comply with them. At the 2013 Bitcoin Conference in San Jose, California two weeks ago, discussion focused heavily on regulatory compliance - its intricacies and its costs. "That was a big theme of the whole conference," said Jerry Brito, director of the technology policy program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Brito said businesses exchanging Bitcoins were coming to terms with the fact that they would now need to get licensed as money transmitters in 48 U.S. states, a process requiring in-person interviews in each state, thanks to FinCEN\'s guidance. "Everything I\'m telling you, I\'ve learned over the past couple of months as I\'m racing to learn," said Brito, who attended the Bitcoin Conference in San Jose. "I think that\'s what the Bitcoin community is doing too." Charlie Shrem, chief executive of Bitcoin transfer firm BitInstant.com, told the conference about the importance of complying with the new rules. "You have to know your customer," he told the audience, according to a video posted on the Internet. "Whether or not you agree with the laws or not, you\'ve got to follow them." The FinCEN statement means companies that exchange Bitcoins for hard currency must now hire full-time compliance officers to verify the identities of users, especially those looking to transfer Bitcoins out of the digital world and back into dollars or other hard currencies. Estimates vary on how much it costs to get compliant, but licensing and registration fees alone can total in the tens of thousands of dollars, an added heavy cost for small startup businesses. Brito said the Bitcoin community is also trying to increase its contact with law enforcement and regulators. The Bitcoin Foundation, a Bitcoin advocacy group made up of Bitcoin-related business owners and software programmers, is looking to hire a full-time lawyer based in Washington to make its case to regulators and lawmakers. Some members of the community are declining to discuss regulation. Jon Matonis, the Bitcoin Foundation\'s secretary who is identified on the group\'s website as one of two spokesmen for press inquiries, told Reuters: "I am electing to take a brief break from commenting on issues such as this." U.S. law enforcement officials are looking first and foremost to unmask criminals operating in cyberspace and arrest them, wherever they may be in the world, and they\'re looking to digital currency businesses to help. Ed Lowery, special agent in charge of the U.S. Secret Service\'s criminal investigative division, said the agency is working "aggressively with our international partners" to pursue cyber crime and the companies that permit the misuse of digital currencies. He declined to comment specifically on Bitcoin. Liberty Reserve has not been the only recent target for the authorities. The Tokyo-based firm Mt. Gox, the world\'s largest exchanger of U.S. dollars with Bitcoins, had two accounts held by its U.S. subsidiary seized this month by agents from the Department of Homeland Security on the grounds that it was operating a money transmitting business without a license. Mt. Gox on Thursday announced it would require all of its users accounts to be verified before allowing them to perform any more deposits or withdrawals. Its founder declined to comment for this story. Other companies are simply trying to avoid having to comply with U.S. rules by keeping away from the country. Following FinCEN\'s statement, two digital currency firms structured similarly to Liberty Reserve - Russia-based WebMoney and Panama-based Perfect Money - restricted access to their services from inside the United States. Vyacheslav Andryushchenko, a spokesman for WebMoney in Russia, said each of the company\'s 20 million users had to agree to prohibitions against money laundering and illegal trade when signing up for an account. Users who violate the rules are cut off, and all actions inside WebMoney\'s system are recorded, the spokesman said. A user is blocked if there are any suspicions of anything illegal. In addition, the less personal information the user provides, the fewer services are available to him or her, the spokesman said. Several messages on the listed number on Perfect Money\'s website were not returned. The company\'s address is an empty suite in an office block on the northwestern side of Panama City. A secretary in a neighboring office said she had never seen anyone go in or out.

Blockchain technology - or distributed ledger technology, as\nmany financiers prefer to call it - is what underpins bitcoin\n, a controversial web-based "cryptocurrency". It is a massive ledger of every bitcoin transaction made\nthat is verified and shared by a global network of computers. However, the data that can be secured by the blockchain is\nnot restricted to bitcoin transactions. Any two parties could\nuse it to exchange other information, including stock deals,\nlegal contracts and property records, within minutes and with no\nneed for a central authority to verify it. Basel-based BIS\'s Committee on Payments and Market\nInfrastructure (CPMI), made up of central bankers from across\nthe world, said it could challenge banks\' role - but if the\ntechnology became widespread it was unclear who would then\nprovide credit and savings facilities. Banks reckon the technology could save them money by making\ntheir operations faster, more efficient and more transparent and\nare investing large sums of money in the initiative. "Digital currencies and distributed ledgers are innovations\nthat could have an impact on many areas, not only on payment\nsystems and services," said Benoit Coeure, the committee\'s chair\nand a member of the European Central Bank\'s Executive Board. "Even if today\'s schemes do not endure in their present\nform, it is likely that other products, services and business\nmodels based on the same underlying technology will continue to\nemerge and develop. This might lead to changes in the way that\nFMIs (financial market infrastructures) and other market\nparticipants operate." The report said blockchain technology could present a\n"hypothetical challenge" to central banks too, because it\nreduced the need for a central body. The CPMI also said the nature of the technology meant it did\nnot fit easily into existing regulatory frameworks, and that the\nborderless nature of digital currencies posed a particular\nchallenge to regulators. Last week the European Union said it would increase controls\non bitcoin in a bid to curb terrorism funding, following attacks\nin Paris that killed 130 people.

LOUIS May 31 These are unsettling\ntimes for digital currency businesses and the venture\ncapitalists backing them. On Tuesday, the authorities in Spain, Costa Rica and New\nYork arrested five people at the digital currency firm Liberty\nReserve, including its founder Arthur Budovsky, and seized\nrelated bank accounts and Internet domains. It was a further wake-up call for those involved in digital\ncurrencies, such as the most prominent, Bitcoin, that they need\nto comply with anti-money laundering rules or risk facing a\ncrackdown. They had already been put on notice - first by an April 2012\nreport from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that\nexplained how Bitcoin was being used by criminals to secretly\ntransfer money around the world, and then this March by the U.S.\nTreasury Department. Its anti-money laundering arm, the\nFinancial Crimes and Enforcement Network (FinCEN) stated that\ndigital currency firms needed to comply with the same anti-money\nlaundering rules as other financial institutions, including\nmonitoring customers and reporting suspicious activity to the\ngovernment. As regulators tighten the screws, businesses built around\ndigital currencies are trying to satisfy new monitoring\nrequirements without letting public enthusiasm for the\ntechnology-based concept slip away. "I think the whole ecosystem is maturing very quickly and we\nhave young companies that are just beginning to understand how\nto navigate the regulatory issues," said David A. Johnston,\nco-founder and executive director of BitAngels, a new venture\nwhich only this week announced it had raised $6.7 million to\nfund startups tied to Bitcoin. Digital currency is electronic money that can be passed\nbetween individuals without the use of the traditional banking\nor money transfer system. Different currencies are structured in different ways.  \nSome, like Liberty Reserve\'s "LR" digital currency, use units of\nvalue that are tied to an existing hard currency, such as the\nU.S. dollar. By contrast, the value of Bitcoin, the best known\nvirtual currency, fluctuates according to supply and demand. Bitcoin, which has been embraced by a number of venture\ncapitalists in Silicon Valley, exists through an open-source\nsoftware program that any users with enough skill and computing\npower can access. It is not managed by a single company or\ngovernment. Users can buy bitcoins through exchanges that\nconvert real money into the virtual currency. Liberty Reserve, which was closed last week, however, was a\nfirm that U.S. prosecutors said created a platform that enabled\ncriminal gangs to launder more than $6 billion. Bitcoin\'s supporters cite a host of legitimate reasons for\nusing a digital currency: It can be transferred using less\ninfrastructure than traditional currencies, and with fewer\nservice fees. A virtual currency could also be safer than using\na regular credit card for online purchases, because it is not\nattached directly to any bank account. But law enforcement officials see Bitcoin as another vehicle\nfor criminals to anonymously transfer money. FinCEN\'s statement in March set off a rush inside the\ncommunity to learn about anti-money laundering rules and figure\nout how to comply with them. At the 2013 Bitcoin Conference in\nSan Jose, California two weeks ago, discussion focused heavily\non regulatory compliance - its intricacies and its costs. "That was a big theme of the whole conference," said Jerry\nBrito, director of the technology policy program at the Mercatus\nCenter at George Mason University. Brito said businesses\nexchanging Bitcoins were coming to terms with the fact that they\nwould now need to get licensed as money transmitters in 48 U.S.\nstates, a process requiring in-person interviews in each state,\nthanks to FinCEN\'s guidance. "Everything I\'m telling you, I\'ve learned over the past\ncouple of months as I\'m racing to learn," said Brito, who\nattended the Bitcoin Conference in San Jose. "I think that\'s\nwhat the Bitcoin community is doing too." Charlie Shrem, chief executive of Bitcoin transfer firm\nBitInstant.com, told the conference about the importance of\ncomplying with the new rules. "You have to know your customer," he told the audience,\naccording to a video posted on the Internet. "Whether or not you\nagree with the laws or not, you\'ve got to follow them." The FinCEN statement means companies that exchange Bitcoins\nfor hard currency must now hire full-time compliance officers to\nverify the identities of users, especially those looking to\ntransfer Bitcoins out of the digital world and back into dollars\nor other hard currencies. Estimates vary on how much it costs to\nget compliant, but licensing and registration fees alone can\ntotal in the tens of thousands of dollars, an added heavy cost\nfor small startup businesses. Brito said the Bitcoin community is also trying to increase\nits contact with law enforcement and regulators. The Bitcoin\nFoundation, a Bitcoin advocacy group made up of Bitcoin-related\nbusiness owners and software programmers, is looking to hire a\nfull-time lawyer based in Washington to make its case to\nregulators and lawmakers. Some members of the community are declining to discuss\nregulation. Jon Matonis, the Bitcoin Foundation\'s secretary who\nis identified on the group\'s website as one of two spokesmen for\npress inquiries, told Reuters: "I am electing to take a brief\nbreak from commenting on issues such as this." U.S. law enforcement officials are looking first and\nforemost to unmask criminals operating in cyberspace and arrest\nthem, wherever they may be in the world, and they\'re looking to\ndigital currency businesses to help. Ed Lowery, special agent in charge of the U.S. Secret\nService\'s criminal investigative division, said the agency is\nworking "aggressively with our international partners" to pursue\ncyber crime and the companies that permit the misuse of digital\ncurrencies. He declined to comment specifically on Bitcoin. Liberty Reserve has not been the only recent target for the\nauthorities. The Tokyo-based firm Mt. Gox, the world\'s largest\nexchanger of U.S. dollars with Bitcoins, had two accounts held\nby its U.S. subsidiary seized this month by agents from the\nDepartment of Homeland Security on the grounds that it was\noperating a money transmitting business without a license. Mt. Gox on Thursday announced it would require all of its\nusers accounts to be verified before allowing them to perform\nany more deposits or withdrawals. Its founder declined to\ncomment for this story. Other companies are simply trying to avoid having to comply\nwith U.S. rules by keeping away from the country. Following\nFinCEN\'s statement, two digital currency firms structured\nsimilarly to Liberty Reserve - Russia-based WebMoney and\nPanama-based Perfect Money - restricted access to their services\nfrom inside the United States.

The financial industry is increasingly investing in the\ntechnology, betting it will reduce costs and increase\nefficiency. Blockchain technology is not limited to bitcoin -- it can be\nused to secure and validate the exchange of any data. And other\ncompanies are now building their own blockchains that provide\nadditional features to the original bitcoin one. One such company is Ethereum, which has built a fully\nprogrammeable blockchain. Technology giant Microsoft is using it\nfor the blockchain platform launched on Tuesday. The platform will be available to banks and insurance\ncompanies that are already using Microsoft\'s cloud-based Azure\nplatform. Microsoft said four large global financial\ninstitutions had already signed up to the service. "Working with our customers that wanted to start playing\naround with blockchain technology, the major pain point that we\nkept hearing from them was that it was just too hard to get\nstarted, and too expensive," Microsoft\'s director of tech\nstrategy for financial services, Marley Gray, told Reuters on\nthe sidelines of Ethereum\'s "DevCon" conference in London. Gray described the platform as providing a "fail fast, fail\ncheap" model for firms: they can experiment with the cloud-based\ntechnology using templates provided by Microsoft without having\nto build their own systems.

Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of financial services for\nthe state of New York, said the new digital currency rules known\nas the "BitLicense" will focus on overseeing financial\nintermediaries only. "There is a basic bargain that when a financial company is\nentrusted with safeguarding customer funds and receives a\nlicense from the state to do so - it accepts the need for\nheightened regulatory scrutiny to help ensure that a consumer\'s\nmoney does not just disappear into a black hole," Lawsky said \nat the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington. The new rules would not apply to software developers,\nindividual users, customer loyalty programs, gift cards,\ncurrency miners, or merchants accepting it as payment. Digital currency companies would not need prior approval\nfrom the state for updates on their software, only for material\nchanges such as a wallet firm offering exchange services. "We have no interest in micro-managing minor app updates.\nWe\'re not Apple," said Lawsky. Industry participants have feared BitLicenses will hamper\nstart-ups and require too many approvals as businesses grow. The "BitLicense" plan is the first set of rules by a state\nto create guidelines specifically for virtual currencies. It\nincludes rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money\nlaundering, and cybersecurity. Lawsky, meanwhile, has come under fire from the bitcoin\ncommunity for issuing the rules shortly after announcing he was\nleaving the agency to set up his own consulting company on\ndigital currencies. The most prominent virtual currency now is bitcoin, often\nused as an investment or to pay for goods and services online. Bitcoin prices have been steady of late, trading at $225.77\n on the BitStamp platform on Wednesday. It rose as\nhigh as $1,123 in December 2013. The rules met resistance from industry participants who\nclaim they will stifle innovation, while others hope the\nregulation will help legitimize bitcoin. "There are going to be gray areas," said New York attorney\nReuben Grinberg, who specializes in virtual currency. "I think\nwhat you\'re going to see over the next year or two are requests\nfor clarification.

Trustwave said on Monday that it has found evidence that the operators of a cybercrime ring known as the Pony botnet have stolen some 85 virtual "wallets" that contained bitcoins and other types of digital currencies. The firm said it did not know how much digital currency was contained in the wallets. "It is the first time we saw such a widespread presence of this type of malware. It was on hundreds of thousands of machines," said Ziv Mador, security research director with Chicago-based Trustwave. Trustwave said it believes the crime ring is still operating, though it does not know who is running the group. The company said it has disrupted the servers that were controlling machines infected with Pony, but expects the group to launch more attacks on virtual currency users. A representative for the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group that promotes adoption of the virtual currency, advised bitcoin users to store their currency offline in a secure location to prevent cyber criminals from stealing them. "Electronic wallet security continues to improve by leaps and bounds as hardware wallets become available and we start to see software wallets that support multi-signature transactions," said the Bitcoin Foundation\'s director of public affairs, Jinyoung Lee Englund. Trustwave\'s discovery comes after an unrelated cyber attack that spammed bitcoin exchanges earlier this month. That attack prompted at least three online virtual currency traders to halt withdrawals, causing bitcoin\'s value to plunge 33 percent over three weeks. Bitcoin is a digital currency sustained by software code written by an unknown programmer or group of programmers. It is not governed by any one company or person, and its value is determined by user demand. People who buy digital currency can store it in virtual wallets on their own machines or with companies that offer storage and security services. Mador said digital currency theft is still in its infancy, but that it is likely to grow. He said that digital currency buyers can protect themselves from hackers by using encrypted files. "Most websites don\'t encrypt them by default, but you can turn them on," he added. NEW OPPORTUNITY Botnets are collections of infected computers that take orders from central "command and control" servers. The botnets steal data from compromised PCs and can also deliver other types of malware that force them to perform tasks. This is at least the third type of fraud to surface involving digital currencies. Criminals have previously hacked into marketplaces where digital currencies are traded by exploiting security flaws in those sites, then stealing those currencies, according to Trustwave. (bit.ly/1hphzRj) Cyber criminals have also developed botnets that force enslaved computers to create, or "mine", digital currencies, which the fraudsters then claim as their own. Bitcoin mining is a time-consuming process in which computers perform complex math calculations. The operators of those botnets are stealing electricity and data center resources when they use compromised machines to mine digital currencies. Trustwave in December uncovered a trove of some 2 million stolen passwords to websites including Facebook Inc, Google Inc, Twitter Inc and Yahoo Inc while probing a command and control server using a less sophisticated version of the Pony malware. Trustwave said on Monday that the new version of Pony compromised another 600,000 website credentials.

The company intends to digitize all of the fiat currencies found in the Caribbean and place them on the blockchain so they can be easily traded among the islands, bringing modern solutions to a region historically limited by an inefficient exchange and settlement systems, the Overstock statement said. Overstock has been one of the earliest advocates of digital currencies. It was the first U.S. company with annual sales of at least $1 billion to accept bitcoins as a mode of payment.

The memo comes after federal authorities have filed claims against other digital currency businesses. Last year, the FBI reported Bitcoin was being used by criminals to move money around the world. Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, said in the memo that his department is concerned that virtual currency exchangers are violating current New York regulations for money transmitters, which require posting collateral and periodic examinations. He warned in the memo that "serving as a money changer of choice for terrorists, drug smugglers, illegal weapons dealers, money launderers, and human traffickers could expose the virtual currency industry to extraordinarily serious of (sic) criminal penalties." Lawsky said the department also is considering new regulations specifically for the emerging currency products. "If virtual currencies remain a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country\'s national security, but also the very existence of the virtual currency industry," Lawsky wrote. Digital currency is electronic money that can be passed between parties without traditional banking or money transfer systems. Bitcoin is the most prominent one, having been embraced by a number of venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. As part of its inquiry, the department issued subpoenas to 22 companies associated with virtual currencies last week, according to a person familiar with the probe. The subpoenas seek information on anti-money laundering controls, consumer protection measures, and investment strategies in virtual currencies, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly and did not want to be identified. BitInstant, BitPay and Dwolla are among the companies subpoenaed, the person said. None returned phone calls or emails seeking comment. Jaron Lukasiewicz, chief executive officer of New York-based Coinsetter, declined to comment on the subpoena his company received, but did say in an email, "Although it may not be apparent from the outside, the leading Bitcoin companies are taking regulation and compliance very seriously." Subpoenas also went to firms backed by investors in virtual currencies, including Andreessen Horowitz, founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the Founders Fund, which includes Peter Thiel and Sean Parker, and Winklevoss Capital Management, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the person said. Through a spokeswoman, the Winklevosses declined comment. Last month, they said they planned an initial public offering that would give investors exposure to the value of Bitcoin. Neither Andreessen Horowitz nor the Founders Fund responded to requests for comment. Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group of Bitcoin-related businesses, said it would engage "with regulators in New York" and wherever else was needed and provide legal defense when appropriate. Bitcoin exists through an open-source software program and is not managed by a single company or government. Its users can buy Bitcoins through exchanges that convert real money into the virtual currency. The U.S. Treasury Department in March said digital currency firms were required to abide by anti-money laundering regulations, including monitoring customers and reporting suspicious activity. Last week, a federal judge in Texas allowed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to proceed with its case against a Texas man accused of running a Ponzi scheme with Bitcoin.

Gox said on Friday it found 200,000\n"forgotten" bitcoins on March 7, a week after the Tokyo-based\ndigital currency exchange filed for bankruptcy protection,\nsaying it lost nearly all the 850,000 bitcoins it held, worth\nsome $500 million at today\'s prices. Mt. Gox made the announcement on its website. Online sleuths\nhad noticed around 200,000 bitcoins moving through the\ncrypto-currency exchange after the bankruptcy filing. The exchange, headed by 28-year-old Frenchman Mark Karpeles,\nsaid the bitcoins were found in an old-format online wallet\nwhich it had thought no longer held any bitcoins, but which it\nchecked again after its bankruptcy filing. "On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old\nformat wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance\nof approximately 200,000 BTC," the statement said. It added that "for security reasons" it moved the 200,000\nbitcoins from online to offline wallets on March 14-15. "These bitcoin movements, including the change in the manner\nin which these coins were stored, had been reported to the court\nand the supervisor by counsels," Mt. Gox said. A lawyer representing the plaintiffs in a class action suit\nagainst the shuttered exchange disputed the claim that the\nbitcoins had been "forgotten" in a dormant wallet. Many of Mt. Gox\'s 127,000 creditors, who feared they had\nlost their investments when the exchange filed for bankruptcy, \nare skeptical about what the exchange has said happened to the\nbitcoins it had. In its bankruptcy filing, Mt. Gox also said $28\nmillion was "missing" from its Japanese bank accounts.    BITCOIN TRACKING On Thursday, a U.S. judge in Chicago overseeing a class\naction against Mt. Gox revised a previous order, allowing some\nof the exchange\'s bitcoin movements to be tracked. "Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the\n180,000 bitcoins, which we\'ve been monitoring. Hours later, Mt.\nGox claimed it \'found\' these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox\nrealized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned\nthese 180,000-200,000 bitcoins," Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at\nlaw firm Edelson, told Reuters in emailed comments. Edelson is representing Illinois resident Gregory Greene,\nwho proposed the class action over what he claims is a massive\nfraud. Mt. Gox blamed the loss of 750,000 bitcoins belonging to\nits customers and 100,000 of its own on hackers who attacked its\nsoftware. Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network\nindependent of central control. Its value soared last year, and\nthe total worth of bitcoins is now about $7 billion.  BLOCKCHAIN EVIDENCE In an interview on Friday, Woodrow said the claim that the\nnewly discovered bitcoins had been in a long-dormant wallet was\nfalse, citing publicly visible information about the contents of\nMt. Gox\'s bitcoin wallets, which can be viewed on the internet. "The idea that there were 200,000 or 180,000 bitcoins in a\nsingle wallet that they just discovered which had been dormant\nfor years that contained 180,000 bitcoins is undercut by plain\nevidence on the blockchain," Woodrow said. The blockchain is a public ledger recording every movement\nof each bitcoin in existence. Entries to the blockchain are made\nautomatically, as part of Bitcoin\'s software. "On March 7th there\'s a transaction where \ntransferred batches of bitcoins containing 40,000 and 50,000\neach into a single address holding the 180,000." Karpeles\' lawyers did not immediately respond to a request\nfor comment. Woodrow said the blockchain showed the 180,000 bitcoins were\ndistributed in batches of 50 bitcoins each to separate wallets\nover a period of four days starting March 7. "At no point was the bankruptcy Court in Dallas notified of\nthis at all, despite Mr. Karpeles supposedly informing his\nlawyers about it on March 8th and Mt. Gox seeking Chapter 15\nprotection on the 10th," Woodrow said. \n\n (Additional reporting by Tom Hals in Delaware and Emily Flitter\nin New York; Editing by Tom Brown)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0MI1HN20140321', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 21, 16, 30), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"UPDATE 1-Mt.

"General tax principles that apply to property transactions\napply to transactions using virtual currency," the IRS said in a\nstatement, meaning that bitcoins would be taxed as ordinary\nincome or as assets subject to capital gains taxes, depending on\nthe circumstance. Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, started\ncirculating in 2009. Its present market value is around $8\nbillion, with up to 80,000 transactions occurring daily,\naccording to accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Recent incidents have brought the currency under new\nregulatory scrutiny, such as the failure of Mt. Gox, a\nTokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy after losing an\nestimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins. Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers\nand is independent of control or backing by any government or\ncentral bank, which its proponents like, but which also has led\nto calls for more guidance on U.S. tax treatment. The IRS supplied that in its statement, which dealt a blow\nto bitcoin "miners," who unlock new bitcoins online. The IRS\nsaid miners must include the fair market value of the virtual\ncurrency as gross income on the date of receipt. This change "is a disincentive to start looking for\nbitcoins," said John Barrie, a partner with law firm Bryan Cave\nLLP, who advises charities that receive bitcoins as donations.  NOT LEGAL TENDER The IRS also said that virtual currency is not to be treated\nas legal-tender currency to determine if a transaction causes a\nforeign currency gain or loss under U.S. tax law. For other forms of gains or losses involving virtual\ncurrency, the IRS explained how to determine the U.S. dollar\nvalue of virtual currency and said taxable gains or losses can\nbe incurred in related property transactions. "The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of\nvirtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a\ncapital asset in the hands of the taxpayer," the IRS said. If a taxpayer holds virtual currency as capital - like\nstocks or bonds or other investment property - gains or losses\nare realized as capital gains or losses, the agency said. However, when virtual currency is held as inventory or other\nproperty mainly for sale to customers in a trade or business,\nordinary gains or losses are generally incurred, the IRS said. Capital gains and losses are taxable and deductible at\ndifferent rates and amounts than ordinary gains and losses. Democratic Senator Tom Carper, who chaired a Senate\ncommittee hearing last year on bitcoin, said in a statement that\nthe IRS guidance "provides clarity for taxpayers who want to\nensure that they\'re doing the right thing and playing by the\nrules when utilizing bitcoin and other digital currencies."  MINERS HURT New bitcoins come from a process called mining. Computer\nprogrammers around the world compete to crack an automatically\ngenerated code and the first to do so is rewarded with a small\nstash. This happens about every 10 minutes. Some online retailers will accept bitcoins as payment. The\nmaximum potential number of bitcoins in circulation is 21\nmillion, compared with around 12 million currently. On the IRS guidance, William Lewis, a lawyer in Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia, who represents a start-up company creating a\nplatform for virtual currencies, said: "This is going to be\nunfavorable to bitcoin miners because they\'re going to have to\ninclude in income the fair market value of the virtual currency\non the date they mined it. "It\'s going to make life difficult for a lot of people who\nhave been mining over the past year, who have to go back and see\nwhat the values were on those dates when they mined it."\n\n (Additional reporting by Douwe Miedema; Editing by Steve\nOrlofsky)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0MM1L820140325', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 25, 19, 2), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'UPDATE 3-Bitcoins are property, not currency, IRS says regarding taxes'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/counterparties/2014/02/28/morning-bid-bitcoin-gravity-and-gravity/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' (The author is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed\nare his own.) By Neil Stempleman Oct 15 Consumers may be headed for trouble when\nthey turn over bank and brokerage pass codes to investment\nadvisers or get pulled into investment scams involving digital\ncurrencies, state securities regulators said. The North American Securities Administrators Association on\nTuesday added the two technology-related issues to its annual\nlist of top investor threats, where they joined the ongoing\ncatalog of risks the NASAA has highlighted in previous years,\nincluding oil and gas drilling and real estate investment\nschemes. The regulators\' organization said digital currencies, such\nas Bitcoin, offer consumers another way of paying for goods and\nservices, but they also provide a "fertile ground for scam\nartists to capitalize on ... (their) increasing popularity and\nacceptance." The regulators said that digital currencies are highly\nvolatile and the concept is difficult for even the sophisticated\ninvestor to understand. Bob Webster, director of communications for the association,\nsaid the warning was not about using Bitcoins or other virtual\ncurrencies, but about con artists using Bitcoin as a cover or\ninvestment lure. Putting virtual currencies on the association\'s list will\n"raise some flags, (and) put this on investors watch," he said. \n"Investors should try to learn and understand more about\nBitcoin." Bitcoin\'s website notes the volatility of the currency, and\nrisks from trying to get rich from using the new currency. The\nwebsite also says, "Bitcoin has no official organization,\nindividuals with authority, nor spokespeople." A co-founder of BitPay, a company that specializes\nprocessing Bitcoin payments, agreed with the NASAA\'s assessment\nof the danger from virtual currencies. Stephen Pair, who is also\nBitPay\'s chief technology officer, said in an email: "For anyone\nthat does not understand decentralized, cryptographic currencies\nlike Bitcoin, it is not a good idea to invest in them." "Aside from the fact that they are very new with a short\ntrack record, safely storing large amounts of them requires\nskill and experience in computer security," he said. "The NASAA\nis correct in stating that scam artists are attempting to\ncapitalize on the rising popularity of Bitcoin."  UNLICENSED ADVISERS Whenever an account is created, banks and brokerages warn\nabout the dangers of giving out a user name and password to a\nstranger, but investors do not always listen. The NASAA warned against "allowing an unlicensed individual\nto have access to the username and password for your brokerage\naccount or worse, allowing an unlicensed individual to set up a\nbrokerage account in your name." Brokers working for major firms are licensed and bonded. The association said investors should check with their state\nsecurities regulator to confirm that anyone seeking to manage\ntheir account is properly registered. TOP THREAT The top threat to investors is still fraudulent private\nplacement offerings, the association said. These offerings are\ncommonly called Reg D/Rule 506 offerings, after the federal\nsecurities law that allows private placements without\nregistration. The association said these are "limited investment\nofferings that are highly illiquid, generally lack transparency\nand have little regulatory oversight." While the offerings are used by many legitimate companies to\nraise capital, "they carry high risk and may not be suitable for\nmany individual investors," the association said. That is significant now, because recent U.S. laws have\nrelaxed restrictions on how these offerings can be marketed, and\n"investors soon will begin to see advertisements for private\nplacement offerings on a variety of platforms including social\nmedia, billboards, or t-shirts on window washers as one startup\nhas proposed, even though only a very small percentage of the \npopulation will be eligible to invest," the group said. Other top threats listed by the association included\nhigh-yield investment and Ponzi schemes, scam artists using\nself-directed IRAs to mask fraud, and risky oil and gas drilling\nprograms. The association\'s members include state and provincial\nregulators in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The threat\nlist is based on anecdotes and complaints from investors, and\nenforcement data collected by these regulators. Webster said the\nassociation would be releasing enforcement data on these threats\nin a few weeks.\n\n (Follow us @ReutersMoney or here\n Editing by Linda Stern and Steve Orlofsky)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0I51QP20131015', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 10, 15, 17, 1), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'State, provincial regulators raise red flags on virtual currency'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2014/12/26/bitcoins-defects-will-hasten-its-demise-in-2015/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/global-markets-forum/2014/05/01/bitcoin-regulations-could-come-as-early-as-summer-ny-regulator/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/financial-regulatory-forum/2014/01/06/u-s-treasury-cautions-bitcoin-businesses-on-compliance-duties-advocate-cites-chilling-effect/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/unstructuredfinance/2013/10/14/fbi-not-waiting-for-silk-road-owners-bitcoin-pword/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/counterparties/2013/10/03/getting-highs-and-lows-with-bitcoin/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/09/26/the-bitcoin-bug-bites-secondmarket/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' NEW YORK U.S. law enforcement authorities have shut down "Silk Road," an anonymous Internet marketplace for illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine and criminal activities such as murder for hire, and arrested its alleged owner. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Wednesday it arrested Silk Road owner, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, known online as "Dread Pirate Roberts," in San Francisco on Tuesday, according to court filings. Ulbricht, who holds an advanced degree in chemical engineering, appeared in federal court on Wednesday and a bail hearing was set for Friday. His lawyer Brandon LeBlanc, a public defender, declined to comment. Federal prosecutors in New York charged Ulbricht with one count each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, the filing said. "Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today," FBI agent Christopher Tarbell said in the criminal complaint. The site was used by "several thousand drug dealers" to sell "hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs," he said. The site, which has operated since early 2011, also offered tutorials on hacking ATM machines, contact lists for black market connections and counterfeiters, and guns and hit men for sale, according to the charges. More than 900,000 registered users of the site bought and sold drugs using the digital currency Bitcoin. In recent media reports about the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the Silk Road website has emerged as part of a darker side to the use of digital currencies. Through the site, according to the charges, users could buy drugs and have them shipped to an address. Investigators, posing as regular users on Silk Road, made more than 100 purchases of drugs, which were shipped to the New York area. "DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS" According to the complaint, Ulbricht, who shortened his alias from Dread Pirate Roberts to DPR when posting on Silk Road\'s forums, operated the site from San Francisco. At times, he used computers at Internet cafes to access the servers running the website, which employed several technological tools to mask the location of its servers and the identities of its administrators and users. The complaint described other aspects of Ulbricht\'s online presence: In a Google+ profile, he described himself as a fan of libertarian economic philosophy and posted videos from the Ludwig von Mises Institute, an Auburn, Alabama-based economics institute. Reached by phone in Austin, Texas, Ubricht\'s parents said they had not known what their son was doing in San Francisco. "He is a really stellar, good person and very idealistic," said Ulbricht\'s mother, Lyn Lacava. "I know he never meant to hurt anyone." Ulbricht\'s father Kirk confirmed his son had received a master\'s in material sciences from Pennsylvania State University. His thesis was titled: "Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy." "He did amazing research on crystals and exotic materials they hoped would have some use for humans," Ulbricht said. "But it was very theoretical stuff." The complaint against Ulbricht describes a darker side. During one correspondence with a Silk Road user, Ulbricht tried to call out a hit on another user with whom he had a dispute. That user, known online as "FriendlyChemist," was threatening to expose the identities of thousands of Silk Road users unless Ulbricht sent him money. "I wouldn\'t mind if he was executed," Ulbricht wrote, offering personal details about his foe, including the fact that he was a married father of three, and the names of the city and province where he lived. In a later post, Ulbricht wrote: "He is threatening to expose the identities of thousands of my clients." "This kind of behavior is unforgivable to me. Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct." BITCOIN CONNECTION During the raid, authorities seized $3.6 million worth of bitcoin, which was used instead of cash or credit cards to complete transactions on Silk Road. The charges against Ulbricht said his website generated sales of more than 9.5 million bitcoin, roughly equivalent to $1.2 billion. Authorities seized the currency by taking control of the digital "wallets" Silk Road used to store bitcoin. In a corresponding civil asset forfeiture action, prosecutors claimed Silk Road and Ulbricht were liable to the government for the value of all transactions involving drug tracking and computer hacking, as well as for money laundering penalties, and a final amount would be determined at trial. The raid on Wednesday was not the first time the U.S. government has made arrests related to Silk Road. Earlier this year, authorities in South Carolina arrested Eric Daniel Hughes, known on Silk Road as "Casey Jones," and charged him in state court with drug possession. The Drug Enforcement Agency seized units of bitcoin, which Hughes allegedly used to purchase drugs from the online market. Bitcoin, which has been around since 2008, first came under scrutiny by law enforcement officials in mid-2011 after media reports surfaced linking the digital currency to Silk Road.

Gox filed for bankruptcy, a half dozen employees at the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange challenged CEO Mark Karpeles over whether client money was being used to cover costs, according to three people who participated in the discussion. The question of how Mt. Gox handled other people\'s money - the issue raised by staff in the showdown with Karpeles in early 2012 - remains crucial to unraveling a multi-million dollar mystery under examination by authorities in Japan. A bankruptcy administrator and police are seeking to determine how a Tokyo start-up that shot from obscurity to dominate global trade in bitcoin managed to lose more than $27 million in old-fashioned cash held in a bank as well as bitcoins worth close to $450 million at today\'s prices. The still-unresolved issue has thrown a spotlight on how Mt. Gox functioned as a hybrid between an online brokerage and an exchange. Essentially, the more than 1 million traders who used Mt. Gox at its peak had entrusted a 3-year-old firm to hold their money safely until they decided to cash out. A court-appointed bankruptcy administrator on Friday said an initial examination of Mt. Gox - key to determining whether Mt. Gox\'s users will be able to recover some of what they had on deposit with the exchange - would not be complete until May, citing the involvement of authorities in the case. GROWING STRAINS In interviews with Reuters, current and former employees at Mt. Gox described the strains that emerged over the handling of customer money just as the firm was gearing up for expansion and bitcoin was edging out of the shadows as an investment and a means of online settlement. By early 2012, a small group of Mt. Gox employees, all of whom worked on one-year contracts, began to worry that customer funds had been diverted to cover operating costs that they estimated to be rising. Those costs included rent in a Tokyo high-rise that also housed offices for Hulu and Google, high-tech gadgets such as a robot and a 3-D printer and a souped-up, racing version of the Honda Civic imported from Britain for Karpeles, people who have reviewed expenses said. Unlike Karpeles, the employees say they did not have access to the financial records of Mt. Gox. They asked for a formal meeting with the then-26-year-old Karpeles in early 2012, those involved said, and asked him to respond to their estimate that Mt. Gox was spending more than it was taking in. They were also concerned that company expenses were being paid from the same bank account used for customer deposits. Karpeles told the group that customer money was not being used to fund the business, but declined to provide details on how the business had covered any loss. The meeting broke off after about an hour, those who participated said. Several of the staff say they left the inconclusive meeting frustrated that Karpeles would not share proof that client deposits had been protected. For his part, Karpeles believed he had thwarted a challenge to his leadership by staff who had no right to see the books of a firm he owned and was funding, a person familiar with his thinking said. Mt. Gox referred questions to its lawyers who had no immediate comment. The former Mt. Gox employees who spoke to Reuters asked not to be named because of potential legal complications. Tokyo police have taken evidence from Mt. Gox in recent days as part of an early-stage inquiry into what the company has described as possible theft. It is unclear how Japanese law would treat any such diversion of customer funds as Mt. Gox was not regulated as a financial institution. As a private firm in which Karpeles held an 88 percent stake with no declared debt, Mt. Gox was under no obligation to share any details on its finances. ACCOUNTING Mt. Gox said in its February 28 bankruptcy filing that hackers may have exploited what it called "a bug in the bitcoin system" to steal virtual currency from the exchange. It has not offered an explanation for the missing $27 million in cash. By 2012, from its offices in Tokyo\'s Shibuya neighborhood, Mt. Gox was handling at least $14 million in bitcoin trades per month, according to its estimates - equivalent to almost 90 percent of global trade in the digital currency at the time. Mt. Gox\'s only revenue came from a transaction fee initially set at 0.6 percent of trades and later discounted for big transactions, according to the company. Daily cash revenue for the exchange was just over $1,500, according to figures it posted on its website in August 2012 in a bid to reassure its traders that it was solvent. The company\'s accounting was complicated by it recording some revenue in bitcoin, which it used to cover some expenses, such as buying computer gear, a person who reviewed those transactions said. By April 2013, up to $20 million was flowing into the exchange every day, with $300,000 being cashed out, Karpeles told Reuters in an interview then. Karpeles was the only person at Mt. Gox who had access to the bank accounts, and each withdrawal request was handled manually, slowing the process, three former employees said. In its bankruptcy filing Mt. Gox did not list what remained in its bank accounts, including Mizuho Bank, which had been its main bank in Japan.

Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\'s Department of\nFinancial Services, expects to adopt consumer disclosure rules,\ncapital requirements and a framework for permissible investments\nwith consumer money. "Our objective is to provide appropriate guard rails to\nprotect consumers and root out money laundering without stifling\nbeneficial innovation," Lawsky said in a speech at the New\nAmerica Foundation in Washington. Lawsky said last month that his agency plans to issue rules\nfor businesses handling virtual currencies, including a\n"BitLicense", which could make New York the first U.S. state to\nregulate virtual currencies such as bitcoins. Bitcoin proponents like the fact that it and a host of other\ncurrencies generated by computer programs are not backed by a\ngovernment or central bank, and that their value fluctuates only\naccording to demand. But the industry has been plagued by scandals. Last month, \nthe vice chairman of a trade group was charged by U.S.\nprosecutors with conspiring to commit money laundering using\nBitcoin. On Tuesday, Slovenia-based Bitstamp became the second major\nbitcoin exchange to halt customer withdrawals in the past\nseveral days, citing "inconsistent results", and blaming a\ndenial-of-service attack. That was a day after the value of bitcoin slid to its lowest\nin nearly two months after Mt. Gox, the best known digital\nmarketplace operator, said a halt on withdrawals would continue\nindefinitely. The price of bitcoin, which has gained wider acceptance in\nrecent months, also varied dramatically from one exchange to\nanother. On Tuesday, it was quoted at $645 per coin on\nBitstamp\'s exchange, down 6 percent on the day.  TRICKY QUESTIONS Still, Lawsky also highlighted positive aspects of the new\ntechnology, saying there was room for a thriving industry as\nlong as it stuck to the rules, avoided money laundering, and did\nnot duck regulation off-shore. "I\'m hoping we\'ll make New York an attractive place for\nthose who want to do this the right way," he said. Consumers needed to be told clearly about risks in the\nvirtual currency, such as the fact that transactions are\ngenerally irreversible, and that they could lose their money if\nthey hold onto bitcoins for an extended period. More challenging questions include capital requirements for\nfirms to absorb unexpected losses, and how many risks they can\ntake with investments. One issue is whether the firms should be\nallowed to invest in virtual currencies. "The really tricky question for regulators is how we\nstructure those type of rules in light of the fact that the\nfunds these firms hold are not denominated in dollars or other\nforms of traditional fiat currencies," Lawsky said. Lawsky expected to release the regulations in the spring or\nthe summer of this year, and said the agency would seek public\ncomment once it had published the plan in a so-called notice for\nproposed rule making. His agency is still wrestling with whether to ban or\nrestrict the use of "tumblers", which obscure the record and\nsource of virtual currencies. Tumblers are a concern to law\nenforcement, but they might also have legitimate uses. He said most virtual currencies have public ledgers which,\nwhen combined with know-your-customer guidelines, could serve as\nanti-money laundering controls. Lawsky added that he is grappling with what types of firms\nand transactions to regulate. The remarks follow two days of hearings in New York on the\npotential regulation of virtual currencies. Witnesses at the\nlate January hearings included state and federal prosecutors, as\nwell as industry participants such as the investor twins Cameron\nand Tyler Winklevoss. Also on Tuesday, Canada said it will toughen rules targeting\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing to keep a closer eye on\nthe use of virtual currencies.\n\n (Reporting by Douwe Miedema in Washington and Karen Freifeld in\nNew York.

The banks are part of a consortium of 42 major lenders,\nbrought together last year by New York-based R3 CEV to work on\nways blockchain technology could be used in financial markets -\nthe first time so many have collaborated on using such systems. A blockchain is a huge, decentralised ledger of transactions\nthat can be used to secure and validate any exchange of data,\nincluding real assets, such as commodities or currencies. Bitcoin\'s blockchain was the first, but others have since\nbeen built that offer additional features and can be programmed.\nThat means the technology can enable so-called smart contracts:\nagreements that are automatically executed when pre-determined\nconditions are met. For this experiment, the banks tried five different\nblockchain-technology providers to test trading fixed income:\nEthereum, often considered the most advanced and ambitious,\nChain, Eris Industries, IBM and Intel. "We have raised the bar significantly with the sheer number\nof global financial institutions, distributed ledger\ntechnologies and cloud providers working together ... to\ndemonstrate how this nascent technology can be applied to ... an\nactively traded asset class," said the head of R3\'s\nCollaborative Lab, Tim Grant. Banks reckon the technology could save them money by cutting\nout middlemen and making their operations more transparent. But\nanalysts say it is early days - bitcoin was invented just six\nyears ago and developers are still working on the technology. Indeed, the G20\'s Financial Stability Board said on Saturday\nassessing the systemic implications of fintech innovations would\nform part of the task force\'s core policy work this year and\nglobal regulators could propose rules to prevent them from\ndestabilising the broader financial system. Chain\'s CEO Adam Ludwin said: "R3 is further accelerating\nthe adoption of blockchain technology by demonstrating, instead\nof simply asserting, the commercial advantages of this emerging\napproach to financial services."

"We have seen increasing use of such currencies by drug dealers, traffickers of child pornography, and perpetrators of large-scale fraud schemes," Mythili Raman, the acting assistant attorney general for the division, told a Senate panel. The currencies offer criminals both anonymity and the ability to process transactions that cannot be reversed, which can "significantly complicate" the government\'s ability to follow money trails in related criminal investigations, she told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Further complicating efforts, many digital currency services do not have controls to protect against abuse, Raman said. "Many are still struggling with implementing appropriate anti-money laundering, know-your-customer and customer due diligence programs," she said in prepared remarks. Raman appeared alongside top officials from the Secret Service and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network before the Senate Homeland Security Committee to answer questions about the growing use of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, and whether the government is doing enough to police the market. It was the first such hearing before Congress, and Bitcoin surged over 27 percent to a new high of US$675 ahead of the hearing.

NEW METHODS Virtual currencies or digital cash have increasingly become a popular new way to purchase goods or services. They are not regulated or issued by a central bank. They have been touted by some as an alternative currency in countries facing financial instability. The most popular virtual currency is Bitcoin, which exists through an open-source software program and whose supply is controlled by a computer algorithm. But critics have raised concerns about a lack of regulatory oversight over virtual currencies and the fact that some of them can be transferred anonymously, raising fears that they could be used by scam artists. The general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation, Patrick Murck, told lawmakers that digital currencies offer many benefits and are not only a cloak for illegal business. But he added that law enforcement would have to develop new methods to investigate some criminal activity.

Around the same time, U.S. criminal authorities also indicted the operators of the digital currency exchange Liberty Reserve and accused the company of helping criminals launder more than $6 billion in funds linked to everything from child pornography to software used for bank hacking. In October, federal authorities shut down an online marketplace called Silk Road that was used for purchasing drugs and hiring hit men.

Findings by WizSec, an independent consulting firm, showed that bitcoins were periodically being stolen from the Tokyo-based exchange two years before its collapse, the newspaper reported online. The collapse of MtGox, after it lost track of some 850,000 coins worth $500 million, triggered thousands of creditor claims and a police investigation into the collapse is ongoing, the newspaper said.  WizSec said most or all of the missing bitcoins were taken from an online pool held for settling daily transactions. The investigators pored over millions of entries on the blockchain, the central ledger that records all transfers between bitcoin addresses, and found a pattern. MtGox-related bitcoins would periodically be sent to a new non-MtGox address, without a withdrawal log entry, often in lots of a few hundred coins at a time, the FT said. These addresses would then be pooled to form bigger addresses holding a few thousand bitcoin. From there, the coins would be deposited in chunks of a few hundred in various bitcoin exchanges and probably sold for cash. "This kind of activity would be hard to interpret as anything but intentional theft," wrote Kim Nilsson, the report\'s author, and WizSec\'s chief engineer.

Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center relented to the demands, President Allen Stefanek said, because he believed it was the "quickest and most efficient way" to free the Los Angeles hospital\'s network, which was paralyzed for about 10 days. That announcement sparked fears Thursday among hospitals and security experts that it would embolden hackers to launch more "ransomware" attacks and calls in California for tougher laws. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than if they took all the patients and held them in one room at gunpoint,\u201d said California State Senator Robert Hertzberg, who on Thursday introduced legislation to make a ransomware attack equivalent to extortion and punishable by up to four years in prison.     Usually embarrassment and a desire to discourage hackers keep attacked companies quiet. Hollywood Presbyterian did not say why it made the disclosure, but its hand may have been forced by spreading rumors a week after the hack. Stefanek confirmed the cyber attack after at least one doctor appeared to have told local media.  In addition, he disputed media reports the 434-bed hospital had faced a ransom demand of $3.4 million, far more than the amount paid in the hard-to-trace cyber-currency bitcoin. In a ransomware attack, hackers infect PCs with malicious software that encrypts valuable files so they are inaccessible, then offer to unlock the data only if the victim pays a ransom. The hack at Hollywood Presbyterian forced doctors to use pen and paper in an age of computerization. News reports said its fax lines were jammed because normal e-mail communication was unavailable, and some emergency patients had to be diverted to other hospitals. Investigators said administrators were so alarmed that they may have paid ransom first and called police later. Medical facilities in the area plan to consult cyber security experts on how to protect themselves, the Hospital Association of Southern California said. \u201cHospitals are certainly now aware of ransomware more than they ever were before, and this has become a very real threat,\u201d said spokeswoman Jennifer Bayer. Some experts said ransomware encryption can be so hard to crack that victims feel they have little choice but to pay if they want their systems back. The hackers\' success could also prompt other hospitals to make quick payments to avoid the disruption and bad publicity Hollywood Presbyterian faced. \u201cOur number one fear is that this now pretty much opens the door for other people to pay," said Bob Shaker, a manager at cyber security firm Symantec Corp.  \'CAT AND MOUSE\' He knew of at least 20 other attacks on healthcare facilities in the past year and hundreds more in other industries that had been kept secret. Some of those put patients at risk and affected infusion pumps that deliver chemotherapy drugs, risking patient overdoses, he said. Because hackers hide their identities and demand payment in bitcoin, authorities may have to work harder to find them than if they used old-fashioned methods. But cyber-crime experts say that they can still be traced. "The public nature of the network does give law enforcement an angle to help defeat them," said Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, a New York company working with bitcoin users. "But it\u2019s a game of cat and mouse."      Ransomware is big business for cyber criminals and security professionals. Although ransoms typically are less than the hospital paid, $200 to $10,000, victims of a ransomware known as CryptoWall reported losses over $18 million from April 2014 to June 2015, the FBI said. Ransomware attacks climbed sharply in 2014, when Symantec observed some 8.8 million cases, more than double the previous year. IBM said that last year more than half of all customer calls reporting cyber attacks involved ransomware.

That announcement sparked fears Thursday among hospitals and security experts that it would embolden hackers to launch more "ransomware" attacks and calls in California for tougher laws. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than if they took all the patients and held them in one room at gunpoint,\u201d said California State Senator Robert Hertzberg, who on Thursday introduced legislation to make a ransomware attack equivalent to extortion and punishable by up to four years in prison.     Usually embarrassment and a desire to discourage hackers keep attacked companies quiet. Hollywood Presbyterian did not say why it made the disclosure, but its hand may have been forced by spreading rumors a week after the hack. Stefanek confirmed the cyber attack after at least one doctor appeared to have told local media.  In addition, he disputed media reports the 434-bed hospital had faced a ransom demand of $3.4 million, far more than the amount paid in the hard-to-trace cyber-currency bitcoin. In a ransomware attack, hackers infect PCs with malicious software that encrypts valuable files so they are inaccessible, then offer to unlock the data only if the victim pays a ransom. The hack at Hollywood Presbyterian forced doctors to use pen and paper in an age of computerization. News reports said its fax lines were jammed because normal e-mail communication was unavailable, and some emergency patients had to be diverted to other hospitals. Investigators said administrators were so alarmed that they may have paid ransom first and called police later. Medical facilities in the area plan to consult cyber security experts on how to protect themselves, the Hospital Association of Southern California said. \u201cHospitals are certainly now aware of ransomware more than they ever were before, and this has become a very real threat,\u201d said spokeswoman Jennifer Bayer. Some experts said ransomware encryption can be so hard to crack that victims feel they have little choice but to pay if they want their systems back. The hackers\' success could also prompt other hospitals to make quick payments to avoid the disruption and bad publicity Hollywood Presbyterian faced. \u201cOur number one fear is that this now pretty much opens the door for other people to pay," said Bob Shaker, a manager at cyber security firm Symantec Corp.  \'CAT AND MOUSE\' He knew of at least 20 other attacks on healthcare facilities in the past year and hundreds more in other industries that had been kept secret. Some of those put patients at risk and affected infusion pumps that deliver chemotherapy drugs, risking patient overdoses, he said. Because hackers hide their identities and demand payment in bitcoin, authorities may have to work harder to find them than if they used old-fashioned methods. But cyber-crime experts say that they can still be traced. "The public nature of the network does give law enforcement an angle to help defeat them," said Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, a New York company working with bitcoin users. "But it\u2019s a game of cat and mouse."      Ransomware is big business for cyber criminals and security professionals. Although ransoms typically are less than the hospital paid, $200 to $10,000, victims of a ransomware known as CryptoWall reported losses over $18 million from April 2014 to June 2015, the FBI said. Ransomware attacks climbed sharply in 2014, when Symantec observed some 8.8 million cases, more than double the previous year. IBM said that last year more than half of all customer calls reporting cyber attacks involved ransomware.

Trustwave said on Monday that it has found evidence that the\noperators of a cybercrime ring known as the Pony botnet have\nstolen some 85 virtual "wallets" that contained bitcoins and\nother types of digital currencies. The firm said it did not know\nhow much digital currency was contained in the wallets. "It is the first time we saw such a widespread presence of\nthis type of malware. It was on hundreds of thousands of\nmachines," said Ziv Mador, security research director with\nChicago-based Trustwave. Trustwave said it believes the crime ring is still\noperating, though it does not know who is running the group. The\ncompany said it has disrupted the servers that were controlling\nmachines infected with Pony, but expects the group to launch\nmore attacks on virtual currency users. A representative for the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group\nthat promotes adoption of the digital currency, did not\nimmediately respond to requests for comment. Trustwave\'s discovery comes in the wake of an unrelated\ncyber attack that spammed bitcoin exchanges earlier this month.\nThat attack prompted at least three online virtual currency\ntraders to halt withdrawals, causing bitcoin\'s value to plunge\n33 percent over three weeks. Bitcoin is a digital currency sustained by software code\nwritten by an unknown programmer or group of programmers. It is\nnot governed by any one company or person, and its value is\ndetermined by user demand. People who buy digital currency can store it in virtual\nwallets on their own machines or with companies that offer\nstorage and security services. Mador said digital currency theft is still in its infancy,\nbut that it is likely to grow. "If digital currencies become more popular, this type of\ncampaign is likely to get much bigger," he said.  NEW OPPORTUNITY Digital currency buyers can easily protect themselves from\nhackers by encrypting digital currency files, Mador said. "Most websites don\'t encrypt them by default, but you can\nturn them on," he added. Botnets are collections of infected computers that take\norders from central "command and control" servers. The botnets\nsteal data from compromised PCs and can also deliver other types\nof malware that force them to perform tasks. This is at least the third type of fraud to surface\ninvolving digital currencies. Criminals have previously hacked\ninto marketplaces where digital currencies are traded by\nexploiting security flaws in those sites, then stealing those\ncurrencies, according to Trustwave. () Cyber criminals have also developed botnets that force\nenslaved computers to create, or "mine", digital currencies,\nwhich the fraudsters then claim as their own. Bitcoin mining is a time-consuming process in which\ncomputers perform complex math calculations. The operators of\nthose botnets are stealing electricity and data center resources\nwhen they use compromised machines to mine digital currencies. Trustwave in December uncovered a trove of some 2 million\nstolen passwords to websites including Facebook Inc,\nGoogle Inc, Twitter Inc and Yahoo Inc \nwhile probing a command and control server using a less\nsophisticated version of the Pony malware. Trustwave said on Monday that the new version of Pony\ncompromised another 600,000 website credentials.

The world\'s 600 virtual currencies are tiny, with bitcoin alone accounting for 90 percent of the $7 billion sector, compared with daily turnover of about $5 trillion on global foreign exchange markets. Virtual currencies are traded online and not backed by a central bank. The collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox two years ago raised concerns about consumer protection in a largely self-regulated, experimental sector. After the attacks in Paris last November, policymakers also want to ensure that virtual currencies are not used to finance terrorism. The EU\'s European Commission has powers to propose bloc-wide rules, but one of its senior financial services officials, Olivier Salles, said his focus was on monitoring rather than proposing new rules. "It\'s easy to fail when you regulate, you can be too early and too late. From the European Commission\'s perspective, we are more on the monitoring side," Salles told a hearing on virtual currencies in the European Parliament. "We want to understand better what is happening," Salles said. The EU executive is examining options to prevent activities like money laundering, but "we are not in a hurry" to regulate financial products linked to virtual currencies, he added. Sean Ennis, an economist at the OECD club of rich nations, said the EU could learn lessons from how Britain has maintained lower regulatory requirements for peer-to-peer lending, enabling the fledgling sector to innovate and grow much faster than in the rest of Europe. "I am very modest about the potential for regulation," Ennis said, echoing the International Monetary Fund\'s first paper on virtual currencies published last week.  It said regulatory responses should be in line with risks and not stifle innovation. Policymakers are turning their attention to the technology underlying the currencies, known as blockchain, which has the potential to shake up the payments system. Jakob von Weizsaecker, a German center member of the European Parliament, said regulators needed to understand blockchain better before it became more commonly used.  He is compiling a report on virtual currencies, which the commission will study, and said that precautionary monitoring rather than immediate regulation was probably best. Bitcoin transactions are dominated by about 20 companies, said Jeremy Millar of technology consultants Magister Advisors. "They are putting in regulatory capital, they are already registered with the regulators, by and large. If the companies and the activities are already regulated, I don\'t know what it means to regulate the technology," Millar said. The European Union is due to unveil measures next month to tackle terrorism financing.

Blockchain technology - or distributed ledger technology, as\nthe DTCC and other financiers prefers to call it - underpins\nbitcoin, a controversial web-based "cryptocurrency".\nIt is a massive ledger of every bitcoin transaction made, which\nis verified and shared by a global network of computers. But the data that can be secured by the blockchain need not\nbe restricted to bitcoin transactions. Any two parties could use\nit to exchange information or assets, within minutes and with no\nneed for a central authority to verify it. The International Monetary Fund said in a research paper\nlast week that blockchain technology could pose a serious\nchallenge to the business models of established financial\nsystem, a view shared by the Bank for International Settlements\n[. In a white paper published on Monday, the DTCC said the\ntechnology could "modernize, streamline and simplify the siloed\ndesign of the financial industry infrastructure and address\ncertain limitations of the current post-trade process". The DTCC, a financial services group controlled by\ninvestment banks, said blockchain technology could speed up and\nsimplify trade and contract validation, the issuance of assets\nand securities, and settlement and clearing processes. "The industry has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to\nre-imagine and modernize its infrastructure to resolve\nlong-standing operational challenges," said DTCC CEO Michael\nBodson. The DTCC did, however, caution that the technology is still\nimmature and, in its current form, has limited scale. The group recently invested in Digital Asset Holdings LLC, a\nblockchain start-up aimed at the financial services industry and\nrun by former JPMorgan banker Blythe Masters. Last week New-York based R3 CEV, which calls itself a\n"financial technology innovation company", said that 11 banks in\na global consortium set up by R3 last year had successfully\ntested a blockchain-based trading system that could make trading\nmuch faster and cheaper.\n\n (Reporting By Jemima Kelly, editing by Larry King)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Jemima Kelly'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1593OZ', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 25, 12, 22), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'DTCC calls for collaboration on blockchain use in post-trade services'}, {'articleText': u' LONDON The European Union will monitor rather than regulate "hyped" virtual currencies for now, because too little is known to justify new rules beyond reining in specific risks like money-laundering, the body\'s executive said on Monday.  The world\'s 600 virtual currencies are tiny, with bitcoin alone accounting for 90 percent of the $7 billion sector, compared with daily turnover of about $5 trillion on global foreign exchange markets. Virtual currencies are traded online and not backed by a central bank. The collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox two years ago raised concerns about consumer protection in a largely self-regulated, experimental sector. After the attacks in Paris last November, policymakers also want to ensure that virtual currencies are not used to finance terrorism. The EU\'s European Commission has powers to propose bloc-wide rules, but one of its senior financial services officials, Olivier Salles, said his focus was on monitoring rather than proposing new rules. "It\'s easy to fail when you regulate, you can be too early and too late. From the European Commission\'s perspective, we are more on the monitoring side," Salles told a hearing on virtual currencies in the European Parliament. "We want to understand better what is happening," Salles said. The EU executive is examining options to prevent activities like money laundering, but "we are not in a hurry" to regulate financial products linked to virtual currencies, he added. Sean Ennis, an economist at the OECD club of rich nations, said the EU could learn lessons from how Britain has maintained lower regulatory requirements for peer-to-peer lending, enabling the fledgling sector to innovate and grow much faster than in the rest of Europe. "I am very modest about the potential for regulation," Ennis said, echoing the International Monetary Fund\'s first paper on virtual currencies published last week.  It said regulatory responses should be in line with risks and not stifle innovation. Policymakers are turning their attention to the technology underlying the currencies, known as blockchain, which has the potential to shake up the payments system. Jakob von Weizsaecker, a German center member of the European Parliament, said regulators needed to understand blockchain better before it became more commonly used.  He is compiling a report on virtual currencies, which the commission will study, and said that precautionary monitoring rather than immediate regulation was probably best. Bitcoin transactions are dominated by about 20 companies, said Jeremy Millar of technology consultants Magister Advisors. "They are putting in regulatory capital, they are already registered with the regulators, by and large. If the companies and the activities are already regulated, I don\'t know what it means to regulate the technology," Millar said. The European Union is due to unveil measures next month to tackle terrorism financing.

For more than two years, according to U.S. authorities, the website allowed users to buy and sell illegal goods and services on the assumption that they were safe from the law. The buyers were cloaked by technology designed to keep identities secret and transactions were processed with bitcoin digital currency. Silk Road\'s alleged creator, 29-year-old Ross William Ulbricht, was arrested in San Francisco by FBI agents on Tuesday after investigators apparently linked his personal email address to the website, which has been shut down. Ulbricht\'s lawyer Brandon LeBlanc, a public defender, declined to comment. The crackdown on Silk Road is the latest in a series of moves by law enforcement against digital currencies, which critics say are a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. "Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today," FBI agent Christopher Tarbell said in the criminal complaint. Based on court documents filed since the arrest, Silk Road -named for the ancient trade routes between China and the West - offered a wide array of wares. Customers could buy a gram of cocaine for 0.8956 bitcoin, or about $127 at an exchange rate of $142 per bitcoin. That exchange rate fell to as low as $110 per bitcoin on Tuesday, after the Silk Road bust was announced. A half pound of "hydroponic bud" was running about 17.2 bitcoins and 25 LSD blotters were on offer for 1.48 bitcoins, according to court filings that included screen shots of the product listings. Vendors showed photos of crushed white powder, marijuana, pills and other illicit-looking substances. The website included nearly 13,000 listings for controlled substances as of September 23, according to the court documents. "Quality is superb ... Best stuff I\'ve seen in a while," one user reported, according to the documents, saying he received a shipment of heroin overnight from a dealer known as "gotsitall 5.0." Gotsitall 5.0 charged an extra $12 to insure his product, which he described as "high quality #4 heroin all rock," according to the documents. Another vendor offered the services of "hitmen" operating in more than 10 countries, according to the FBI. Tarbell said in the complaint that buyers could also purchase firearms and the services of hackers offering to break into ATMs and social networking accounts on Facebook or Twitter. They also sold computer viruses that could be used to attack personal computers, as well as access to compromised accounts on online services such as Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, he said. CAUGHT IN A LIBRARY The end for Silk Road came in the small Glen Park branch of the San Francisco public library system on Tuesday afternoon. At least six plainclothes FBI agents seized Ulbricht as he lingered at a corner table on the second floor near the science fiction section, pressing him up against a window and announcing he was under arrest, a library spokeswoman said. A Silk Road wiki had offered advice on how to avoid getting caught by authorities. A seller\'s guide advised sellers to vacuum seal packages containing narcotics to avoid detection by dogs or electronic sniffers, according to the complaint. The court documents allege that altogether bitcoins worth some $1.2 billion changed hands through the Silk Road site, which charged commissions of between 8 and 15 percent before it was shut down after a 2 1/2-year run. Silk Road processed all transactions with bitcoin, which leaves no traditional money trail for investigators to follow. The site also routed traffic through a no-cost, anti-surveillance service known as the Tor network. Tor sends traffic through multiple virtual "tunnels" and relays in a bid to keep Web users\' identities secret. It also provides "hidden services" to help websites keep the locations of their servers confidential by routing traffic to them from other locations. Tor, which was originally developed with a seed grant from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, is an open source project backed by people who say they are concerned about internet surveillance. It is accessible to anybody, including criminals. The complaint describes some of the steps by which investigators came to the conclusion that Ulbricht was the owner of the site, known online as "Dread Pirate Roberts." It said the mistakes included using a Google email address, rossulbricht@gmail.com, for communications linked to Silk Road, such as promotional material about the website dating back to January 2011.

These days, wealth often exists in digital form, and the landscape for currency trading is changing. OpenCoin is a startup building a simple, global, open currency system. Today, the company announced it has an angel round of funding to expand the Ripple protocol, a virtual currency and payments system that allows \u201canyone in the world to trade any amount of money in any currency.\u201d \u201cOur world has moved into a digital era, and it is time that we embrace a digital currency that can accommodate today\u2019s global commerce needs while laying the groundwork for future evolution,\u201d said OpenCoin CTO Jed McCaleb in a statement. \u201cNow, wherever there is Internet, there is Ripple. The future is here.\u201d Ripples are a virtual currency. The Ripple network is a decentralized, open source, peer-to-peer payment network that enables free payments to merchants, consumers, and developers in any currency. According to the site, Ripple was invented by Bitcoin enthusiasts to update money for the Internet era. The system does not require ACH, banks, or credit card networks, and transactions are confirmed within seconds, there are no restrictions, minimum fees, or penalties, and the fees are \u201cfreeish,\u201d at $0.0001 per transaction. Money is digital and basically a number associated with an account that goes up and down depending on activity. Money is also often distributed across multiple accounts that require time, fees, and passwords to exchange. Since all the information on Ripple is kept within Ripple, it can avoid \u201cthe costs, delays, and inconveniences of system-hopping.\u201d Money goes in and out of Ripple through the \u2018Ripple gateway,\u2019 which acts as a bridge to the outside economy. At the center is \u2018The Ledger,\u2019 which tracks every transaction, account, and balance. Bitcoin has made the nature of currency, wealth, and trading a hot button discussion topic as the value of this purely electronic, nationless currency goes up and down, with the entire tech community breathlessly following its fluctuation. Bitcoins are not the only volatile forms of currency, however, as the Euro crisis has shown. Whether it is Bitcoin, US dollars, Japanese yen, or Euros, Ripple has created a hub at the center to simplify their exchange. OpenCoin was founded by Chris Larsen, who founded E-LOAN and Prosper, and McCaleb, who worked on eDonkey and Bitcoin Exchange Mt. Gox.

Stung by last week\'s Paris attacks, which Islamic State has claimed, the G7 finance ministers discussed the regulation of "fintechs" or financial technology firms on Monday at a private meeting during a Group of 20 summit in Turkey, the magazine said. The German Finance Ministry declined to comment, saying that G7 ministerial meetings were confidential. The software-based financial services that FinTechs offer, including digital or \'virtual\' currencies such as bitcoin, often operate across borders and beyond the reach of security officials. Bitcoin, which exists only in digital form, can be used to move money around the world quickly and anonymously without the need for third-party verification. That has made it attractive to users ranging from drug dealers to those trying to circumvent capital controls in Greece and China.

Anthony Murgio, 31, pleaded not guilty in federal court in Manhattan to charges that he committed wire fraud and money laundering and operated an unlicensed money transmitting business. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan set a trial date for Oct. 31, 2016. Murgio also said at Friday\'s hearing that he was switching counsel, though he did not say why. His new lawyer, Robert Soloway, replaces Gregory Kehoe. Murgio\'s plea came a week after U.S. prosecutors unveiled related charges against three men accused of engaging in a cyber-criminal enterprise that hacked into a dozen companies\' networks, stealing personal information of over 100 million people. Those companies included JPMorgan, which prosecutors said suffered the theft of records belonging to more than 83 million customers. The three men included two Israelis, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, and one American, Joshua Samuel Aaron. Murgio, a resident of Tampa, Florida, was not accused of engaging in the hacking offenses or many of the related alleged crimes they helped facilitate, including a series of stock manipulation frauds. But prosecutors said he operated an unlicensed bitcoin exchange called Coin.mx that exchanged millions of dollars of the virtual currency for customers and that was owned by Shalon, who authorities say orchestrated the hacking attacks. Murgio also had ties to Aaron. Both men attended Florida State University, and in 2008 they formed a business together. On his website, Murgio calls Aaron "my friend" and said he "showed me the ropes to online marketing." Shalon, 31, and Orenstein, 40, were arrested in Israel in July, and the United States is seeking their extradition. Aaron, 31, is wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which says as of June he was believed to be in Eastern Europe. According to prosecutors, the three engaged in a series criminal schemes, including manipulating stocks, operating illegal online casinos, processing payments for criminals and owning the unlicensed bitcoin exchange. Those schemes generated hundreds of millions dollars and were furthered by hacking companies including JPMorgan, E*Trade Financial Corp and News Corp\'s Dow Jones unit, in order to steal customer information, prosecutors said. The case is U.S. v. Murgio, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.

Idan Aharoni, the head of cyber intelligence at EMC Corp\'s RSA security division, said that some online scam artists and thieves are using Perfect Money\'s digital currency to launder money and conceal profits in much the same way they allegedly did with Liberty Reserve\'s currency. On behalf of their clients, which include major financial institutions, Aharoni and his team monitor Internet forums that hackers use to sell stolen credit card information. After Liberty Reserve was taken down in May, activity on these forums initially slowed and then picked up again, with some hackers saying they would accept Perfect Money for payments, he said. "We expected a large migration to another e-currency, and that has happened," said Aharoni, whose RSA unit sells security services to 30,000 corporations and government agencies, including the popular Secure ID tokens that protect access to computer systems. Perfect Money, which has been in operation since at least 2007, could not be reached for comment. A request submitted through its website failed to elicit a response, and the company does not list a phone number for its offices or identify any management or employees. Reuters could not determine who owns Perfect Money. Its website says it is based in Panama, but the Panamanian government said in a statement in January that Perfect Money does not have offices in the country and has not been issued any licenses by securities regulators to operate there. Law enforcement agencies in the United States and around the world have expressed concerns that digital currencies, which are not tied to any particular government, are emerging as vehicles for hackers, cyber criminals and drug dealers to launder money. Currencies like Perfect Money are governed by a single company or entity that administers the transfer of units between customers. Once a user obtains an account, he or she can transfer Perfect Money units to other users inside the system. These units can be redeemed for cash or bank credit by third-party exchange services, which are separate businesses not under control of the currency\'s operator. Online vendors of all kinds can choose to accept digital currencies like Perfect Money as payment for their goods and services. But the feature that makes some digital currencies ideal for money laundering is anonymity. User identities can be kept hidden, both from each other and, with varying degrees of effort, from the currency operator itself through false names and locations. U.S. prosecutors in May accused Liberty Reserve\'s Costa Rica-based operations of laundering some $6 billion in illicit profits over about seven years. Authorities arrested Liberty Reserve\'s principals and shuttered the firm. Seth Ginsberg, a lawyer for former Liberty Reserve principal Mark Marmilev, who has pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges, said it is not fair for the authorities to punish his client because some customers use Liberty Reserve to hide their illicit activities. "It\'s my understanding that Liberty Reserve was designed to compete with mainstream financial providers. The fact that it may have been misused by various customers should not reflect on the company," said Ginsburg. "There is a legitimate need for alternatives to the mainstream financial market, so the fact that there\'s another company out there filling the void left by Liberty Reserve is not surprising." A spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. law enforcement agency that focuses most closely on cyber attacks on financial institutions, declined to comment. VIRTUAL MONEY Venture capitalists and free market advocates have voiced strong support for online currencies such as Bitcoin, saying they are alternatives to conventional monetary systems that can burden the poorest people in the world with transaction fees. The more due diligence that currency operators perform on their customers, mostly by verifying the personal information they submit when signing up for an account, the harder it is for criminals to use them to launder money. According to its website, Perfect Money performs an identity check on each customer to try to identify the computer used to enter the account. It said the company collects information about each customer\'s online activity and monitors transactions for signs of suspicious activity. Perfect Money is not the only payment system that cyber criminals use, experts said. Stefan Savage, a computer science professor at the University of California, said he had observed several different currencies, including Bitcoin, being used by people selling stolen credit cards in Internet hacker forums. "Perfect Money is certainly one that comes up a lot," Savage said. "There are tons of these payment systems out there." Patrick Murck, general counsel for The Bitcoin Foundation, declined to comment. The Foundation is a non-profit group of software developers and entrepreneurs that helps promote the use of Bitcoin as a currency. Bitcoin exists through an open-source software program and is not managed by any one company. Its supply is controlled through a computer algorithm. A Reuters review of postings on Internet message boards for digital currencies found hackers offering to sell stolen credit cards are open about accepting Perfect Money as payment. "If it was expected at first that the Liberty Reserve takedown would have a long-lasting, substantial effect on the level of fraud, that\'s not true," Aharoni said. Tyler Moore, an assistant professor at Southern Methodist University, said a 2011 study he conducted with two other academics found that Liberty Reserve and Perfect Money were two of the most widely accepted digital currencies for online Ponzi schemes. Of 1,000 websites that linked to Perfect Money, they found 70 percent that were Ponzi schemes. "Perfect Money seems to be a very popular choice among this subculture," Moore said.

"Regulation keeps them in place. Regulation requires them to perform certain functions," said Mark Smith, chief executive of Symbiont.io, a startup that has emerged from Bitcoin 2.0 and MathMoney f(x) Inc to build a securities trading platform using blockchain technology like that behind bitcoin. Smith predicted that big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, would adopt new technologies to cut costs for back offices that process loans and match buyers and sellers of securities. "A massive amount of infrastructure just goes away," said Smith, who was speaking on Thursday in a panel discussion held by Thomson Reuters on innovation and disruption in financial services. New competitors are coming into banking from Silicon Valley, JPMorgan\'s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned bank shareholders this year. But he also said JPMorgan had much to learn from them and might enter partnerships with some. JPMorgan worked with Apple Inc on last year\'s launch of the Apple Pay application for making credit and debit card payments with smartphones. Last month the bank said it would also operate a rival digital wallet called Chase Pay. Later, Smith said his firm expected to sell tools to big banks for securities trading by customers. "We are a disrupter and an enabler as well," he added. Another panel member, Sam Shrauger, senior vice president of digital solutions at card and payments company Visa Inc, said that while cash and paper check transactions give way to electronic messages, "that\'s not going to change the overarching way that we move money."

Gery Shalon, Joshua Samuel Aaron and Ziv Orenstein, all from Israel, were charged in a 23-count indictment with alleged crimes targeting 12 companies, including nine financial services companies and media outlets including The Wall Street Journal. Prosecutors said the enterprise dated from 2007, and caused the exposure of personal information belonging to more than 100 million people. "By any measure, the data breaches at these firms were breathtaking in scope and in size," and signal a "brave new world of hacking for profit," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at a press conference in Manhattan.  The alleged enterprise included pumping up stock prices, online casinos, payment processing for criminals, an illegal bitcoin exchange, and the laundering of money through at least 75 shell companies and accounts around the world. Tuesday\'s charges expand a case first announced in July, and according to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch target "one of the largest thefts of financial-related data in history." The charges are also the first tied to the JPMorgan attack, which prosecutors said involved the stealing of records belonging to more than 83 million customers, the largest theft of customer data from a U.S. financial institution. Authorities said Shalon and Aaron executed that hacking, using a computer server in Egypt that they had rented under an alias that Shalon often used.  E*TRADE, TD AMERITRADE, NEWS CORP  A separate indictment unveiled in Atlanta against Shalon, Aaron and an unnamed defendant said the brokerages E*Trade Financial Corp and Scotttrade Inc were also targets, and personal information of more than 10 million customers was compromised. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp and News Corp\'s Dow Jones unit, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, said they were also targets. Fidelity Investments was also a target, a person familiar with the matter said.  Other targets could not be immediately verified.  Shalon, 31, of Savyon, Israel, and Orenstein, 40, of Bat Hefer, Israel, were arrested in July. Aaron, 31, a U.S. citizen who lives in Moscow and Tel Aviv, remains at large and is the subject of an FBI "wanted" poster. Another defendant, Anthony Murgio, 31, of Tampa, Florida, was charged separately over the bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx. He was originally charged in July, and faces an arraignment on Friday. A co-defendant in that case, Yuri Lebedev, is in "discussions" with prosecutors, Bharara said. Lawyers for the defendants were not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan on Tuesday confirmed that the latest charges relate to the 2014 attack, and said it continues to cooperate with law enforcement efforts to fight cybercrime. It also said that only contact information such as names, addresses and emails was accessed, and that account information, passwords or Social Security numbers were not compromised. E*Trade said it has contacted 31,000 customers who may have been affected. News Corp said the indictment relates to a breach that targeted subscribers, and which was disclosed on Oct. 9.  LIKE DRINKING VODKA The new charges portray Shalon as the ringleader, having orchestrated hackings since 2012 against nine companies, and along with Orenstein having since 2007 run at least 12 illegal Internet casinos. Prosecutors said Shalon and Orenstein also ran payment processors IDPay and Todur, through which they collected $18 million of fees to process hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions for criminals. Shalon was also accused of running the illegal bitcoin exchange Coin.mx with Murgio, and concealing at least $100 million in Swiss and other accounts. Prosecutors said the illegal proceeds included tens of millions of dollars from manipulating the prices of stocks sold to customers whose information had been stolen, and who the defendants arranged to be cold-called. According to prosecutors, Shalon was sure this would work because Americans liked buying stocks. "It\'s like drinking freaking vodka in Russia," he allegedly told an accomplice. Meanwhile, the Atlanta indictment said that after Scottrade\'s computers were breached in late 2013, Shalon expressed a desire in an online chat to see credit card and trade data for customers, so "they will know that we know info about them for real, and they will trust us more." Aaron was identified in the FBI poster as the "front-man" in the scheme where, using the alias "Mike Shields," he conspired to drive up stock prices and dump shares at inflated prices. "Securities fraud on cyber steroids," as Bharara put it. The indictment against Shalon, Orenstein and Aaron includes counts of computer hacking, securities and wire fraud, identity theft, illegal Internet gambling and conspiring to commit money laundering. Not all counts were brought against all defendants. Murgio faces seven counts including wire fraud, money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitter. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously filed civil charges against Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein. The cases are U.S. v. Shalon et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00333; U.S. v. Murgio in the same court, No. 15-cr-00769; and U.S. v.

Gox said on Friday it found\n200,000 "forgotten" bitcoins on March 7, a week after the\nTokyo-based digital currency exchange filed for bankruptcy\nprotection, saying it lost nearly all the 850,000 bitcoins it\nheld, worth some $500 million at today\'s prices. Mt. Gox made the announcement on its website. Online sleuths\nhad noticed around 200,000 bitcoins moving through the\ncrypto-currency exchange after the bankruptcy filing. The exchange, headed by 28-year-old Frenchman Mark Karpeles,\nsaid the bitcoins were found in an old-format online wallet\nwhich it had thought no longer held any bitcoins, but which it\nchecked again after its bankruptcy filing. "On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old\nformat wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance\nof approximately 200,000 BTC," the statement said. It added that it moved the 200,000 bitcoins from online to\noffline wallets on March 14-15 "for security reasons." "These\nbitcoin movements, including the change in the manner in which\nthese coins were stored, had been reported to the court and the\nsupervisor by counsels," it noted. Many of Mt. Gox\'s 127,000 creditors, who feared they had\nlost their investments when the exchange filed for bankruptcy, \nare skeptical about what the exchange has said happened to the\nbitcoins it had. In its bankruptcy filing, Mt. Gox also said $28\nmillion was "missing" from its Japanese bank accounts.    BITCOIN TRACKING On Thursday, a U.S. judge in Chicago overseeing a class\naction against Mt. Gox revised a previous order, allowing some\nof the exchange\'s bitcoin movements to be tracked. "Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the\n180,000 bitcoins, which we\'ve been monitoring. Hours later, Mt.\nGox claimed it "found" these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox\nrealized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned\nthese 180,000-200,000 bitcoins," Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at\nlaw firm Edelson, told Reuters in emailed comments. Edelson is representing Illinois resident Gregory Greene,\nwho proposed the class action over what he claims is a massive\nfraud. Mt. Gox blamed the loss of 750,000 bitcoins belonging to\nits customers and 100,000 of its own on hackers who attacked its\nsoftware.

Gox filed for bankruptcy it was sued by a customer seeking the return of funds in a case that highlights some of the red flags raised in the run-up to the collapse of what was once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange. New York resident Marko Simovic filed a civil action at the Tokyo District Court on December 24, seeking to recover $105,000 he had on deposit at Mt. Gox and about $14,000 in interest, court filings show. Simovic, who described himself as a software developer who previously managed the bitcoin operations for a hedge fund, said Mt. Gox dodged repeated requests to withdraw funds from his account, which as of July 1 was credited with $935,000 in cash. Simovic could not be reached for comment. Mt. Gox refuted Simovic\'s claims in a brief filed by law firm Baker & McKenzie. It said Simovic didn\'t comply with online procedures, and cited withdrawal limits that would have required two months for him to draw down his account. That rebuttal was submitted to the court three weeks before Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection on February 28, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth more than half a billion dollars to hackers. The lawsuit was cited in a U.S. bankruptcy filing earlier this week, which is related to the company\'s Tokyo bankruptcy proceedings. EXIT STRATEGY Simovic said at the time he was worried that Mt. Gox could go bankrupt and decided on an exit strategy: he converted his cash into bitcoin, which he then sold on Bitstamp, a rival exchange. He managed to recoup $833,000, leaving the rest in his Mt. Gox account, according to the lawsuit. "Rather than leave my money at Mt. Gox as required by their expensive, extremely slow and uncertain withdrawal procedure, I decided to move the funds as soon as possible," Simovic wrote in a brief that was part of the court file and dated December 18. "This was the only way I could get my money back quickly. Moreover, I was concerned there might be a run on Mt. Gox." The suit also shows that Simovic raised questions about whether Mt. Gox was complying with Japanese laws. In a September 11 letter to Mt. Gox\'s chief marketing officer Gonzague Gay-Bouchery, Simovic\'s lawyer expressed concern that Mt. Gox may be in violation of investment and banking laws that prohibit unlicensed companies from receiving deposits and engaging in currency exchange services. In a court filing, Mt. Gox said it had checked with Japan\'s Financial Services Agency (FSA) and there was no need for it to register with the banking regulator. No one could be reached at Mt. Gox or Baker & McKenzie for comment. The FSA declined to say whether it had spoken to Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox\'s collapse has brought into focus the question of how to regulate crypto currencies. Japan is still struggling to craft a response. Last week, the government said bitcoin was not legal tender, but might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers\' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers. The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox\'s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox\'s assets. Mt. Gox\'s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit. The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse. "This case involves a massive fraud," said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. "They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse." Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency. An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing. "We don\'t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles," said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper. Mt. Gox\'s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding. The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. Hale\'s order protects Mt. Gox\'s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles. Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7. Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted. Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mt Gox\'s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies\' owners. The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company\'s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies\' activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company. Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means "worthless little symbol" in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States. It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations. Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French. When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox\'s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking. He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing. Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight. The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup. The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver\'s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary. The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who famously accused Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea, said they used bitcoins to buy tickets for a high-altitude voyage on billionaire Richard Branson\'s Virgin Galactic commercial spaceflight venture. The brothers, Olympic rowers who earned MBA degrees from Oxford University, have become bitcoin evangelists and investors and are planning to launch a fund to make it easy to trade the digital currency on the stock market. In a blog post, Tyler Winklevoss compared Branson\'s space endeavor and bitcoin entrepreneurs to major historical figures who changed the way the world was perceived, like Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Nicolaus Copernicus. "It is in this vein that Cameron and I contemplate our tickets into space - as seed capital supporting a new technology that may forever change the way we travel, purchased with a new technology that may forever change the way we transact," he wrote. Virgin Galactic, a U.S. offshoot of Branson\'s London-based Virgin Group, is selling rides on its SpaceShipTwo for $250,000. The twins are not the first to sign up for Virgin Galactic using bitcoins, but it is the highest-profile flight booking to date using the currency. Last November, Branson announced that a flight attendant from Hawaii had become the first person to pay for a seat with bitcoins. Bitcoin, a digital currency that is traded on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control, has seen its value soar in the past year as it gains attention from growing numbers of investors, entrepreneurs and regulators. But the virtual currency\'s struggle for legitimacy has been shaken by recent debacles, including the collapse last week of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\'s dominant bitcoin exchange. Few major retailers have begun accepting payment in bitcoins, and critics say the currency\'s high volatility makes it unsuitable for everyday transactions. The six-passenger, two-pilot SpaceShipTwo is hauled into the air by a twin-hull carrier jet and then released. The upcoming flights are designed to reach altitudes of more than 65 miles above Earth, high enough to see the curvature of the planet set against the blackness of space.

Nine other banks had already signed up to the initiative, which represents the first time banks have collaborated on how the technology that underpins bitcoin - a controversial, web-based "cryptocurrency" - can be used in finance. The other banks announced on Tuesday were Citi, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Commerzbank, Societe Generale, SEB, BNY Mellon, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, taking the total to 22 banks. The consortium is being led by David Rutter, who was formerly CEO of electronic trading at ICAP Electronic Trading, one of the world\'s largest interdealer brokers. The blockchain works as a huge, decentralized ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made, which is verified and shared by a global network of computers and therefore is virtually tamper-proof. The Bank of England has a team dedicated to it and calls it a "key technological innovation".  R3\'s Chief Technology Officer Richard Brown, who joined the company last month from IBM, told Reuters the technology could bring banks significant savings by making their systems more efficient and transparent, with less risk of error.  "Over decades banks and other firms have built systems for themselves ... and then a collection of processes has emerged between the banks ... to make sure these systems are kept synchronized and are reconciled with each other," he said. "With shared or distributed ledgers perhaps we can imagine a world where participants share this infrastructure, so rather than everyone running their own systems that have to be reconciled, we can have ... an open platform that multiple firms can connect to."  Brown also said that given that the likely use of this ledger by banks would be for banking transactions, those would need to be kept private - unlike the bitcoin transactions currently recorded on the blockchain - because customers would not want their details made public.    Deutsche Bank is half-way through testing out whether a corporate bond can be issued on the blockchain and could automatically issue coupons and redeem itself by means of a "smart contract" that automatically executes the terms.   "For me it\'s the combination of tokenization and the smart contract that I think is really revolutionary," said Rhom Ram, who steers Deutsche Bank\'s digital agenda in transaction banking.  "If you get into other asset classes that are dependent on legal contracts, then typically they take a long time to settle. That\'s a massive inefficiency." Ram also said banks\' interest in blockchain technology had grown rapidly in recent months.  "We have been looking at all these developments for at least 18 months now, and for a long time I was talking to myself within the banking community. But definitely within the last five months there is a lot more understanding, interest and momentum."

In a court filing in federal court in Manhattan, a\nprosecutor said Yuri Lebedev, one of two men charged with\noperating the bitcoin exchange service, was in discussions\n"regarding a possible disposition of this case." The filing used language that is usually indicative of plea\ntalks, though cases in some instances can be resolved with\ndeferred prosecution agreements or with charges being dropped. Eun Young Choi, a prosecutor under Manhattan U.S. Attorney\nPreet Bharara who made the submission, said negotiations were\nnot yet complete and sought an extension until Sept. 28 for when\na grand jury would need to indict Lebedev. A federal magistrate judge has granted that request,\naccording to court papers. A spokesman for Bharara declined comment. Mark Bernett,\nLebedev\'s lawyer, did not respond to requests for comment. Should a plea deal be reached, it could be a breakthrough\nfor authorities investigating the hacking of JPMorgan, which \ncompromised information in 83 million household and small\nbusiness accounts. U.S. and Israeli authorities arrested four people in Israel\nand Florida in July in connection with two separate fraud\nschemes. While the cases appeared distinct and made no mention of the\nJPMorgan hacking, a person familiar with the matter said both\nactions stemmed from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\'s\ninvestigation of the cyberattack. In one indictment, U.S. authorities accused Lebedev and\nanother Florida man, Anthony Murgio, of operating an underground\nbitcoin exchange, called Coin.mx, that was used to facilitate\ncriminal activity including cyberattacks. In another indictment, authorities accused three men of\nengaging in a stock manipulation scheme involving U.S. penny\nstocks.

The objective is to allow people to transfer cash or make payments instantaneously without a bank or clearing party being involved, saving on transaction costs. A venture called SETL, led by former Chi-X head Peter Randall and hedge-fund investor Anthony Culligan, said on Monday its blockchain-inspired technology would simultaneously transact real-world currencies or assets and provide a "golden record" of the trade, which takes days on some financial markets. "We want to unlock the power of the blockchain for financial markets," said Randall in an interview. The technology will be regulator-friendly and "permissioned", meaning that participants\' identities can be derived by regulators and auditors if required, he said. With the financial sector under pressure to cut costs and protect profits in the face of post-crisis rules and sluggish markets, investment is pouring into tech-driven approaches such as blockchain to overhaul processes that are costly to maintain. While bitcoin has in the past been viewed with suspicion by many in the financial sector, the industry is now seeing potential from using the technology behind it.

The objective is to allow people to transfer cash or make\npayments instantaneously without a bank or clearing party being\ninvolved, saving on transaction costs. A venture called SETL, led by former Chi-X head Peter\nRandall and hedge-fund investor Anthony Culligan, said on Monday\nits blockchain-inspired technology would simultaneously transact\nreal-world currencies or assets and provide a "golden record" of\nthe trade, which takes days on some financial markets. "We want to unlock the power of the blockchain for financial\nmarkets," said Randall in an interview. The technology will be\nregulator-friendly and "permissioned", meaning that\nparticipants\' identities can be derived by regulators and\nauditors if required, he said. With the financial sector under pressure to cut costs and\nprotect profits in the face of post-crisis rules and sluggish\nmarkets, investment is pouring into tech-driven approaches such\nas blockchain to overhaul processes that are costly to maintain. While bitcoin has in the past been viewed with suspicion by\nmany in the financial sector, the industry is now seeing\npotential from using the technology behind it.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said the databases or "block chains" which record every transaction  ever conducted in such cryptocurrencies were already being used to issue and trade some securities, bypassing regulated stock exchanges and central securities depositories. A block chain shows at any given moment in time who owns how much of the virtual currency, which is not backed by any government or central bank. "ESMA would like to find out more about these market developments and in particular to know to what extent the use of the block chain could enter the financial mainstream, and how it could be used," the watchdog said in a statement. The sector came under regulatory scrutiny after the Silk Road online black market for drugs and other illegal transactions, was closed in 2013. ESMA, due to have powers from 2017 to ban harmful financial products, said it has been monitoring and analyzing virtual currency-based investments for six months. Its "call for evidence" on Wednesday focused on investment schemes, derivatives like options, and contracts-for-difference (CFDs) that are based on a virtual currency or invest in virtual currency-related businesses. It said it is also looking at assets such as shares and funds that are exclusively traded using block chains, and the application of block chain technology inside or outside virtual currencies. Virtual currency-based assets or securities are created and transferred using software that operates on top of the bitcoin block chain. "It is unclear whether and how ownership rights created via a block chain would be enforceable," ESMA said. There is also no reliable information on who owns virtual currency-based financial assets, it added. The watchdog said it had no pre-conceived view as to whether any other regulatory action is needed beyond the call for evidence and had "no immediate plans to take any". It said the largest collective investment scheme has 116 million euros under management, with two regulated companies in Europe offering CFDs in bitcoins and litecoins. Two funds have said they are domiciled in Europe but ESMA said it was "unclear" if that was in fact the case. Eleven of the 17 identified virtual currency exchanges "seem" to be located in Europe, it added in its call for further information from the sector.

He could face life in\nprison if convicted on all counts. But taken on its own, a conviction on the money laundering \ncount would elicit a recommendation for prison time for an\noperation larger than $400 million, as prosecutors originally\nestimated, that would be longer than the recommendation for a\nscheme netting between $400 million and $200 million, or one\njust under $200 million. The specific number of months or years\nrecommended would also depend on other factors such as criminal\nhistory. Ulbricht's lawyer declined to comment. The change in Silk Road's estimated sales volume is not,\nhowever, entirely due to fluctuations in the value of bitcoins,\nwhich have actually increased in price since prosecutors filed\nthe criminal complaint against Ulbricht on Oct. 2, 2013. Back\nthen, one bitcoin was worth $125 but they are trading at around\n$205 today.

Gox bitcoin exchange, Mark Karpeles, may have been the mastermind behind the black market website. Questioning of Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security special agent, showed Ulbricht\'s defense was seeking to cast doubts over the allegation that Ulbricht was Silk Road\'s operator, known as "Dread Pirate Roberts."  Ulbricht\'s lawyer Joshua Dratel pointed to Karpeles, who was CEO of Mt. Gox. The company filed for bankruptcy a year ago after saying it lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of virtual coins. "Our position is he set up Mr. Ulbricht," Dratel said outside jurors\' presence.  Karpeles, who was never charged, denied he had anything to do with Silk Road. "This is probably going to be disappointing for you, but I am not and have never been Dread Pirate Roberts," he said in an email sent to Reuters and other media.  "The investigation reached that conclusion already - this is why I am not the one sitting during the Silk Road trial, and I can only feel defense attorney Joshua Dratel trying everything he can to point the attention away from his client." Dratel, in opening statements on Tuesday, said that while Ulbricht created Silk Road, he handed it off to others and became their "fall guy." Der-Yeghiayan testified on Thursday in Manhattan federal court that as late as August 2013 he believed that Karpeles actually controlled the website, where drugs and illicit goods could be bought anonymously. Under questioning by Ulbricht\'s lawyer, Der-Yeghiayan said that as part of a search warrant for Karpeles\' Google email account he had said there was probable cause to believe he controlled Silk Road. It was not clear from the trial how Der-Yeghiayan\'s views had since changed. He testified on Wednesday that an Internal Revenue Service agent had flagged Ulbricht that September as Dread Pirate Roberts\u2019 possible alter ego.  Silk Road, which took payment in bitcoin, operated from 2011 to October 2013, generating $200 million in drug sales, prosecutors say. Ulbricht, 30, faces seven counts including operating a continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy to commit narcotics trafficking. The investigation of Karpeles was separate from the events leading to the hacking attack on Tokyo-based Mt. Gox last year that led to its filing for bankruptcy. Der-Yeghiayan said that at the time he was investigating Karpeles, investigators theorized Silk Road was operated in part to drive bitcoin prices up. The August 2013 search warrant followed earlier grand jury subpoenas and another search warrant that Der-Yeghiayan said were issued targeting companies linked to Karpeles as part of the Silk Road probe.

Gox CEO as possible Silk Road mastermind: agent'}, {'articleText': u' (Updates with Karpeles comment) By Nate Raymond NEW YORK Jan 15 A U.S. agent investigating Silk\nRoad told jurors at a trial of accused operator Ross Ulbricht\nthat he believed in 2013 that the former chief of the Mt. Gox\nbitcoin exchange, Mark Karpeles, may have been the mastermind\nbehind the black market website. Questioning of Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a U.S. Department of\nHomeland Security special agent, showed Ulbricht\'s defense was\nseeking to cast doubts over the allegation that Ulbricht was\nSilk Road\'s operator, known as "Dread Pirate Roberts." Ulbricht\'s lawyer Joshua Dratel pointed to Karpeles, who was\nCEO of Mt. Gox. The company filed for bankruptcy a year ago\nafter saying it lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of\nvirtual coins. "Our position is he set up Mr. Ulbricht," Dratel said\noutside jurors\' presence. Karpeles, who was never charged, denied he had anything to\ndo with Silk Road. "This is probably going to be disappointing for you, but I\nam not and have never been Dread Pirate Roberts," he said in an\nemail sent to Reuters and other media. "The investigation reached that conclusion already - this is\nwhy I am not the one sitting during the Silk Road trial, and I\ncan only feel defense attorney Joshua Dratel trying everything\nhe can to point the attention away from his client." Dratel, in opening statements on Tuesday, said that while\nUlbricht created Silk Road, he handed it off to others and\nbecame their "fall guy." Der-Yeghiayan testified on Thursday in Manhattan federal\ncourt that as late as August 2013 he believed that Karpeles\nactually controlled the website, where drugs and illicit goods\ncould be bought anonymously. Under questioning by Ulbricht\'s lawyer, Der-Yeghiayan said\nthat as part of a search warrant for Karpeles\' Google email\naccount he had said there was probable cause to believe he\ncontrolled Silk Road. It was not clear from the trial how Der-Yeghiayan\'s views\nhad since changed. He testified on Wednesday that an Internal\nRevenue Service agent had flagged Ulbricht that September as\nDread Pirate Roberts\' possible alter ego. Silk Road, which took payment in bitcoin, operated from 2011\nto October 2013, generating $200 million in drug sales,\nprosecutors say. Ulbricht, 30, faces seven counts including operating a\ncontinuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy to commit\nnarcotics trafficking. The investigation of Karpeles was separate from the events\nleading to the hacking attack on Tokyo-based Mt. Gox last year\nthat led to its filing for bankruptcy. Der-Yeghiayan said that at the time he was investigating\nKarpeles, investigators theorized Silk Road was operated in part\nto drive bitcoin prices up. The August 2013 search warrant followed earlier grand jury\nsubpoenas and another search warrant that Der-Yeghiayan said\nwere issued targeting companies linked to Karpeles as part of\nthe Silk Road probe. But in July 2013, Der-Yeghiayan, who worked in Chicago,\ntestified that over his objections, federal prosecutors in\nBaltimore met with Karpeles as part of an investigation over\nunlicensed money transfers. Exact details of the meeting were unclear and are expected\nto be part of Der-Yeghiayan\'s testimony when trial resumes\nTuesday. Dratel sought to elicit testimony that Karpeles had offered\nto "tell the government who he thought runs Silk Road" to avoid\ncharges. The case is U.S. v.

The six-hour online auction began at 8:00 a.m. EST (1300\nGMT) for nearly $18.6 million worth of bitcoins, and the winning\nbidders will be notified Friday. It was the Marshals Service\'s second such auction following\nan earlier one in June for almost 30,000 bitcoins seized during\nthe Silk Road raid in 2013. To date, the government has recovered 173,991 bitcoins while\npursuing the case, including about 144,336 from computer\nhardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, the alleged creator of the\nunderground website. As part of a civil forfeiture proceeding, Ulbricht and the\ngovernment reached a deal in January in which the bitcoins on\nhis hardware would be sold and the proceeds held, pending the\noutcome of his case. The remaining 94,341 bitcoins from Ulbricht\'s hardware will\nbe auctioned in the coming months. Lynzey Donahue, a Marshals Service spokeswoman, said\nauthorities "didn\'t want to flood the market" with too many\nbitcoins at once. The previous set of 29,655 bitcoins, which were recovered\nfrom Silk Road\'s servers, were won at auction by a single\nbidder, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper. Terms were\nnot disclosed. Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange\nstrategy at CitiFX, wrote in a note ahead of the auction that\nbidders this time "will likely lowball their bids relative to\nthe current market price." "My expectation is that most bids will be aggressively to\nthe downside in the hope of getting a post-Black Friday\nbargain," he wrote. Draper said Wednesday he would be among the bidders\nparticipating in the auction. Others who have said they will bid\nin the auction include the Bitcoin Investment Trust and Pantera\nCapital. Ulbricht, known online as "Dread Pirate Roberts," according\nto prosecutors, faces trial Jan. 5 on charges including\nconspiracy and narcotics trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty.

Las Vegas-based Anthem said it will launch 10 million "INNCoins" backed by 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of gold, with all coins expected to be in circulation by July 2015.  "It should make gold more acceptable as a form of currency by combining its appeal as a store of value and a much more efficient medium of exchange," said Anthem Blanchard, chief executive of Anthem Vault, who previously worked at online precious metals market GoldMoney. Blanchard said Wednesday\'s launch was a promotional offering, and the company has plans to offer a full suite of virtual currencies backed by a larger amount of gold as well as other precious metals at the end of September.

The system reward computers that solve complex mathematical problems by the occasional payoff of new bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin mining. The launch comes at a critical time for online currency markets after the failure of Mt.

The market is also crowded, with Anthem competing against established players, including Namecoin (NMC), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (Doge), Peercoin (PPC) and Mastercoin (MSC).

Ross Ulbricht, who prosecutors said was known online as\n"Dread Pirate Roberts," had claimed he did not conspire with\nSilk Road users who might have broken the law by completing\ntransactions on the now-defunct website, using the digital\ncurrency bitcoin. He also claimed he was not involved in money\nlaundering because bitcoins are not money. In a 51-page decision, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest\nin Manhattan said, "the design and operation" of Silk Road and\nUlbricht\'s role as an "intermediary" between website users\njustified letting prosecutors pursue their case. "The allegations amount to Ulbricht acting as a sort of\n\'godfather\' - determining the territory, the actions which may\nbe undertaken, and the commissions he will retain; disciplining\nothers to stay in line, and generally casting himself as a\nleader," Forrest wrote. "Whether the government can prove the\nfacts alleged is not a question at this stage." Forrest also said the federal money laundering statute\nencompasses bitcoins, noting that the virtual currency\'s value\ncan be expressed in dollars. "Any other reading would - in light\nof Bitcoin\'s\' sole raison d\'etre - be nonsensical," she said.\n"One can money launder using Bitcoin." Ulbricht, 29, faces four conspiracy counts, including\nengaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, narcotics\ntrafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. The criminal\nenterprise count carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. A trial is scheduled for Nov. 3, court records showed.\nUlbricht is in federal custody, following his arrest on Oct. 1\nat a public library in San Francisco. Authorities shut down Silk\nRoad shortly before the arrest. Joshua Dratel, a lawyer for Ulbricht, declined to comment,\nsaying he had not yet reviewed the decision. In seeking to dismiss the indictment, Ulbricht said the\ngovernment portrayed him as being, at most, a "steerer" or\n"facilitator" of alleged illegal conduct, not a co-conspirator. But the judge said the indictment went further, alleging\nthat Silk Road was "specifically and intentionally designed" to\ncreate an "expansive black market" for drugs and malicious\nsoftware and laundering money. She said the allegations, if true, would distinguish Silk\nRoad from websites such as Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc\n, which are intended for buyers and sellers to complete\ntransactions lawfully. Individuals accessed Silk Road with an encryption program\nthat allowed anonymous communications. On June 27, the U.S. Marshals Service auctioned 29,655\nbitcoins, then valued at $17.7 million, seized from Silk Road. Bitcoins are transacted independent of central control, and\nnot backed by any government or central bank. The case is U.S. v.

Gox, once the world\'s biggest\nbitcoin exchange, is likely to be liquidated after a Tokyo court\ndismissed the company\'s bid to resuscitate its business, the\ncourt-appointed administrator said on Wednesday. CEO Mark Karpeles is also likely to be investigated for\nliability in the collapse of the Tokyo-based firm, the\nprovisional administrator, lawyer Nobuaki Kobayashi, said in a\nstatement published on the Mt. Gox website. "The Tokyo District Court recognised that it would be\ndifficult for the company to carry out the civil rehabilitation\nproceedings and dismissed the application for the\ncommencement of the civil rehabilitation proceedings," he said. Mt.

Speaking at an annual DoubleLine event in New York, Gundlach\nsaid: "In Europe, the inflation rate is falling. In the United\nStates ... the inflation rate is lower than it was in 2011." "I continue to believe that there is more deflation in the\nworld than most people appreciate," Gundlach, who helps manage\napproximately $49 billion in assets, said. "We will see\npotentially a deflationary scare again," he added. Gundlach said that the economy will likely face deflation\nonce central banks remove their stimulus programs. The Federal\nReserve last month said it would reduce its monthly bond\npurchases, which have been implemented to spur hiring and\neconomic growth, to $55 billion. The Fed started its stimulus\nprogram in 2012 and continued until December 2013 at an\n$85-billion pace. The central bank has also kept its short-term policy rate\nbetween 0-0.25 percent since the depths of the recession in late\n2008 to help the U.S. economy recover. The European Central\nBank, meanwhile, opened the door on April 3 to turning on its\nmoney-printing presses to boost the euro zone economy and keep\ninflation from staying too low. Gundlach also said that he liked gold and that it was held\nin good strong hands. "I\'m actually sort of fond of gold as a\ndiversifier now," he said, adding however that he isn\'t\nconvinced gold will reach $10,000 an ounce. He reiterated he favored dollar-denominated emerging market\nbonds, and specified that he preferred longer-dated bonds given\npositive long-term economic indicators for emerging market\ncountries. Gundlach again sounded the alarm on China, which he said\ncould see a significant decline in economic growth. "A 23-fold\nincrease in the economy has got to be due for not just a plus 7\n- how about a minus 7", he said in reference to Chinese economic\ngrowth. As for bitcoin, he said the currency is a "failure" now,\ndogged by scandals, security issues as well as volatility. He\nsaid he isn\'t sure it will ultimately be a failure in "version\n4.0."

Yellen delivered the Fed\'s semi-annual Monetary Policy\nReport to the House Financial Services Committee on Feb. 11, but\nher testimony to the Senate panel scheduled for Feb. 13 was\ndelayed because of a winter storm.  YELLEN ON OVERNIGHT FIXED-RATE REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT\nOPERATION "We are engaging in this program, you mentioned this is\nsomething technical, but we want to be able to firmly control\nour short-term money market rates ... When the time ultimately\ncomes, which is probably a long way off, we do want to tighten\nmonetary policy and raise our target for short-term interest\nrates. We would like to be able to execute that in a very smooth\nway so that we have good control over the level of short-term\ninterest rates."  YELLEN ON FORWARD GUIDANCE ON INTEREST RATES "There are many different views on our committee about what\nthe right way is to cast forward guidance ... The unemployment\nrate is not a sufficient statistic for the state of the labor\nmarket. There is no hard-and-fast rule about what unemployment\nrate constitutes full employment and we need to consider a broad\nrange of indicators. Many members of the committee have\nemphasized this point and it\'s one I agree with. It moves in the\ndirection of qualitative guidance. On the other hand, we do want\nto give markets as much of an indication of how we expect to\nconduct policy as we can."  YELLEN ON RATE PAID ON EXCESS RESERVES "I think that lowering that rate would have very limited. It\ngoes in the right direction, but would have a very limited\neffect on bank lending. "We have worried about what impact it would have on money\nmarkets that we operate in, and not wanting to completely\ndisrupt money market activities ... It\'s something that we have\nconsidered and could consider going forward, but there are\nconflicting things that are going on there." YELLEN ON DODD-FRANK FINANCIAL REFORMS "We will, in all of our rule makings, do our best to\nminimize the burden on community banks and will listen very\ncarefully through our contacts at community banks to understand\nwhat the burdens are and to minimize them where we can."  YELLEN ON BITCOIN PROBLEMS "I think it\'s important to understand this is ... taking\nplace entirely outside the banking industry and to the best of\nmy knowledge there is no intersection at all in any way between\nbitcoin and banks the Federal Reserve has the ability to\nsupervise and regulate. So the Federal Reserve simply does not\nhave the authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way."  YELLEN ON CONCERNS EASY MONEY POLICY CAUSED MARKET EXCESSES "We are watching very carefully for the development of any\nsuch excesses. We are very focused on not allowing such a thing\nto happen again ... While there might be a few areas where I\nhave concerns, such as deteriorating underwriting standards in\nleveraged lending, farmland prices, a few things, I don\'t see\nthose excesses having developed at this point. "With respect to housing prices, they have rebounded\nsignificantly, but remain not back to their peak levels by any\nmeans. And price-rent ratios in housing certainly remain in\nnormal ranges. So I don\'t think we have promoted excesses,\ncertainly not at this stage."  YELLEN ON RAISING MINIMUM WAGE "There\'s considerable debate about just what the employment\nimpact of this would be. CBO (Congressional Budget Office) is\nqualified as anyone to evaluate that literature and I wouldn\'t\nwant to argue with their assessment. I mean, there are a range\nof studies and they cited them, but I wouldn\'t want to argue\nwith (them). They\'re good at this kind of evaluation ... I think\nthey also ... indicated that a large number of individuals would\nsee their incomes raised as a consequence."  YELLEN ON CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AT BIGGEST BANKS "This is high on our regulatory agenda with this coming\nyear. We have out an initial proposal on this. I can\'t give you\nan exact time. We will certainly be working with the other\nagencies to finalize it.  YELLEN ON HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE ECONOMY TO NORMALIZE "Several years, I think."  YELLEN ON REACHING FULL EMPLOYMENT "To me it is the state of the job market in which people are\nable to find, in a reasonable period of time, jobs for which\nthey are qualified and there is no single metric that would\nenable me to tell you when we will reach that."  YELLEN ON REGULATIONS FOR \'TOO-BIG-TO-FAIL\' FIRMS "I\'m slightly surprised that he (Fed Board Governor Daniel\nTarullo) said we are \'nowhere close\' (on resolving\ntoo-big-to-fail) because I personally think we\'ve made quite a\nlot of progress in putting in place regulations that will make a\nhuge differences to this....  YELLEN ON POTENTIAL INSTABILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS "I agree that an environment of low rates ... and we have\nhad a long period of low interest rates ... can give rise to\nbehavior that poses threats to financial stability and therefore\nwe need to be looking at that very carefully and we are doing so\nin a very thorough way, I believe."  YELLEN ON MONITORING ASSET PRICES, LEVERAGE AND CREDIT\nGROWTH "There are a number of things that we are monitoring:\nmeasures of asset prices and whether or not they appear to be\ndiverging from historical norms ... We\'re looking at leverage\nwhich builds up and leverage can be very dangerous to the\nfinancial system ... We\'re looking at credit growth to see\nwhether or not that has potential worrisome trends ... In\naddition to that, we\'re looking particularly to our stress tests\nat financial institutions. In a low-interest rate environment we\nhave to worry about whether or not they\'re appropriately dealing\nwith interest rate risk."  YELLEN ON UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, LEVERAGED LENDING, OTHER\nCONCERNS "I would say at this stage I don\'t see concerns but there\nare pockets of a few things that we\'ve identified that do\nconcern us. For example, underwriting standards and leveraged\nlending clearly appear to be deteriorating. We have addressed\nthat with supervisory guidance and special exams and will\ncontinue to be very vigilant in that area ... There are a few\nareas within asset price valuations, broadly speaking. I\nwouldn\'t worry but there are a few areas where I would be\nconcerned. Many people have emphasized farmland as a concern,\nfarmland prices."  YELLEN ON ASSET PURCHASES "Asset purchases are not on a preset course. If there is a\nsignificant change in the outlook, certainly we would be open to\nreconsidering, but I wouldn\'t want to jump to conclusions here."  YELLEN ON FED\'S 6.5 PERCENT JOBLESS RATE THRESHOLD "Six-and-a-half percent unemployment is not the\n(policy-setting) committee\'s definition of what constitutes full\nemployment. The range of views on that among committee members\nis substantially lower ... The unemployment rate is not a\nsufficient statistic to measure the health of the labor market.\nAn additional 5 percent, an unusually high fraction of our labor\nforce, is working part time for economic reasons ... and we have\nan unusually high fraction of Americans who are unemployed and\nhave been for substantial amounts of times. So, as we go to\nfuller consideration how is the labor market performing, we need\nto take all of those things into account."  YELLEN ON GSE REFORM "I strongly support, and would urge the Congress to address\nthe issue of GSE (government sponsored enterprise) reform. We\'ve\ngotten a mortgage system that in a way remains very highly\ndependent on government backing and it fails to meet the very\nimportant objective of successful securitization without\nsystemic risk."  YELLEN ON FISCAL DRAG "Fiscal policy really has been quite tight and has imposed a\nsubstantial drag on spending in the U.S. economy over the last\nseveral years ... The drag is likely to lessen substantially\nduring the current year, but nevertheless there remains some\ndrag. Of course it is true that because there has been fiscal\npolicy drag the burden on monetary policy has been larger."  YELLEN ON ECONOMIC RECOVERY "I do think the economy is beginning to recover and we have\nmade progress. And in the minimum, I would hope fiscal policy\nwould do no harm."  YELLEN ON MONETARY POLICY "We see accommodative monetary policy as remaining\nappropriate for quite some time. There\'s no conflict at all at\nthe moment between the two goals the Congress has assigned to us\nof promoting maximum employment and price stability."  YELLEN ON RULES FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES "We are looking very carefully to design an appropriate set\nof rules for companies with important involvement in insurance\nto recognize that there are very significant differences between\nthe business models of insurance companies and the banks that\nsupervise and we are taking the time that is necessary to\nunderstand those differences and to attempt to craft a set of\ncapital and liquidity requirements that will be appropriate to\nthe business models of insurance companies."  YELLEN ON RECENT SOFTNESS IN ECONOMIC DATA "Since my appearance before the House committee, a number of\ndata releases have pointed to softer spending than many analysts\nhave expected. Part of that softness may reflect adverse weather\nconditions, but at this point it\'s difficult to discern exactly\nhow much. In the weeks and months ahead, my colleagues and I\nwill be attentive to signals that indicate whether the recovery\nis progressing in line with our earlier expectations."', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0LV1HP20140227', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 27, 12, 27), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"HIGHLIGHTS-Fed chief Yellen's testimony to U.S. Senate committee"}, {'articleText': u" Editor: Malcolm Davidson                 +44 20 7542 6958 Global Picture Desk:                + 65 6870 3775 Global Graphics Desk:                    + 65 6870 3595  (All times GMT / ET) Receive this schedule by email: mediaexpress.reuters.com  TOP STORIES Stocks cruise high altitude, yuan drops most in 3 years LONDON - World shares are at a 6-year high courtesy of a\nrecord peak on Wall Street, while moves by China to stamp out\neasy betting on the yuan triggers its biggest drop in over three\nyears.

Robert Hockett, a Fed fellow and Cornell University Law School professor, said U.S. income inequality has been the leading cause of financial market bubbles and crashes, while Pascal Blanque of Amundi said he is cautious toward emerging markets. Those were some of the highlights from Day 3 of the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, where investors and market specialists shared their best ideas on topics such as the impact of the Fed\'s easy money policies and the best investment plays in 2014. DEEPAK NARULA, founder of Metacapital Narula said his firm has taken more risk in commercial mortgage-backed securities rather than residential mortgage-backed securities, which he said are priced too high. "The easy money in subprime has been made," Narula said. Narula said the Fed\'s program of buying $85 billion in Treasuries and agency mortgages monthly has ramped up prices on agency mortgage debt, creating opportunities for "short" bets against those securities. He also said that outsized returns like the 41.25 percent gain in his Metacapital Mortgage Opportunities Fund in 2012 were not likely to be repeated. "Absent some large shock to the system, those kind of returns are really history." He said next year will be more challenging for investors than 2013 because "there\'s much greater uncertainty around how the Fed will behave." JASON ADER, founder of Spring Owl Asset Management Ader said the Fed is not likely to begin scaling back its bond-buying program next year, and that he personally bought the virtual currency bitcoin after the threat emerged that Cyprus could default on its debt. "I don\'t think you\'ll see tapering next year," Ader said. Ader said he bought bitcoin when it was trading around $120, and that he still owns it. Bitcoin surged over 27 percent to a new high of $675 on Monday ahead of a U.S. government hearing on possible regulation of the digital currency. Ader, who said he typically takes an activist role toward small- and mid-cap companies, said he seeks a "constructive" rather than a hostile approach. "Proxy contests are expensive, time-consuming, and I view it as a tool of last resort," he said. He said his favorite equity play was Strategic Hotels and Resorts Inc. PASCAL BLANQUE, chief investment officer of Amundi Blanque said he was reluctant to invest broadly in emerging markets given sluggish growth and weak corporate earnings in those economies. "It\'s too soon to come back aggressively into emerging equities," Blanque said at the Reuters office in London. He said he was selective on emerging markets going into 2014. "The contribution of emerging economies to global growth will stop next year. But ... my message is don\'t throw the baby out with the bathwater. You\'ve got to discriminate and remap." ROBERT HOCKETT, Fed fellow and Cornell Law professor Hockett said wealth inequality in the United States is the main culprit in the overpricing and crash of financial markets. "It renders financial bubbles and ensuing busts," he said. He also said he was skeptical of investor attempts to take the insurance businesses of mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac private. "I\'m definitely suspicious of the idea of just selling them to a hedge fund," Hockett said. DIDIER SAINT-GEORGES, member of the investment committee at Carmignac Gestion Japanese stocks are appealing, with the market\'s storming rally this year lagging corporate performance, Saint-Georges said at the Reuters office in London. While Japanese equities have risen by around 45 percent this year, earnings have increased by about 60 percent, Saint-Georges said. "If Abenomics continues to deliver ... at these levels Japanese equities remain very attractive. We definitely want to keep a strong position there." CHRIS DELONG, chief investment officer of Taconic DeLong said he was cautious on emerging markets, where he said investors were chasing yield. "We\'re not particularly bullish on emerging markets right now," DeLong said. "In the last five years, the amount of EM corporate debt has more than doubled, probably more than 150 percent, but if you look at liquidity it hasn\'t moved at all" he said.

"Many are still struggling with implementing appropriate\nanti-money laundering, know-your-customer and customer due\ndiligence programs," said Mythili Raman, the acting assistant\nattorney general for the Justice Department\'s Criminal Division,\nin prepared testimony before a U.S. Senate panel. "As members of the U.S. financial community, virtual\ncurrency services can and must safeguard themselves from\nexploitation by criminals and terrorists by implementing legally\nrequired anti-money laundering and know-your-customer controls." Raman will appear alongside top officials from the Secret\nService and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network before the\nSenate Homeland Security Committee on Monday, when they will\nanswer questions about the growing use of digital currencies\nsuch as Bitcoin, and whether the government is doing enough to\npolice the market. Virtual currencies or digital cash have increasingly become\na popular new way to purchase goods or services. They are not regulated or issued by a central bank. They\nhave been touted by some as an alternative currency in countries\nfacing financial instability. The most popular virtual currency is Bitcoin, which exists\nthrough an open-source software program and whose supply is\ncontrolled by a computer algorithm. But critics have raised concerns about a lack of regulatory\noversight over virtual currencies and the fact that some of them\ncan be transferred anonymously, raising fears that they could be\nused by scam artists. Over the past year, U.S. authorities have taken action\nagainst several players in the digital currency space. In May, U.S. authorities seized two accounts linked to the\nTokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, the major operator for the Bitcoin\ndigital marketplace, after it failed to register with FinCEN.

It\'s the latest initiative in an emerging fitness economy that includes all manner of monitoring devices, apps that reward activity with vouchers and even experiments in offering cheap insurance to people who can demonstrate they exercise. Sweatcoin aims to differentiate itself by using complex software to measure movement and location to prevent cheating, and by using the technology behind virtual currency bitcoin to manage transactions.  Retailers, health insurers and corporate wellness managers are taking notice, according to Oleg Fomenko, one of the serial, London-based Russian entrepreneurs who founded Sweatcoin. "This whole business is pegged to making movement valuable," he told Reuters. "Eventually, sweatcoin is going to have a rate of exchange tied to the British pound." Sweatcoin, available in Britain in Apple\'s app store with an Android app to follow in months, offers one coin for every 1,000 steps. Within weeks users can have enough to exchange for fitness products or services in its marketplace.  Rewards include Vivobarefoot running shoes, Kymira infra-red clothing and fitness classes from Wonderush or BOOMCycle.  The company has signed up four London start-ups to offer Sweatcoin as part of an employee rewards program that will offer extra days off, subsidized healthy meals or free massages for sweatcoins they accumulate through activity. Fomenko said his company had talked to all the major health insurers but must prove it can attract users before it can hope to sign commercial deals to use Sweatcoin metrics as a way of calculating health risks and potentially lowering policy premiums for verified physical activity. If Sweatcoin succeeds, the long-term idea is that insurers or employers might pay to take sweatcoins off the market as a reward to users for their physical activity. "Right now, movement is valued at zero," Fomenko said. "How much value a sweatcoin will have will be a market decision but we know it\'s not zero." There will be competition. Another British start-up, Bitwalking, is also seeking to launch its own digital currency. \xa0\xa0\xa0 But Sweatcoin is confident in its software, which is carefully calibrated to prevent slouchers from faking activity by cross-checking data on activity and location to verify steps. Most rival apps rely simply on user-reported information. The company is also developing a proprietary version of blockchain anti-tampering technology to manage the distribution of its currency, akin to how bitcoin transactions work.  It\'s an elaborate second act for Fomenko, whose last start-up, Bloom.fm, a UK music app launched in 2013, drew 1.3 million downloads before imploding when its sole investor, a unit of Gazprom Media, pulled out after Russia\'s invasion of Crimea and he failed to find fresh funding. \xa0\xa0\xa0 Depressed by his failure, Fomenko said he started studying blockchain technology. Meanwhile, his friend and fellow Sweatcoin founder, Anton Derlyatka, was getting going on a fitness start-up. \xa0\xa0\xa0 The epiphany came when the two went for a run. "I got my buzz back," Fomenko said. The question they asked themselves was what could motivate them to sustain that feeling.  \xa0\xa0\xa0 This time round, Fomenko is taking money from a diverse set of London start-up investors and undisclosed music industry heavyweights. Sweatcoin has raised 610,000 pounds ($890,000). \xa0\xa0\xa0 It has also landed a small grant and promotional support from London Sport, an arm of the Greater London Authority that outgoing Mayor Boris Johnson has pushed to encourage Londoners to become more active. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Its two other co-founders are Egor Khmelev and Danil Perushev. Each previously sold their firms to Dream Industries, a Moscow-based start-up technology holding company. Perushev has moved to San Francisco with the aim of  expanding Sweatcoin into the United States in the coming year.     \xa0\xa0\xa0    (Editing by Mark Potter)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Eric Auchard'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XW193', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 5, 5, 9, 7), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'New Apple app launches in Britain that pays people to get fit'}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/global-markets-forum/2014/04/14/gmf-on-the-road-imfworld-bank-springs-meetings-2014/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/01/30/when-disruption-meets-regulation/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' * HP, Apple lead tech sector\'s gains * U.S. jobless claims fall, signaling better labor market * Consumer sentiment, regional manufacturing top forecasts * Dow up 0.1 pct; S&P 500 up 0.1 pct; Nasdaq up 0.5 pct By Angela Moon NEW YORK, Nov 27 The Nasdaq advanced on\nWednesday to its highest level since September 2000 as\nHewlett-Packard lifted the tech sector a day after the company\'s\nearnings. The Dow and the S&P 500 were little changed by midday trade,\ntrimming earlier gains that were driven by a batch of positive\neconomic reports. Overall trading volume was light, with many traders out for\nthe Thanksgiving holiday. The U.S. stock market will be closed\non Thursday. Regular trading will finish early at 1 p.m. (1800\nGMT) on Friday. Big tech names were among the day\'s top gainers. Apple Inc\n shares rose 2.1 percent to $544.41. Hewlett-Packard\'s\nstock jumped 9.5 percent to $27.47 a day after the\ncompany reported better-than-expected results. Wall Street has soared this year, largely on expectations of\ncontinued stimulus from the Federal Reserve. Both the Dow and\nthe S&P 500 have risen more than 20 percent in 2013, hitting a\nseries of all-time highs, while the Nasdaq closed above 4,000\nfor the first time since 2000 on Tuesday. "It may be too complacent not to expect a correction or a\npullback (with indexes) at these levels, but if you look at the\nsetbacks in 2013, they\'ve served as an opportunity to get into a\nstronger bull market," said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic\nstrategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.10 points,\nor 0.06 percent, at 16,081.90. The Standard & Poor\'s 500 Index \n was up 2.29 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,805.04. The\nNasdaq Composite Index  was up 19.274 points, or 0.48\npercent, at 4,037.023. The Nasdaq earlier hit an intraday high\nat 4,039.861, its highest since September 2000. Energy shares were the day\'s worst-performing sector. The\nS&P index of energy shares fell 0.9 percent as Brent oil\nfutures dropped on a higher-than-expected increase in U.S. crude\noil inventories. Newfield Exploration shares fell 4.7 percent to\n$28.11 while Noble Energy slid 5 percent to\n$69.51. The holiday shopping season unofficially begins on Friday,\nand there has already been unprecedented price-cutting from the \ndiscount chain Wal-Mart Stores Inc as well as\nearlier-than-usual deals from online company Amazon.com Inc\n and price-match promises from Best Buy Co Inc \nand Target Corp. The S&P retail index rose 0.4\npercent. But short sellers seemed to be targeting the retail sector,\naccording to SunGard\'s Astec Analytics. "Ahead of Black Friday, short sellers in the U.S. seem to be\nholding some skepticism in the retail sector, hinting at\nconcerns over the gift-buying season. The number of U.S. retail\nequity shares being borrowed, a proxy for short selling, is\nseeing a late surge," said Karl Loomes, market analyst at\nSunGard\'s Astec Analytics, in a client note. But he noted that Macy\'s Inc and Sears Holding\n were the two exceptions, with the number of shares\nborrowed falling 13 percent and 6 percent, respectively, for the\nlast seven days. Among the data that increased optimism about the pace of\nglobal growth, weekly jobless claims for unemployment benefits\nunexpectedly fell in the latest week, a sign of steady\nimprovement in the labor market. Analysts were expecting a rise\nin claims. The November Chicago Purchasing Managers Index and the final\nNovember reading for the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan \nconsumer sentiment index also exceeded expectations, indicating\nthat conditions continue to improve. The price of the digital currency bitcoin soared above\n$1,000 for the first time on Wednesday, extending a surge this\nmonth after a U.S. Senate committee\'s hearing on virtual\ncurrencies.

A blockchain works as a decentralized ledger that is verified and shared by a network of computers, and can be used to record data as well as to secure and validate an exchange of assets, such as currencies or commodities.  Banks and other financial institutions are increasingly investing in blockchain technology, reckoning it could cut their costs and make their operations faster and more transparent.  Cabinet Office Minister Matt Hancock said the government was examining how the technology could be used to manage and keep track of the distribution of public money, such as grants and student loans, saying it could "foster a new culture of trust".   "Government cannot bury its head in the sand and ignore new technologies as they emerge," Hancock, who holds the post of paymaster general, said a blockchain networking event in London.  "That is partly what happened in the past in government with the web ... We cannot let (that) happen again by standing still." Britain has had a patchy record with government IT systems. Previous IT problems have hit the passport agency, the tax credit system and most notably the National Health Service which was forced in 2011 to announce the abandonment of a multi-billion pound scheme to computerize every patient record.         Hancock cautioned against getting too caught up in the hype.  "Blockchain technology is not going to solve every problem; it\'s not going to work in every context," he said.  It is still early days for blockchain: The original bitcoin blockchain was started just over seven years ago, and most financiers and technologists reckon the technology will not be adopted broadly for another five to 10. Many compare the current level of development to the early days of the Internet.  Earlier this year, the government\'s chief scientific adviser urged the government to explore how it could use blockchain. The Bank of England has called it a "key technological innovation", and has a team working on ways that it could be used, such as for issuing central bank money.

When hackers set out to extort the town of Tewksbury, Massachusetts with "ransomware," they followed up with an FAQ explaining the attack and easy instructions for online payment.  After balking for several days, Tewksbury officials decided that paying the modest ransom of about $600 was better than struggling to unlock its own systems, said police chief Timothy Sheehan. That case and others show how cyber-criminals have professionalized ransomware schemes, borrowing tactics from customer service or marketing, law enforcement officials and security firms say. Some players in the booming underworld employ graphic artists, call centers and technical support to streamline payment and data recovery, according to security firms that advise businesses on hacking threats. The advancements, along with modest ransom demands, make it easier to pay than fight. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect business model, as long as you overlook the fact that they are doing something awful,\u201d said James Trombly, president of Delphi Technology Solutions, a Lawrence, Massachusetts, computer services firm that helped three clients over the past year pay ransoms in bitcoin, the virtual currency. He declined to identify the clients. Ransomware victims reported total costs from such attacks of $209 million in the first three months of this year, the FBI said, citing a tally of complaints it has received. That\'s up dramatically from $24 million for all of 2015. Costs for victims, beyond ransom, can include large bills for technical support, consultants and security software.  In the December 2014 attack on Tewksbury, the pressure to pay took on a special urgency because hackers disabled emergency systems. That same is true of additional attacks on police departments and hospitals since then. But all sectors of government and business are targeted, along with individuals, security firms said. Some operations hire underground call centers or email-response groups to walk victims through paying and restoring their data, said Lance James, chief scientist with the cyber-intelligence firm Flashpoint. Graphic artists and translators craft clear ransom demands and instructions in multiple languages. They use geolocation to make sure that victims in Italy get the Italian version, said Alex Holden, chief information security officer with Hold Security. While ransomware attacks have been around longer than a decade, security experts say they\'ve become far more threatening and prevalent in recent years because of state-of-the-art encryption, modules that infect backup systems, and the ability to infect large numbers of computers over a single network. Law enforcement officials have long advised victims against paying ransoms. Paying ransoms is "supporting the business model," encouraging more criminals to become extortionists, said Will Bales, a supervisory special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  But Bales, who helps run ransomware investigations nationwide from the Washington, DC office, acknowledged that the payoffs make economic sense for many victims. "It is a business decision for the victim to make," he said. Run-of-the-mill ransomware attacks typically seek 1 bitcoin, now worth about $420, which is about the same as the hourly rate that some security consultants charge to respond to such incidents, according to security firms who investigate ransomware cases. Some attacks seek more, as when hackers forced Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles to pay $17,000 to end an outage in February.  Such publicized incidents will breed more attacks, said California State Senator Robert Hertzberg, who in February introduced legislation to make a ransomware schemes punishable by up to four years in prison.

Line, a subsidiary of South Korea's Naver Corp, said in a statement on its website that it was under investigation as part of a routine check on issuers of prepaid means of payment, such as tokens used in smartphone games. The Kanto Local Finance Bureau was investigating whether Line had violated Japan's fund settlement law over the handling of customers' money used to buy game tokens, said the person with knowledge of the raid, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The investigation is at an early stage, the person said. If found in violation, the company will be given time to comply, after which penalties such as a business suspension order or improvement order were possible, the person said. Online games and apps that use prepaid tokens as means of in-game payment are popular in Japan. Funds raised from prepaid tokens used as currencies must be reported, and companies are obliged to park half of customers' total unused deposits of over $90,620 with the Legal Affairs Bureau. A Line spokesman said it did not park any funds from a kind of token bought for its 'Key to the Treasure Box' game because it did not consider that particular token to be a currency, and as such not subject to reporting requirements. Line does report funds from other kinds of tokens within the same game, the spokesman said. Naver could not be immediately reached for comment. Shares in the parent closed down 0.5 percent in early afternoon trade versus a 0.4 percent rise in the benchmark index. The news comes as Line, Japan's largest messaging app with 68 million registered users, eyes an initial public offering. The company put plans for a listing on hold in August, saying it would wait until its earnings and market conditions improve. Chief Executive Takeshi Idezawa last month said a listing was still an option. Japanese regulators and companies have struggled with how to define and handle virtual currencies after the high-profile collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange in 2014, when hackers stole an estimated $650 million worth of the digital currency. But new rules on virtual currencies currently passing through parliament are set to make Japan one of the first countries to regulate currencies such as bitcoin at a national level, a moved welcomed by so-called fintech-related investors and companies.

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which met in Tokyo on Thursday, has agreed on a framework for categorizing different components of fintech and assessing their potential risks. The FSB, made up of central bankers, regulators and finance ministry officials from the Group of 20 economies, is looking at fintech partly in response to uncertainty over whether it will "disrupt" traditional banking. Some big investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, are already investing heavily in fintech to avoid missing out. Analysts at Citi said this month that investment in fintech had grown from $1.8 billion in 2010 to $19 billion last year, mostly in payments systems. Citi said the "tipping point" for disruption (for banks) was not far away in the United States and Europe, and had already been reached in China where fintech companies have as many, if not more customers than the major banks. FSB Chairman and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told a news conference broadcast from Tokyo on Thursday that the FSB did not have fundamental concerns about fintech and members wanted to look for opportunities to apply it. "The important thing for us as members of the FSB is to be moving in parallel with these developments and not be stifling innovation, but being able to apply them in a way that improves the resilience of the system," Carney said. He said policy intervention by other authorities such as in competition, conduct and consumer protection, would need come before any financial stability considerations. Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, is used to underpin the web-based currency bitcoin but could have a wide range of other uses, including settling securities transactions, where legal ownership is exchanged for cash. Carney said there was potential to free up some capital requirements for institutions because settlement would be in real time as opposed to delayed. "That has to be weighed against potential operational risk," he said. Michael Bodson, president and chief executive of DTCC, the U.S. securities clearing and settlement company, said on Tuesday that regulators needed to have a strong voice in how blockchain is developed in markets to ensure financial stability is protected.

Ransomware, which involves encrypting a target\'s computer files and then demanding payment to unlock them, has generally been considered the domain of run-of-the-mill cyber criminals. But executives of the security firms have seen a level of sophistication in at least a half dozen cases over the last three months akin to those used in state-sponsored attacks, including techniques to gain entry and move around the networks, as well as the software used to manage intrusions.  "It is obviously a group of skilled of operators that have some amount of experience conducting intrusions," said Phil Burdette, who heads an incident response team at Dell SecureWorks.  Burdette said his team was called in on three cases in as many months where hackers spread ransomware after exploiting known vulnerabilities in application servers. From there, the hackers tricked more than 100 computers in each of the companies into installing the malicious programs.  The victims included a transportation company and a technology firm that had 30 percent of its machines captured. Security firms Attack Research, InGuardians and G-C Partners, said they had separately investigated three other similar ransomware attacks since December. Although they cannot be positive, the companies concluded that all were the work of a known advanced threat group from China, Attack Research Chief Executive Val Smith told Reuters. The ransomware attacks have not previously been reported. None of the companies that were victims of the hackers agreed to be identified publicly. Asked about the allegations, China\'s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that if they were made with a "serious attitude" and reliable proof, China would treat the matter seriously.  But ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China did not have time to respond to what he called "rumors and speculation" about the country\'s online activities. The security companies investigating the advanced ransomware intrusions have various theories about what is behind them, but they do not have proof and they have not come to any firm conclusions. Most of the theories flow from the possibility that the Chinese government has reduced its support for economic espionage, which it pledged to oppose in an agreement with the United States late last year. Some U.S. companies have reported a decline in Chinese hacking since the agreement.  Smith said some government hackers or contractors could be out of work or with reduced work and looking to supplement their income via ransomware. It is also possible, Burdette said, that companies which had been penetrated for trade secrets or other reasons in the past were now being abandoned as China backs away, and that spies or their associates were taking as much as they could on the way out. In one of Dell\'s cases, the means of access by the team spreading ransomware was established in 2013. The cyber security experts could not completely rule out more prosaic explanations, such as the possibility that ordinary criminals had improved their skills and bought tools previously used only by governments. Dell said that some of the malicious software had been associated by other security firms with a group dubbed Codoso, which has a record of years of attacks of interest to the Chinese government, including those on U.S. defense companies and sites that draw Chinese minorities.  PAYMENT IN BITCOIN Ransomware has been around for years, spread by some of the same people that previously installed fake antivirus programs on home computers and badgered the victims into paying to remove imaginary threats.  In the past two years, better encryption techniques have often made it impossible for victims to regain access to their files without cooperation from the hackers. Many ransomware payments are made in the virtual currency Bitcoin and remain secret, but institutions including a Los Angeles hospital have  gone public about ransomware attacks. Ransomware operators generally set modest prices that many victims are willing to pay, and they usually do decrypt the files, which ensures that victims will post positively online about the transaction, making the next victims who research their predicament more willing to pay. Security software companies have warned that because the aggregate payoffs for ransomware gangs are increasing, more criminals will shift to it from credit card theft and other complicated scams.  The involvement of more sophisticated hackers also promises to intensify the threat. InGuardians CEO Jimmy Alderson said one of the cases his company investigated appeared to have been launched with online credentials stolen six months earlier in a suspected espionage hack of the sort typically called an Advanced Persistent Threat, or APT. "The tactics of getting access to these networks are APT tactics, but instead of going further in to sit and listen stealthily, they are used for smash-and-grab," Alderson said.

"These alliances will accelerate innovation, drive growth and broaden our reach in different segments across the world," said Blythe Masters, chief executive officer at Digital Asset holdings and a former JP Morgan investment banker. The blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, is a digital tool for recording and verifying transactions. The technology makes it easier to create cost-efficient business networks without requiring central control. The partnerships show how the financial services industry is exploring the potential of the blockchain. In 2015, there was an explosion of interest in the bitcoin technology as a way to solve inefficiencies in financial markets.  The blockchain is also referred to as a distributed ledger. Digital Asset Holdings, in its statement, referred to itself as a provider of distributed ledger technology. Technology services provider Accenture will provide consulting and systems integration services - ranging from feasibility studies, business case assessments to operating model design - for clients through collaboration on blockchain-related work at global financial institutions, the statement said. Broadridge will help identify, develop and drive adoption of business use cases of the blockchain, while PwC will help educate Digital Asset\'s clients on its technology. "We believe that our partnership with Digital Asset and blockchain solutions demonstrates PwC\'s commitment to providing our global clients with what the markets are demanding," said Haskell S.

Using cryptographic algorithms including digital signatures, blockchain keeps track of and verifies transactions, adding new  transactions in blocks to the chain of all previous transactions. This electronic ledger can be shared across a network but records of the transactions already verified cannot be tampered with or revised.

"As regulators we need to be managing the change without killing it," he said.

But politicians in countries with major financial centers like Britain, Singapore and the United States also don\'t want them falling behind in adopting new technology to secure jobs and tax revenues. And any problems on the way could be a catalyst for regulatory change, though the U.S. Treasury stopped short of proposing new rules after irregularities surrounding $22 million in loans at peer-to-peer lender Lending Club Corp this month (LC.N). Meanwhile China, which is investing heavily in fintech has been grappling with a series of peer-to-peer lending scams that have seen investors defrauded of billions of dollars. "The\xa0 more we can help key decision-makers and regulators just simply even understand what\'s being developed, it\'s going to be hugely important as they can provide the appropriate measures to make sure we don\'t have systemic risk issues," said Alex Scandurra, chief executive of Stone & Chalk, the Australian fintech development hub in Sydney. "Taking China out of the picture, I\'d laugh at anyone who says fintech is posing right now any material risk in any market," Scandurra said. The widespread use of blockchain in trade finance or clearing and settling trades is typically viewed as being five to 10 years away from mainstream adoption.

The Kanto Local Finance Bureau judged that the tokens used in the game are a "prepaid form of payment" and that Line  breached Japan\'s fund settlement law by failing to notify authorities about money deposited for a kind of token used in one of its games, the sources said. Line is a subsidiary of South Korea\'s Naver Corp. The sources declined to be named because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. Under Japanese law, funds raised from prepaid tokens used as currencies must be reported to the authorities, with companies obliged to park half of customers\' total unused deposits of over 10 million yen ($91,500) with a division of the Justice Ministry. Line has told the regulator it will pay the deposit shortfall, the Mainichi newspaper reported, citing an unnamed source. Line had at the end of March a shortfall of unpaid deposits of around 12.5 billion yen ($114 million), the Mainichi said. Asked about the figures and the regulator\'s findings, Line spokesman Icho Saito said regulators had requested it did not disclose the results of the investigation. "We will respond in good faith to the Bureau\'s instructions," Saito said. It was not immediately clear if any other action is being taken against Line. Kanto Local Finance Bureau spokesman Takamasa Kyono declined to comment on individual cases. Online games and apps that use prepaid tokens as means of in-game payment are popular in Japan. But regulators and companies have struggled with how to define and handle virtual currencies after the high-profile collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange in 2014. Line said last month regulators had raided its offices as part of a routine investigation. A source told Reuters the raid was over the handling of customers\' money used to buy payment tokens. Line did not park funds from the token because it did not consider it a currency and as such not subject to reporting requirements, it said. Naver Corp shares were down 0.6 percent in midmorning trade Wednesday versus a 0.7 drop in the benchmark index. Line, Japan\'s largest messaging app with 68 million registered users, has been mulling an initial public offering. Last August it put plans on hold, but its chief said in March it is still considering an IPO.

Yuri Lebedev, 37, pleaded not guilty on Friday to a one-count indictment filed last week in Manhattan federal court, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said on Monday. Lebedev was arrested in July along with a Florida man, Anthony Murgio, for engaging in a conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Murgio was indicted on Nov. 10 when prosecutors unveiled related charges against three men accused of running a sprawling computer hacking and fraud scheme. Prosecutors said two Israelis, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, and an American, Joshua Samuel Aaron, ran a criminal enterprise that hacked into a dozen companies' networks, stealing personal information of over 100 million people.  The companies included JPMorgan, which prosecutors said had records stolen belonging to more than 83 million customers. Lebedev, a resident of Jacksonville, Florida, was not accused of engaging in the hacking offenses or many of the related alleged crimes they helped facilitate, including a series of stock manipulation frauds. But prosecutors previously said he supervised the computer programming functions of an unlicensed bitcoin exchange operated by Murgio and owned by Shalon called Coin.mx that exchanged millions of dollars of the virtual currency for customers. Prosecutors said Murgio as part of the scheme obtained beneficial control of a New Jersey-based federal credit union and installed individuals on the board including Lebedev.  The indictment against Lebedev, made public Dec. 2, said he participated in a conspiracy to make corrupt payments to a senior executive at the credit union in order to gain control over it. The credit union was Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, which federal regulators liquidated last month. A lawyer for Lebedev did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. The case is U.S. v. Lebedev, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.

Yao Yudong, head of the People Bank of China\'s Research\nInstitute of Finance and Banking, said in a column in the\nstate-backed Shanghai Securities News that the eSDR - the\nelectronic version of the IMF\'s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) -\nwould help address flaws in the current global monetary system. Additionally, the role of the SDR should be expanded, Yao\nsaid, echoing suggestions made by central bank governor Zhou\nXiaochuan in 2009. His proposals include establishing a settlement system\nbetween SDR and other currencies, and promoting the use of SDR\nin global trade, financial transactions, commodities pricing and\nbookkeeping. SDRs are backed by a basket of major currencies and commonly\nused as the unit of denomination for financial arrangements\nbetween the IMF and its members, which include development\nfinancing and emergency loans to countries with liquidity\nproblems. Yao says the SDR basket should also include currencies of\nall major economies, whose GDPs should be taken into account in\nsetting the currencies\' weightings. The opinion column comes as China looks set to win approval\nfor the yuan to be included in the SDR currency\nbasket after years of lobbying, seen as a major diplomatic\nvictory for Beijing as it tries to increase its global clout. However, Yao\'s comments highlight a potential source of\ntension; while many IMF officials see SDR inclusion as driving\nreforms in China, Beijing sees inclusion as a step toward\nreforming the IMF, which some see as held hostage to the\ninterests of developed economies. "China needs to study more closely profound issues in global\neconomic and financial fluctuations, and be more forward-looking\nin terms of technological trends so as to have first-mover\nadvantage, and to some degree, become more proactive in setting\nthe rules of the global game." Yao said that the current system did not reflect the rise of\nemerging markets, and that the supply of an international\nreserve currency should be detached from the economic policies\nof any particular country. "We think the issuance of, and continuous improvement in\neSDR can help establish a new cross-border payment and\nsettlement system using a super-sovereign currency, thus easing\nflaws in the traditional monetary system," Yao said. The article\nwas co-written with Yang Tao, a researcher at the Chinese\nAcademy of Social Sciences. Technologies such as blockchain - a decentralised public\nledger of electronic transactions that underpins digital payment\nmethods such as bitcoin - could be adapted to develop the eSDR.\nThe authors said that issuing eSDR could help ease a liquidity\ngap that could open in 2017 when central banks in Japan and\nEurope are expected to end quantitative easing. The growing global use of bitcoin has stoked interest in the\ndevelopment of digital currencies, even among banks and\ngovernments.\n\n (Additional reporting by Kevin Yao; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\nand Sam Holmes)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Samuel Shen'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N13C14720151117', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 17, 1, 48), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"IMF's Special Drawing Rights should go digital - China c.bank researcher"}, {'articleText': u' By Sarah Hurst and Dominic Elliott The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own. Banks that have been pooling resources on blockchain technology should apply their camaraderie in a different field: cyber security. The hacking of an unnamed commercial lender, revealed by financial messaging system SWIFT on May 12, followed an $81 million cyber heist from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in February. An industry utility \u2013 or at least better coordinated defences \u2013 is needed. Increased regulatory requirements and rock bottom interest rates, both a legacy of last decade\u2019s financial crisis, have made it hard for banks to make an economic return. Distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin may help cut sector costs. That\u2019s why over 40 banks have joined blockchain development group R3. Cyber security should be next on the list. It\u2019s likely to be banks\u2019 biggest cost in terms of financial crime prevention this year and next, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions. Weak cyber defences might prompt a credit rating downgrade, says Standard & Poor\u2019s. Lenders may feel worried about sharing sensitive data with rivals. But the aviation industry, long teetering on the edge of profitability, improved efficiency by sharing accident information via black box technology. And greater teamwork would help keep tabs on would-be criminals. Companies\u2019 own employees represent a huge threat: business investigations firm Kroll said in its latest annual global fraud report that insiders accounted for 81 percent of perpetrators. A shared database of suspects might be a safeguard. Regulators and governments could play a bigger role, too. The European Central Bank\u2019s plan for a database of serious incidents, as reported by the Financial Times on May 12, looks no more than a first step. The U.S. Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center has had limited success \u2013 only 5 percent of the cyber threats American Express finds are the subject of warnings from other institutions, the company\u2019s Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said last year. But lenders right now seem to be doing too little. Europe\u2019s private sector-led Cyber Defence Alliance consists of just four banks. Financial institutions have demonstrated an unusual level of esprit de corps when it comes to new technology.

Kats, who has been in custody since his arrest in May 2013, was also ordered to forfeit $6.5 million.

His lawyer, Christopher Flood, asked for a sentence of time served. Cote, however, said Kats\' "enormous criminal activity" called for a longer sentence. Liberty Reserve operated a widely used digital currency, processing more than $8 billion in transactions while helping launder proceeds from Ponzi schemes, credit card trafficking, identity thefts and computer hacking, prosecutors said. The company was shuttered in May 2013 as Kats and Budovsky were arrested amid U.S. efforts to crack down on the use of digital currencies including bitcoin to evade law enforcement.

In 2005, they launched Liberty Reserve, which later relocated to Costa Rica. In 2008, Budovsky pushed Kats out of Liberty Reserve, complaining he had not done enough, prosecutors said.

Coinsilium\'s Executive Chairman Cameron Parry told Reuters that the decision to pursue an IPO on ISDX was linked to listing requirements he said were more favorable with the ICAP bourse. "The ISDX is the best fit for Coinsilium," he said, without giving specific details. John Holland, senior partner at consultancy Holland Bendelow, said that ISDX is still in its infancy and has yet to capture a large institutional investor following, though the costs of joining are lower than for AIM. Coinsilium\'s indicative time-frame for the ISDX listing suggests it will begin trading on the exchange the week commencing Nov. 23. Blockchain, which Coinsilium is promoting as its investment specialty, is essentially a massive ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made, verified and shared by a global network of computers. Big names from IBM (IBM.N) to NASDAQ (NDAQ.O) are among those exploring how blockchain could be applied to financial markets. Coinsilium CEO Eddy Travia had told news outlets in July that the company\'s IPO was planned for August and would raise about 3 million pounds ($4.6 million) to expand investments. The company\'s portfolio includes stakes in nine businesses. Its biggest holding is in The Real Asset Co, a precious-metals trading platform, according to its marketing documents.

Arthur Budovsky, 42, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan, who said a substantial punishment was warranted for his role in running a money laundering operation that prosecutors said was of unprecedented scope. "Sad to say, Mr. Budovsky used his enormous talents here in a way that led to widespread harm," she said. Budovsky, who pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy to commit money laundering, was also ordered to forfeit $122 million and fined $500,000. He said nothing in court as his lawyer, John Kaley, argued for less than 15 years in prison. "Remorse has been exhibited here," he said. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Christian Everdell sought the maximum 20-year sentence given Budovsky\'s role "at the helm of this sweeping enterprise." Liberty Reserve operated a widely used digital currency, processing more than $8 billion in financial transactions and earning Budovsky over $25 million, prosecutors said. Much of its business came from criminals seeking to launder proceeds from Ponzi schemes, credit card trafficking, identity thefts and computer hacking, prosecutors said. The company was shuttered in May 2013 as Budovsky was arrested amid U.S. efforts to crack down on the use of digital currencies including bitcoin to evade law enforcement and launder money. Four other people pleaded guilty, including Liberty Reserve co-founder Vladimir Kats, who is set to be sentenced next week. Budovsky and Kats, who met as teenagers working as camp counselors in Brooklyn, previously were convicted in 2006 on New York state charges for operating an earlier digital currency exchange as an unlicensed money transmitting business. They launched Liberty Reserve in 2005, and after their arrests, moved it to Costa Rica, where Budovsky became a citizen. Liberty Reserve users would buy and redeem its digital currency, LR, through third-party exchangers who in turn bought and sold LR in bulk from Liberty Reserve, authorities said. Users did not have to validate their identities, prosecutors said, allowing an undercover Secret Service agent to establish an account for a "Joe Bogus" from "Completely Made Up City, New York, United States." Of $7.26 billion in transactions by Liberty Reserve\'s top 500 accounts, $2.6 billion were for investment opportunities, mostly Ponzi schemes, prosecutors said. The case is U.S. v.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who made his fortune as a former online entrepreneur, is trying to position himself as a leader who can transform Australia into a tech-savvy business hub as its economy deals with a commodities downturn. Tech measures in the 2016/17 spending plan include the appointment of a Cyber Ambassador, the creation of a cyber cooperation program in the Indo-Pacific region, co-investment in startups created by the country\'s scientific agency and consultation on a "regulatory sandbox" for FinTech businesses who want to test their early stage ideas with clients. "A strong and vibrant FinTech industry will play an important role in the transition underway in Australia\'s economy," Treasurer Scott Morrison said. The budget allocates some A$195 million over four years in Australia\'s cyber security capability, including the creation of the Cyber Ambassador role and fresh funds for Australian Federal Police. Turnbull said last month that hacking attacks cost the country A$1 billion a year. The Bureau of Meteorology and department store chain Kmart Australia Ltd, owned by Wesfarmers Ltd (WES.AX), both suffered online attacks last year. The budget includes support for private-public partnerships for Australian businesses to develop and promote their cyber security capabilities globally. "So often, successful technology ventures have started by solving a complex problem for governments," Morrison said.  The government also released a discussion paper seeking public submissions on options to address the "double taxation" of consumers who use digital currencies such as BitCoin to buy goods and services already subject to sales tax.  The paper comes just a day after an Australian, Craig Wright, claimed he was the founder of the crypto-currency known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Australia\'s new innovation strategy doesn\'t entirely abandon the resources sector, which represents around 10 percent of Australia\'s gross domestic product (GDP) and more than 50 percent of its exports. The budget provides A$100 million to Geoscience Australia for mapping mineral, petroleum and groundwater potential in targeted areas across northern Australia and South Australia with the aim of identifying new greenfield sites for future development. Geoscience says some 80 percent of Australia remains underexplored. "This will improve Australia\'s long term exploration prospects and help address declining new onshore exploration," Resources and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said.

The technology, which will be rolled out on NPM later this\nyear, is the same type that underpins the digital currency\nbitcoin. Nasdaq and Chain said it will make it easier for\nprivate companies to keep track of the shares they issue and to\nsettle transactions. "Having an immutable record from the inception of a company\nthrough the various financings and exits, that is indisputable,\nthat is shared and open, is going to create a better corporate\ngovernance model," Chain Chief Executive Officer Adam Ludwin \nsaid in an interview. Nasdaq launched its market for private companies in 2014\nfollowing the passing of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act\n(JOBS) in 2012, which increased the amount of shareholders an\nunlisted company can have to 2,000 from 500. The market was\ndesigned to make it easier for investors of private companies to\nexit, including helping employees with a large portion of their\ncompensation tied to shares to sell them when needed. Chain is one of the companies that has signed onto NPM, and\nit will be the first to utilize the blockchain technology to\nmanage its shares when Nasdaq makes the service available later\nthis year.

"We would rather have the blockchain manage our shares than\nour lawyers - and God bless them, we love them, but they\'re\nexpensive - and I am sick of poking around Excel trying to\nfigure out who owns what," said Ludwin.

The technology, according to its many supporters, would make it easier to create cost-efficient business networks without requiring central control. The interest in the blockchain surged last year when Wall Street\'s major players such as Goldman Sachs delved into the technology and saw it as a way to solve inefficiencies in financial markets. "Clients tell us that one of the inhibitors of the adoption of blockchain is concerns about security," said Jerry Cuomo, vice president, Blockchain at IBM in a statement.  "While there is a sense of urgency to pioneer blockchain for business, most organizations need help to define the ideal cloud environment that enables blockchain networks to run securely in the cloud." IBM said it is addressing security issues in several ways, including cloud services with the highest Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 140-2) and Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL) in the industry to support the use of blockchain in government, financial services and healthcare.  The technology company also announced the opening of an IBM Garage in New York and London. These garages are similar to research labs on the blockchain created by several major financial institutions over the past year. IBM\'s garages are dedicated to helping clients design and develop their blockchain networks, said Cuomo. Garages in Tokyo, London and Singapore will also open in the coming weeks to enable clients to collaborate with IBM experts on the design and implementation of blockchain for business.

Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, keeps track of and authenticates a continuously growing list of transaction  data which is secured by a global network of computers and cannot be tampered with or revised. Though still in its infancy, having first been used to underpin the web-based currency bitcoin that started seven years ago, the technology has attracted increasing interest from  banks and other financial institutions, who reckon it could cut their transactional costs, speeding up clearing and settlement processes, and increase market transparency.  The new project will initially focus on the Australian market, using SETL\'s blockchain to record asset ownership and to automate the transfer of title from one owner to another.  "It\'s going to make (Computershare\'s) life easier, it\'s going to make their clients\' lives easier, and it\'s potentially going to reduce the cost of the whole administration of securities ownership registers," said Anthony Culligan, SETL\'s founder and chief executive. Culligan said the new technology would make central securities depositories (CSDs), often run using old computer systems, more lightweight and efficient. But though they might in the future be smaller, he said CSDs would still need to exist for regulatory reasons.    The project must still get regulatory approval, and Culligan estimates it will take 12 to 18 months for it to be operational.  Computershare, one of the world\'s biggest securities registrars whose clients include the UK Debt Management Office,  said it had chosen to work with SETL because "they have demonstrable working technology, coupled with a deep bench of financial services expertise and experience". Culligan was previously a hedge fund investor and JP Morgan director, while SETL\'s chairman is former Barclays chairman Sir David Walker and its joint chief executive officer is Peter Randall, the former head of electronic stock exchange Chi-X Europe.   Australia is emerging as a leader in blockchain investment. This year the Australian Securities Exchange bought a $10 million stake in Digital Asset Holdings, a start-up headed by former JP Morgan luminary Blythe Masters, who has been leading the charge into blockchain technology for financiers. Masters said last month that that Australian markets\' lack of fragmentation made the country an ideal location to test the nascent technology.

"We don\'t want pre-emptive regulation, but we do want\nprecautionary monitoring," Jakob von Weizsaecker, a German\ncentre-left member of the European Parliament, told Reuters. He was speaking ahead of a vote on Tuesday in the\nparliament\'s economic affairs committee on his report on virtual\ncurrencies and blockchain, also known as distributed ledger\ntechnology. It is the latest sign of caution among regulators and\nlawmakers keen not to stifle innovation and risk losing out in a\nglobal race to exploit such financial technology, or fintech. Blockchain\'s proponents say it will "disrupt" finance by\nslashing the cost of payment transactions and settling stock\ntrades. "One reason why regulating now in detail would be difficult\nis that we don\'t know yet what the most important use of\nblockchain might be," von Weizsaecker said. His report is non-binding but it will help shape likely\ndraft EU legislation later on. It asks the European Commission\nto set up a task force to monitor blockchain. Christopher Giancarlo, a member of the U.S. Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission, said last month that regulators\nshould "do no harm" and allow blockchain to flourish. Britain\'s Financial Conduct Authority will allow testing of\nfintech innovations on consumers from May in a controlled\nenvironment, or "sandbox", before considering new rules. But SWIFT, the global electronic messaging system used by\n11,000 banks, said this month that blockchain was not mature\nenough to fulfil the requirements of the financial community,\nthough others see it as only a matter of time. "Some of the technology considered new-fangled, untested or\nunproven today, including distributed ledger technology, will\nbecome mainstream within the next ten years," Wall Street\nveteran and head of a blockchain start-up, Blythe Masters, said\nlast week in London. Uncertainty over regulation was hindering the development of\nblockchain, Masters added. Vincent Mercer, a consultant at Charles Russell Speechlys,\nsaid there was a significant risk that regulators will upset\nblockchain\'s potential by regulating too fast and without\ncoordination. The European Central Bank said on Monday it was\nexperimenting with blockchain, and the Bank of England is also\nlooking at what it means for updating its own payments system. Andrew Hauser, BoE executive director for payments, said\nlast week the authorities had to keep abreast of blockchain. "Central banks can\'t afford to be Ubered," Hauser joked,\nreferring to the ride-hailing app shaking up the taxi sector.

"According to Ulbricht, the government\'s gamesmanship in this regard led to inadequate trial preparation, an inability to investigate whether certain evidence might be exculpatory, and, ultimately, an unfair trial," Forrest wrote in a 25-page decision. "These arguments are without merit." Ulbricht is appealing his conviction. In an email on Tuesday, his lawyer, Joshua Dratel, said the legal issues reviewed in Forrest\'s decision will be addressed in the appeal. A federal jury on Feb. 4 found Ulbricht, 31, guilty of narcotics and other charges for helping to enable about $200 million of anonymous online drug sales using the virtual currency bitcoin. Prosecutors said Ulbricht ran Silk Road under the pseudonym "Dread Pirate Roberts" before the website was shut down in October 2013. Ulbricht conceded that he created Silk Road, but said he was not responsible for illegal activity there. On March 30, the U.S. Department of Justice announced criminal charges, accusing former federal agents Carl Force and Shaun Bridges of wire fraud and money laundering tied to their alleged theft of bitcoin during the Silk Road probe. Forrest said she found no basis to believe any undisclosed material related to the agents would have been "remotely useful" to Ulbricht\'s defense. "There is no reasonable probability of a different outcome here," she wrote. Ulbricht faces up to life in prison. Dratel has asked that the May 15 sentencing be delayed, saying in part he needs to review new information from prosecutors on six alleged overdose deaths attributed to drugs bought from vendors on Silk Road. The case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No, 14-cr-00068.

The auction being conducted by the U.S. Marshals Service is\nthe third for bitcoins seized in connection with Silk Road,\nwhich prosecutors said let customers buy and sell drugs and\nother illegal goods beneath the radar of law enforcement. A federal jury in Manhattan on Feb. 4 found Ulbricht guilty\nof narcotics and other charges for helping to enable about $200\nmillion of anonymous online drug sales using bitcoins. Prosecutors said Ulbricht, 30, had run Silk Road under the\npseudonym "Dread Pirate Roberts" before the website was shut\ndown in October 2013. Ulbricht conceded that he created Silk Road, but was not\nresponsible for illegal activity conducted there.

Ross Ulbricht, 30, was found guilty by a Manhattan federal jury on all seven counts he faced after a closely watched four-week trial spilling out of U.S. investigations of the use of the bitcoin digital currency for drug trafficking and other crimes. The jury of six men and six women needed a little over three hours to deliberate before finding Ulbricht guilty of charges that included conspiracies to commit money laundering, computer hacking and drug trafficking. Ulbricht, who prosecutors say went by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts in a reference to the 1987 movie "The Princess Bride," faces up to life in prison and a mandatory minimum term of 20 years. His sentencing was scheduled for May 15. Ulbricht has attracted many supporters to his cause, including some who say the government\'s case is an attack on Internet freedom. After the verdict was read, Ulbricht turned toward his supporters and raised his hand as he was led from the court. "Ross is a hero," shouted one supporter wearing dreadlocks. Joshua Dratel, Ulbricht\'s lawyer, said he would appeal. He said he was too limited in presenting evidence and that Ulbricht had been convicted based on statements not attributed by name to his client. "It\'s very disappointing," he said.  DARK WEB Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Ulbricht\'s conviction should send a message to anyone attempting to operate an online criminal enterprise. "The supposed anonymity of the dark web is not a protective shield from arrest and prosecution," he said. Silk Road operated from at least January 2011 until October 2013, when authorities seized the website and arrested Ulbricht at a public library in San Francisco. The website relied on the so-called Tor network, which lets users communicate anonymously, and accepted payment through bitcoins, which according to prosecutors allowed users to conceal their identities and locations. By the time it was shut down, Silk Road had generated nearly $213.9 million in sales and $13.2 million in commissions, prosecutors said. They said Ulbricht took extreme steps to protect Silk Road, soliciting the murders of several people who posed a threat. No evidence exists that the murders were carried out.  \'FALL GUY\' Ulbricht conceded that he created Silk Road, and his lawyer Dratel said it was intended as a "freewheeling, free market site" where all but a few harmful items could be sold. But Dratel said Ulbricht\'s "economic experiment" eventually became too stressful for him, so he handed it off to others. He was lured back toward its end, he said, becoming the "fall guy" for its true operators. At trial, Dratel sought to raise questions in jurors\' minds about whether someone else, such as Mark Karpeles, the former chief of the failed Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, was operating Silk Road for much of its existence. Karpeles was never charged and has denied involvement with Silk Road. Although a federal agent told jurors he had been investigating Karpeles, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest later struck much of that testimony as improper. Prosecutors said the Dread Pirate Roberts alias itself was a cover story intended to suggest the name could be passed to others, as happened in "The Princess Bride." They also said Ulbricht was arrested in October 2013 while logged into Silk Road on his laptop as Dread Pirate Roberts, chatting with an undercover federal investigator posing as a member of the website\'s staff.

Prosecutors showed jurors in Manhattan federal court journal entry excerpts dated in 2010 and 2011 found on a laptop seized when the FBI arrested Ross Ulbricht, who authorities say operated the website where drugs and other illicit goods could be bought with bitcoins. "Silk Road is going to become a phenomenon and at least one person will tell me about it, unknowing that I was its creator," a 2010 journal entry on Ulbricht\'s laptop said. The documents came on the fifth day of the high-profile trial to spill out of U.S. authorities\' efforts to crack down on the use of the digital currency bitcoin for drug trafficking and other crimes. Prosecutors say Ulbricht operated Silk Road under the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts" in a scheme that generated $200 million in drug sales until authorities shut the website down. Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit narcotics trafficking. Joshua Dratel, his lawyer, has acknowledged Ulbricht created Silk Road but says his client became the "fall guy" for its true operators. Prosecutors introduced the journal entries as well as chatlogs found on the laptop in an effort to demonstrate Ulbricht was Silk Road\'s operator. A 2010 entry on Ulbricht\'s laptop said the website was originally going to be called "Underground Brokers." "The idea was to create a website where people could buy anything anonymously, with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them," the journal said. A 2011 journal entry detailed the launch of Silk Road, a "huge spike in signups" after getting press attention and calls by two U.S. senators for Silk Road\'s shutdown. "I was mentally taxed, and now I felt extremely vulnerable and scared," the journal said. "The US govt, my main enemy was aware of me and some of it\'s members were calling for my destruction." A Dec. 29, 2011, journal entry detailed going out that day  with a woman who knew "I work with bitcoin" and telling her about having "secrets." "It felt wrong to lie completely so I tried to tell the truth without revealing the bad part, but now I am in a jam," the entry wrote. "Everyone knows too much. Dammit." The case is U.S. v.

The legislation, which would call for hackers using ransomware to be prosecuted under a statute similar to extortion but geared specifically to cyber crime, easily cleared the state senate\'s public safety committee. Senate Bill 1137 moves next to that body\'s appropriations committee. It must be approved by both houses of the California legislature and be signed by Governor Jerry Brown to become law.     A spokesman for the measure\'s author, state Senator Bob Hertzberg, said the measure, which was co-sponsored by the Los Angeles County District Attorney\'s Office, had been met with little opposition so far. "We don\'t anticipate any problems with the bill, it seems to be getting very strong support," said Andrew LaMar, communications director for Hertzberg, a Democrat. Authorities say ransomware attacks, in which hackers use malicious software to lock up data in computers and leave messages demanding payment have surged this year. More than $209 million in ransomware payments were made in the United States alone during the first three months of 2016,  according to FBI statistics cited by Hertzberg\'s office. In March, Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles paid a ransom of $17,000 to regain access to its systems. Los Angeles prosecutors, in a letter to the state senate\'s public safety committee, said that the bill was needed because current extortion laws are not well tailored toward prosecuting ransomware attacks. While such attacks have been around longer than a decade, security experts say they have become far more threatening and prevalent in recent years because of state-of-the-art encryption, modules that infect backup systems, and the ability to infect large numbers of computers over a single network. Run-of-the-mill ransomware attacks typically seek 1 bitcoin, now worth about $420, which is about the same as the hourly rate that some security consultants charge to respond to such incidents, according to security firms who investigate ransomware cases.

Lynzey Donahue, a Marshals Service spokeswoman, said the government had 11 registered bidders and 27 resulting bids. Winning bidders for the bitcoins, valued at $18.6 million, will be notified on Friday. It was the Marshals Service\'s second such auction following  one in June for almost 30,000 bitcoins seized during a raid on  Silk Road in 2013. To date, the government has recovered 173,991 bitcoins while pursuing the case, including 144,336 from computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, the alleged creator of the underground website. As part of a civil forfeiture proceeding, Ulbricht and the government reached a deal in January under which the bitcoins on his hardware would be sold and the proceeds held, pending the outcome of his case. The remaining bitcoins from Ulbricht\'s hardware will be auctioned in the coming months.  Donahue said authorities "didn\'t want to flood the market" with too many bitcoins at once. The previous auction of 29,655 bitcoins, which were recovered from Silk Road\'s servers, was won by a single bidder, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper. Terms were not disclosed. Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX, wrote in a note ahead of the auction that bidders this time "will likely lowball their bids relative to the current market price." "My expectation is that most bids will be aggressively to the downside in the hope of getting a post-Black Friday bargain," he wrote. Draper said Wednesday he would be among the bidders participating in the auction. Others who have said they will bid in the auction include the Bitcoin Investment Trust and Pantera Capital. Ulbricht, known online as "Dread Pirate Roberts," according to prosecutors, faces trial Jan. 5 on charges including conspiracy, money laundering and narcotics trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty. Bitcoin prices were down 0.7 percent late Thursday at $372.81. The digital currency has lost roughly half its value so far this year.

The announcement came in a package of measures unveiled by\nfinance minister George Osborne aimed at boosting financial\ninnovation in London to help fend off challengers to the city\'s\nstatus as the world\'s leading financial centre. Unlike conventional money, virtual currencies are not backed\nby a central bank or government, but have become increasingly\nused as a means of online exchange with some bricks-and-mortar\nvendors also accepting them as payment for goods and services. "The government will look at the potential virtual and\ndigital currencies have for achieving positive change and for\nencouraging innovation in our world leading financial sector, as\nwell as the potential risks," said a finance ministry statement. The government said it would begin researching how such\ncurrencies could, or should, be regulated in Britain. So far\nthere has been no co-ordinated global approach to regulating\nvirtual currencies and no country has given them legal status. Bitcoin, the best known of the 200 or so computer-generated\ncurrencies, has come under particular scrutiny since Tokyo-based\nexchange Mt. Gox went bankrupt in February after losing an\nestimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins. Last month the European Banking Authority published a study\nadvising banks to steer clear of virtual currencies until rules\nare in place. The European Commission said it was imperative to\nlook at regulating the sector to address the potential for\n"money laundering and terrorist financing."  ALTERNATIVE FINANCE Osborne also said the government was enlisting the help of\nindustry and academic experts to look at the increasingly key\nrole of technology in finance and its likely policy implications\nover the next decade. Financial services makes up around 8 percent of the British\neconomy, and Osborne said it was vital to harness new technology\nto ensure Britain remained a global leader and to sustain its\neconomic recovery. He confirmed plans to improve the growth generated by small\nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by encouraging them to tap\nthe burgeoning alternative finance sector. The finance ministry said that banks that reject SMEs for\nfinance will be required to ask firms whether they want to be\nreferred to third parties who would then try to match them up\nwith challenger banks and alternative lenders. This would funnel demand for cash toward new sources of\nfunding like peer-to-peer lenders, which allow individuals to\nlend money directly to small companies or other individuals,\ncutting out the banks and lowering the cost for businesses. "It\'s good that more SMEs are making use of alternative\nfinance but the big banks still dominate and small businesses\noften give up if they\'re turned down for finance by their bank,"\nsaid Business Secretary Vince Cable. Britain\'s fledgling alternative funding market almost\ndoubled in size in 2013, rising to around 1 billion pounds\n($1.69 billion).

Chris DeMuth, a partner at Rangeley Capital who had been considering bidding, said last week the chance the Marshals Service gets the market price for the bitcoins is low.

Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, creates a shared database in which participants can trace every transaction ever conducted. Its proponents say it has the potential to shake up how financial markets operate. It is part of the "fintech" sector that is beginning to catch the eye of regulators as big banks invest in uses of blockchain for critical market infrastructure such as settlement of securities transactions, bond trading and cross-border payments. ICAP said it has used blockchain to feed customers "golden source" data needed for reporting trades to regulators or  covering risks from trades, such as by posting the right amount of collateral or cash at clearing houses. During a "proof of technology" run last month, data on forex trades was distributed over blockchain to nine participants, ICAP said. Banks could save money in middle- and back-office functions by relying on the golden source data to meet different requirements, rather than having to repeatedly "re-validate" the trades in their own systems for each application, ICAP said. "We believe we are the first to do this using distributed ledger and blockchain technology," said Jenny Knott, chief executive of ICAP\'s Post Trade Risk and Information unit. "What\'s really transformational is that the banks no longer have to do so much themselves." A bank is only allowed to access its own trades in the ledger. ICAP said its distributed ledger system would be scaled to cover all, and not just new, trades to show that the data is reliable and give banks the confidence to turn off their in-house technology. "What we are going to do now is work with our partner banks to develop parallel technology to add all asset classes and all trades," Knott said. Last month the global Financial Stability Board, a group of regulators chaired by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, said it would start looking at how fintech innovations like blockchain are being used in financial markets. While its use now is tiny, policymakers want to be ready in case it involves much larger sums of money, thereby creating so-called systemic risks.

The company\'s initial public\noffering is expected to be priced at $19-$21 per share, valuing the marketing software provider\nat $637 million at the top end of the range. HubSpot\'s offering of 5 million shares is expected\nto raise up to $105 million. Sequoia Capital, Charles River Ventures and General Catalyst\nPartners are among HubSpot\'s stockholders. HubSpot helps businesses personalize interactions\nwith customers, who are increasingly averse to traditional marketing tactics such as cold calls,\nunsolicited emails and disruptive advertisements. The company\'s shares will trade under the\nsymbol "HUBS". MOL Global Inc\'s initial public offering is expected to be priced at $12.50-$14.50 per share on\nThursday, valuing the Malaysian online payment company at $978.8 million at the top end of the\nrange. The IPO of 19.5 million American Depository Shares is expected to raise up to $282.2\nmillion. The company, majority-owned by Malaysian billionaire Vincent Tan, is expanding in\nSoutheast Asia and plans to tap the Malaysian government\'s push to drive e-payments in\npreparation for a new consumption tax that kicks in next year. Dave & Buster\'s Entertainment Inc\'s initial public offering is expected to be priced at $16-$18\nper share on Friday, valuing the restaurant and arcade chain at $703.6 million at the top end of\nthe range. Dave & Buster\'s is expected to raise $105.9 million from the offering of 5.9 million\nshares. The company offers sports-oriented entertainment as well as video and simulation games\nalong with food and beverages at 69 venues it owns and operates. Poor market conditions led Dave\n& Buster\'s to abort plans to go public in 2012. An industry advisory committee chaired by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will talk on\nThursday about the agency\'s jurisdiction in derivative contracts referencing bitcoin. Recently,\nthe agency approved its first bitcoin swap for the Tera Exchange trading platform. The second\nissue on the agenda is non-deliverable forwards. This is the next type of swap that the CFTC is\nlooking to designate for clearing, which would subject the market to much tighter rule. The\nmeeting will be chaired by Mark Wetjen, the CFTC Commissioner who heads the Global Markets\nAdvisory Committee. Canada will get its employment report for September next Friday, a week after the U.S. one is\nreleased. Hiring is expected to pick up by 20,000 jobs, more than recovering from the previous\nmonth\'s loss of 11,000 positions, but the report has come under scrutiny of late for its swings\nin both directions. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 7 percent. Investors\nwill also take in a handful of reports on the housing sector next week, with building permits\nexpected to drop in August after hitting a record high the month before, while housing starts\nand the new home price index are both seen edging up. Brazilians go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president in a race closely watched by\ninvestors wary of slow growth and state interference in Latin America\'s largest economy under\nleftist President Dilma Rousseff. Polls suggest the election is likely to go to a second-round\nrunoff on Oct. 26 between frontrunner Rousseff and environmentalist Marina Silva, who was thrust\ninto the race in mid-August after her party\'s original candidate, Eduardo Campos, was killed in\na plane crash. An opposition victory would put an end to 12 years of Workers\' Party rule.\n\nBrazil\'s September inflation rate will be released on Wednesday by statistics agency IBGE. The\nannual inflation rate probably drifted away from the government\'s target ceiling in September,\nleaving little room for any government measures to pull the economy out of a recession.\nStubbornly high inflation is one of Brazil\'s biggest economic problems. It has eroded business\nand consumer confidence, held back investments and prompted the central bank to lift interest\nrates earlier this year to 11 percent, a more than two-year high. On the same day, Chile is\nscheduled to report September inflation data. Readings in recent months have been consistently\nhigher than forecast and above the central bank target range. Brazil will host its Economic Conference on Friday. Sandwiched between the first and second\nround of the country\'s presidential elections, the conference will discuss Brazil as a market\nfor foreign investment. The country has suffered from mounting inflation and a weakened currency\nin recent months. Many traders see Brazil\'s risk premium declining under a different\nadministration, which would help attract foreign investment and support the real. The meeting\nwill include speeches by Brazil\'s foreign minister, the ambassador of Brazil to the United\nStates and the president of the Brazilian Development Bank. Mexican consumer price data for September on Thursday will show if inflation is continuing to\nrise above the central bank\'s 4 percent limit or if it has begun to cool after a recent spike in\nfresh food prices. Industrial output data for August on Friday will show if factory and\nconstruction sectors are picking up after a sluggish start to the year. Peru\'s central bank decides on Friday whether to hold the interest rate at 3.5 percent amid weak\ngrowth and tame inflation. The central bank lowered the key rate in September, its third cut\nover the past year as the economy has slowed to its slowest pace since 2009. The monetary\nauthority then revised down its 2014 growth outlook to 3.5 percent and loosened reserve rules on\ndeposits in the local sol currency - a policy it has used to help stimulate growth. MONDAY, OCTOBER 6\nThe Federal Reserve will begin publishing a new monthly index of U.S. labor market conditions\nthat draws on a range of data to give a better sense of the economy\'s health. The Labor Market\nConditions Index, or LCMI, is the second new labor market indicator to be generated by the\ncentral bank as it tries to develop a better understanding of wage, job and related dynamics in\nthe current economy. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George speaks on the U.S. economy before an\neconomic forum hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (2030/0030).

The froth can be seen in everything from Pakistan\'s stock market to thoroughbred racehorses, rare paintings and gemstones, taxi licenses and the digital currency Bitcoin. "When it gets like this, just pick your asset - a painting, a bottle of wine, whatever. It\'s almost always a sign that there\'s too much money floating around," said Howard Simons, a strategist at Bianco Research in Chicago. Certainly, the risks don\'t look as great as they did in 2005-2007, when real estate prices in the U.S. and other countries skyrocketed, then collapsed, triggering the financial crisis. The most inflated prices are in smaller pockets of the markets than they were back then, so there is less systemic risk. But if a series of smaller financial market bubbles deflate or even burst there will still be a lot of agony, investment strategists warn. When the Fed does pull back from stimulating the economy by cutting back its quantitative easing program of bond buying - which is expected in the first half of 2014 - there could be some shocks for markets to withstand, said Win Thin, an emerging market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "That could lead to some painful adjustments." One toxic corner of the markets can infect stronger assets as investors seek to raise cash to cope with a plunge. "What I learned in the last two bear markets is that it doesn\'t matter if you own the crappy asset," said Simons. "If someone else does and starts panic selling, it takes your good stuff down too." And a further bond market selloff, following the reversal this summer, could not only hurt investors but threaten a downturn - as mortgage rates and other borrowing costs climb. ETERNAL BULLS There is evidence of possible excess in many areas. Getting into a taxi cab these days may no longer come with a menu of can\'t-miss stock tips from the driver but the cab\'s owner probably paid a steep price for the right to the license. At a New York auction last week, taxi medallions sold for more than $1 million, about double the prices paid five years ago. As for U.S. stocks, it\'s hard to find many bearish investors despite - or because of - the 26 percent gain in the S&P 500 index this year and the 166 percent rise since 2009. In Europe, it often feels as if the continent-wide debt crisis that threatened the euro never happened. Price-to-earnings ratios have soared to 2007 levels even as earnings momentum has sputtered. Over the last month, short-selling has dropped to a seven-year low and top performers in the STOXX Europe 600 index are shares that were once heavily shorted. As hedge fund manager David Einhorn put it in a letter to investors in October: "When \'high short interest\' becomes a viable stock-picking strategy and conventional valuation methods no longer apply for many stocks, we can\'t help but feel a sense of d\xe9j\xe0 vu," he said in reference to the dotcom stocks bubble and bust in 1998-2001. IPO FEVER AT COMPANIES That particular bubble turned investors, especially retail investors, into addicts for the latest stock offerings. And things are looking a bit frothy again. So far, 199 U.S. companies have gone public this year, the highest number since 2007, and some of the first-day gains have been huge. Such a race to list is a sign that things are nearing a top, says Peter Atwater, president of Financial Insyghts, an investment advisory firm in Mendenhall, Pennsylvania. While the broader U.S. market does not look particularly pricey - the S&P\'s forward P/E ratio of 15 is about bang in line with the long-run average - individual stocks certainly do. Look no further than some of the biggest names coming to market in recent years, such as the social media star Twitter or electric car maker Tesla Motors. At current market prices, after almost doubling on its first day of trading, the micro-blogging site is valued at almost $24 billion despite being unprofitable. Tesla is trading at a P/E ratio of around 80 based on expected 2014 earnings. Even the retailer Container Store Group Inc, which sells things to put things in, saw its shares double on its stock market debut on November 1. Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management, said, "nobody in their right mind would make an all cash offer at current levels for a lot of these companies." AND ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD Even professional athletes are getting in on the action. Arian Foster, a National Football League player with the Houston Texans, was the asset for a planned IPO based on 20 percent of his future earnings, which he had sold to San Francisco-based Fantex. The firm would then sell stocks based on Foster\'s economic performance. "I thought it was a joke," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co. "They\'re not robots, they wear down. What\'s the life of an average guy in the NFL, four years?" Fantex, though, had to postpone the Foster IPO after the running back suffered a season-ending injury, underlining just how risky an investment it would have been. IT\'S THE BOND MARKET, STUPID By suppressing interest rates, central banks have yield-starved investors falling over themselves to lend money to companies with less-than-stellar credit records, as well as looking for some of those exotic investments. Quite a few investors, frightened that super-low interest rates will start rising next year, have bought up floating-rate loans. The only problem: many have no covenants, which usually limit the amount of debt a borrower can take on and let lenders have a say in the business if things start to go sour. "People don\'t realize they\'re taking a lot of credit risk," said AllianceBernstein portfolio manager Gershon Distenfeld. Meanwhile, high-yield bond issuers - companies with weak balance sheets and sub-investment grade ratings - are paying on average 5.8 percent to borrow, near record lows. Default rates at around 2.5 percent are well below historical averages but Martin Fridson, head of FridsonVision, said recently he expects those default rates to spike to 8.4 percent between 2016-2020, which could cause a lot of forced selling. POCKET MONEY Perhaps one of the best ways to measure froth is to watch what the super-rich do with their pocket change. Lately, they seem to have developed an insatiable taste for fine art - a painting by Francis Bacon set a new high water mark when it fetched more than $142 million last week in New York. In Geneva, "Pink Star," a flawless pink diamond the size of a plum, sold for a cool $83 million, a record for a gemstone. Even the market for thoroughbred racehorses is roaring away. In Europe, a one-year-old horse that had never been raced sold this year for 5 million pounds ($8.1 million), a record price. "Most of the people involved in it are extremely rich, and lately they\'ve had the money to spend," said Alastair Donald, a horse-buying expert at UK racehorse agent SackvilleDonald. "There are ways of making money with racehorses, but mostly, it\'s a luxury, it\'s fun. It\'s about buying a dream." CURRENCY FOR CRIMINALS? Association with drugs, money laundering and other illegal activities has not tarnished the virtual shine of Bitcoin, the digital currency not backed by any government or central bank. The currency, whose supply has been carefully controlled, on Monday soared above $600 from below $80 in early July. Societe Generale strategist Sebastien Galy said Bitcoin is an example of "how far and aggressively greed can push a deeply inelastic market." And the casino approach isn\'t restricted to developed markets by any means. Pakistan is nobody\'s idea of a safe and predictable investment destination but one wouldn\'t know it from the nation\'s stock market. Pakistani stocks have nearly doubled since the start of 2012 and are well above their levels even before the financial crisis. It\'s another instance of the reach for yield driving political risk considerations out the window, says GFT Forex managing partner Boris Schlossberg. "The Fed\'s QE," he said, "is having a spillover effect all over the world." Consequences of the likely withdrawal of that support is the biggest issue for 2014. The risk is that even investors who have identified bubbles will wait too long to exit. (Reporting by Steven C.

Gox liquidation'}, {'articleText': u" TOKYO A group of investors have offered to take over the assets of Mt. Gox and revive the bankrupt bitcoin exchange with the help of experts including the investigative firm of a former FBI director, according to a court filing in Japan. The offer, filed with the Tokyo District Court last month, marks the first time that anyone has submitted a proposal to sponsor the rehabilitation of Mt. Gox since it sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on February 28. The group, which includes former child actor-turned entrepreneur Brock Pierce and venture capitalist William Quigley, made the offer through a special purpose company established in the Cyprus Republic, the court filing shows. None of the principals of the company, called Sunlot Holdings Ltd., could be reached for comment. Alpha Partners Law Offices, which is representing Sunlot in Tokyo, declined to comment. The proposal did not include an offer price, although the group said in the filing that it believed Mt. Gox's present enterprise value was zero. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the proposal, said the group was seeking to buy Mt. Gox for a token payment of one bitcoin, or about $400. Mt. Gox shut down its exchange and filed for bankruptcy in February. At the time it said hackers had stolen 750,000 bitcoins belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own bitcoins after exploiting a security flaw in its software. But then in March Mt. Gox announced that it had discovered 200,000 bitcoins in an old-format online wallet, which it had thought was empty, raising creditors' hopes of recovering some of their lost digital wealth. NEW MANAGEMENT, NEW SECURITY The investment group proposed a new management team headed by John Betts, who founded a data management firm and has held positions in electronic trading at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in the past, according to his LinkedIn page. The group said it would develop a new trading and security platform and review its relationship with banks as part of its effort to revive the exchange. It also proposed a forensic investigation. In the filing, the group listed Freeh Group International Solutions, a firm established by former FBI director Louis Freeh that has carried out a series of investigations into high-profile scandals, among a team of advisers it planned to tap for Mt. Gox. No one at the Freeh Group could immediately be reached for comment. Under the group's proposal, creditors would have the option of receiving payment from the 200,000 recovered bitcoins or receiving the equivalent amount in equity in the new exchange, according to the filing. The group said it would set aside 50 percent of its transaction fees to pay back burned customers and other creditors over time. The group did not disclose what amount, if any, it was willing to put towards the operations of the revived firm. It would need about $8 million for the first 18 weeks of its revival plan, which would come out of Mt. Gox's cash until the online exchange system is back up and running, the filing shows. The group will consider acquisitions and an initial public offering as part of a longer-term strategy for Mt. Gox, the filing said. It is not clear whether the court will give Mt. Gox a chance to revive with the help of a sponsor such as Sunlot Holdings. A court-appointed administrator has until May 9 to report on the results of an investigation into what led to Mt. Gox's collapse and whether it meets the criteria for rehabilitation under creditor protection or should be liquidated. In the filing, the investor group said it had been in talks with Mt. Gox about its operations since January 2013 and was in negotiations about a stock transaction when the company filed for bankruptcy protection this year.

The offer, filed with the Tokyo District Court last month,\nmarks the first time that anyone has submitted a proposal to\nsponsor the rehabilitation of Mt. Gox since it sought bankruptcy\nprotection from creditors on Feb. 28. The group, which includes former child actor-turned\nentrepreneur Brock Pierce and venture capitalist William\nQuigley, made the offer through a special purpose company\nestablished in the Cyprus Republic, the court filing shows. None of the principals of the company, called Sunlot\nHoldings Ltd., could be reached for comment. Alpha Partners Law\nOffices, which is representing Sunlot in Tokyo, declined to\ncomment. The proposal did not include an offer price, although the\ngroup said in the filing that it believed Mt. Gox's present\nenterprise value was zero. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the\nproposal, said the group was seeking to buy Mt. Gox for a token\npayment of one bitcoin, or about $400. Mt. Gox shut down its exchange and filed for bankruptcy in\nFebruary. At the time it said hackers had stolen 750,000\nbitcoins belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own\nbitcoins after exploiting a security flaw in its software.\n. But then in March Mt. Gox announced that it had discovered\n200,000 bitcoins in an old-format online wallet, which it had\nthought was empty, raising creditors' hopes of recovering some\nof their lost digital wealth.  NEW MANAGEMENT, NEW SECURITY The investment group proposed a new management team headed\nby John Betts, who founded a data management firm and has held\npositions in electronic trading at Morgan Stanley and Goldman\nSachs in the past, according to his LinkedIn page. The group said it would develop a new trading and security\nplatform and review its relationship with banks as part of its\neffort to revive the exchange. It also proposed a forensic\ninvestigation. In the filing, the group listed Freeh Group International\nSolutions, a firm established by former FBI director Louis Freeh\nthat has carried out a series of investigations into\nhigh-profile scandals, among a team of advisers it planned to\ntap for Mt. Gox. No one at the Freeh Group could immediately be reached for\ncomment. Under the group's proposal, creditors would have the option\nof receiving payment from the 200,000 recovered bitcoins or\nreceiving the equivalent amount in equity in the new exchange,\naccording to the filing. The group said it would set aside 50 percent of its\ntransaction fees to pay back burned customers and other\ncreditors over time. The group did not disclose what amount, if any, it was\nwilling to put towards the operations of the revived firm. It\nwould need about $8 million for the first 18 weeks of its\nrevival plan, which would come out of Mt. Gox's cash until the\nonline exchange system is back up and running, the filing shows. The group will consider acquisitions and an initial public\noffering as part of a longer-term strategy for Mt. Gox, the\nfiling said. It is not clear whether the court will give Mt. Gox a chance\nto revive with the help of a sponsor such as Sunlot Holdings. A court-appointed administrator has until May 9 to report on\nthe results of an investigation into what led to Mt. Gox's\ncollapse and whether it meets the criteria for rehabilitation\nunder creditor protection or should be liquidated. In the filing, the investor group said it had been in talks\nwith Mt. Gox about its operations since January 2013 and was in\nnegotiations about a stock transaction when the company filed\nfor bankruptcy protection this year.\n\n (With Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore; Editing by\nSriraj Kalluvila and Jane Baird)", 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0N24Z320140411', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 4, 11, 8, 28), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'UPDATE 2-Investor group offers to take over, revive Mt.

The opinions expressed are his own.\xa0 While America\u2019s financial technology industry has exploded in recent years, regulators have not kept pace. This is partly because of the country\u2019s outdated patchwork of state rules. The UK and others are further ahead in addressing this emerging sector in a fresh way. Creating a modern, federal regime to oversee these firms is a priority for U.S. policymakers. Many of the new so-called \u201cfintech\u201d firms fall under the categories of money transmitters or consumer lenders, businesses that require licenses from nearly 50 states, each of which has different standards, not to mention regulatory examiners with varying degrees of sophistication. That means 165-year-old Western Union is regulated the same way that a bitcoin-based transfer startup with fewer than 50 employees might be. For freshly minted companies in the space, state compliance can be prohibitive, costing more than $1 million annually. Marketplace lenders that directly provide loans are also under state jurisdiction. Take SoFi, a San Francisco startup, which makes loans. The company led by former Wells Fargo banker Mike Cagney, and which raised $1 billion, has 18 state licenses for consumer lending and nearly 20 more for mortgages. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established after the 2008 financial crisis, is the federal watchdog now looking out for fintech customers, a critical role in a landscape where algorithms have replaced credit scores to determine borrowing. But the agency\u2019s mandate is limited and doesn\u2019t address risks to the broader financial system. The sector is not large enough to spark those concerns, but it could in the future. Yet it\u2019s not yet clear who at the federal level has jurisdiction. Regulators need to figure this out fast, and account for the different business models many of these firms have from traditional banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is looking at ways to evaluate some of the new products. The Federal Reserve could be ideal as it can see the interconnectivity between fintech and the banking sector to assess risks. Banks are partnering with some of these startups and purchasing their loans. Other countries have already moved forward. This year Britain established a startup unit to help firms thinking of becoming banks, and later will accept proposals for their \u201cregulatory sandbox\u201d program in which companies can test products. Eventually, an international framework will be needed since many of these enterprises encompass global, borderless businesses. The industry is quickly evolving and regulators need to innovate, too.', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Gina Chon'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUS78020326120160309', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 9, 13, 20), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'American oversight of financial tech looks so 2007'}, {'articleText': u' TOKYO A deadline for a court-mandated investigation into why bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox failed, and whether it should be revived under bankruptcy protection laws, has been extended to May 9, the company said in a brief statement on Friday. The Tokyo District Court had set a Friday deadline for Nobuaki Kobayashi, a partner at Nagashima Ohno & Tsunematsu, to report on his investigation into the collapse last month of what was once the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange. In seeking the extension, Kobayashi cited the involvement of investigatory agencies as well as the work required to confirm Mt. Gox\'s financial situation, according to a petition filed to the court. Mt. Gox said on Wednesday it had submitted records and documents to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police as part of its civil rehabilitation application. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo on February 28, saying 750,000 bitcoins belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own bitcoins were stolen by hackers who exploited a security flaw in its software.

Financial and law enforcement authorities have previously warned of the security risk posed by virtual currencies, which use encryption systems to reliably process transactions while being difficult for authorities to trace. "We\'re seeing that virtual currencies are being used as an instrument to facilitate crime, particularly in regard to the laundering of illicit profits," said Europol head Rob Wainwright, speaking on the margins of a nuclear security conference in The Hague. U.S. authorities last year moved to shut down Silk Road, an underground marketplace which allowed participants to settle their accounts anonymously using Bitcoin. Ross Ulbricht, its alleged founder, also faces money laundering charges. His trial is due to start in November. Wainwright said police should be given new powers to allow them to identify anonymous participants online and bring them to justice. Europol has no policing powers of its own, but acts to coordinate policing and cross-border investigations between the 28 member countries of the European Union. Wainwright said police do not have sufficient capabilities to operate online and identify anonymous groups that are using dark areas of the internet. "Criminals are abusing those freedoms and damaging society and threatening the security of millions," he said.

Cheng Le, 22, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan after a jury in August found him guilty on charges including that he attempted to possess a biological toxin for use as a weapon. Nathan said Le, who attended NYU to study physics but left school early, deserved a severe sentence in light of the "horrible, serious and quite terrifying offense" he committed through sophisticated means. "He used the Dark Web to acquire the biological toxin ricin," she said. During a rambling statement in court, Le said he planned to appeal, but said of the case: "Not a day goes by that I do not think of all of things I could have done." The case came amid efforts by law enforcement to crack down on illegal activity involving online black markets operating on a hidden network of websites that can only be accessed using specialized browsers. The marketplaces included Evolution, which before its abrupt March closing became the largest after the Federal Bureau of Investigation\'s 2013 seizure of Silk Road, where drugs and other items could be bought using the digital currency bitcoin. Prosecutors said that in December 2014, Le, going by "WhenInDoubt," contacted an Evolution vendor called "Dark_Mart" about buying ricin. In messages to the vendor, who was actually an FBI employee, Le discussed plans to sell the ricin as "simple and easy death pills" to customers for their own use. Prosecutors said Le discussed wanting the ricin pills included in a bottle with ordinary vitamins, so when a target took the pills daily, "sooner or later he\'d ingest that poisonous pill and die." Le wrote, "After all, it is death itself we\'re selling here, and the more risk-free, the more efficient we can make it, the better," prosecutors said. The FBI shipped fake ricin to Le, who, wearing latex gloves, retrieved the shipment and took its contents to his apartment. He was arrested at his apartment, where authorities found not only the fake ricin but castor oil bean seeds, ricin\'s source, and Le\'s computer, which was logged onto the website.

London has worked hard to cultivate its reputation as a top\nglobal location for so-called "fintech" firms -- technology\nstartups that aim to compete with traditional banking and\nfinancial services, such as money transfer company TransferWise,\ncrowdfunding platform Crowdcube and peer-to-peer lender\nRateSetter. The British capital is in a fierce race with San Francisco,\nNew York, Berlin and Hong Kong to remain a leader in the\nfast-growing sector, an ambition outlined by Finance Minister\nGeorge Osborne in 2014. But as a June 23 referendum on British membership in the EU\nnears, the industry is worried London will lose momentum and its\nreputation for innovation if Britain has to renegotiate its\ntrading relationship with the EU or deal with economic fallout\nfrom an "Out" vote. Seven out of 10 London-based fintech companies interviewed\nby Reuters said they might move their headquarters. Two said\nthey would definitely stay, and one declined to comment either\nway. All 10 said British exit from the EU, or "Brexit", was a\nserious concern for their businesses. "I don\'t think there\'s a contingency plan, which is part of\nmy personal concern," Eileen Burbidge, a partner at venture\ncapital firm Passion Capital, which has backed corporate\ninformation company DueDil, bitcoin exchange Coinfloor and\nonline payments firm GoCardless. "I think there would be a bit of a reset of people, offices,\nHQs and activities if Britain were to leave Europe," added\nBurbidge, who also serves as the British Treasury\'s envoy for\nfintech and chairwoman of government agency Tech City UK. London Mayor Boris Johnson has been a particularly\nenthusiastic booster of fintech, which marries the city\'s\nlongstanding strength as one of the world\'s top financial\ncapitals with its more recent success as a tech startup hub. He has since emerged as one of the leading voices calling\nfor Britain to leave the EU. A spokesman for Johnson declined to\ncomment for this story. In general however, campaigners to take\nBritain out of the European Union say threats by companies to\nleave London are overblown. "It\'s absolutely ridiculous. Companies said they\'d do this\nif we didn\'t join the euro, and how many of them up and left\nwhen we didn\'t?" Jordan Ryan, a spokesman for "Out" campaign\ngroup Leave.EU, said. "Nobody\'s going anywhere. It happens every\nsingle vote." UNDER THREAT Britain\'s London-focused fintech sector was the biggest in\nthe world last year, earning 6.6 billion pounds ($9.4 billion)\nin revenue to beat California and New York, according to a\nreport by accounting firm EY commissioned by the British\ngovernment. While that is still a pittance compared to the revenue of\ntraditional banks -- on its own JP Morgan Chase brings in 10\ntimes as much -- the nascent sector is one of the fastest\ngrowing in the world. More people work in fintech in Britain than in Singapore,\nHong Kong, Germany and Australia combined. (bit.ly/1QEqELR) Investors injected over $700 million into British fintech\nlast year, the report said, encouraged by accommodating\nregulation and the ease of doing business in other European\nmarkets from London. But startups that had flocked from all corners of the world\nare nervous about losing access to European customers, tech\ntalent and funding. Members-only fintech association Innovate Finance said a\nsurvey showed 82 percent of firms wanted Britain to stay in the\nEU, believing Brexit would be a "disaster" and isolate London\nfrom the wider industry. About a quarter of the London-based\ntrade group\'s member firms are run by CEOs from other EU\ncountries. "Would there be a flight of capital out of the UK? Would\ninvestors be spooked? All of it is so uncertain that it\'s\ndangerous," said Dan Gandesha, CEO of real estate crowdfunding\nplatform Property Partner. Some consider English-speaking Dublin or multi-lingual\nLuxembourg potential successors to London\'s fintech mantle in\nEurope, but a German city seems most likely as fintech firms\nthere raised about $550 million last year, only slightly less\nthan in Britain. "Other cities such as Berlin or Paris would start to look\nmore appealing than London as a European hub," said Taavet\nHinrikus, chief executive of TransferWise, which is backed by\nBritish billionaire Richard Branson. "I hope we don\'t have to make that decision, but yes we are\nconsidering our options at the moment." Firms whose business models rely on being part of the EU are\nparticularly worried. Monese, which provides European immigrants\nto Britain with bank accounts "in minutes" via a mobile app, has\nbegun thinking of post-Brexit options as the number of migrants\ncould sharply decrease. "We would rather it didn\'t happen," Monese Vice President of\nGrowth Mulenga Agley told Reuters, saying the company might\ndecide to shift its main business from Britain to mainland\nEurope and focus on customers migrating to and within the\ncontinent. "(Brexit) would make us seriously consider whether we should\nbe in the U.S., rather than the UK," Property Partner\'s Gandesha\nsaid, pointing to reduced growth opportunities in Europe. Other firms expect Brexit to upset operations, but not\nenough to make them move. International payments company Currency Cloud said it would\nstay in Britain as it needed to keep strong ties with what it\nsees as the world\'s unmatched foreign exchange capital. The firm\nis backed by Sapphire Ventures and Japan\'s Rakuten. CEO Mike Laven said, however, that as Brexit would raise\ncosts and inhibit growth, he would probably have to focus more\non growing the firm in Europe to "keep things going correctly". "Would (London) be the right place for all of our jobs? I\'m\nnot sure."\n($1 = 0.7021 pounds)\n\n (Reporting by Richa Naidu, editing by Sinead Cruise and Peter\nGraff)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Richa Naidu'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N15U367', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 8, 11, 9), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"London's fintech stars consider leaving as 'Brexit' threat looms"}, {'articleText': u" March 18 The following are the top stories on\nthe New York Times business pages.

Ransomware, one of the fastest-growing types of cyber\nthreats, encrypts data on infected machines, then typically asks\nusers to pay ransoms in hard-to-trace digital currencies to get\nan electronic key so they can retrieve their data. Security experts estimate that ransoms total hundreds of\nmillions of dollars a year from such cyber criminals, who\ntypically target users of Microsoft Corp\'s Windows\noperating system. Palo Alto Threat Intelligence Director Ryan Olson said the\n"KeRanger" malware, which appeared on Friday, was the first\nfunctioning ransomware attacking Apple\'s Mac computers. "This is the first one in the wild that is definitely\nfunctional, encrypts your files and seeks a ransom," Olson said\nin a telephone interview. Hackers infected Macs through a tainted copy of a popular\nprogram known as Transmission, which is used to transfer data\nthrough the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing network, Palo\nAlto said on a blog posted on Sunday afternoon. When users downloaded version 2.90 of Transmission, which\nwas released on Friday, their Macs were infected with the\nransomware, the blog said. An Apple representative said the company had taken steps\nover the weekend to prevent further infections by revoking a\ndigital certificate that enabled the rogue software to install\non Macs. The representative declined to provide other details. Transmission responded by removing the malicious version of\nits software from its website, www.transmissionbt.com. On Sunday\nit released a version that its website said automatically\nremoves the ransomware from infected Macs. The website advised Transmission users to immediately\ninstall the new update, version 2.92, if they suspected they\nmight be infected. Palo Alto said on its blog that KeRanger is programmed to\nstay quiet for three days after infecting a computer, then\nconnect to the attacker\'s server and start encrypting files so\nthey cannot be accessed. After encryption is completed, KeRanger demands a ransom of\n1 bitcoin, or about $400, the blog said. (bit.ly/1Rvroxv) Olson, the Palo Alto threat intelligence director, said that\nthe victims whose machines were compromised but not cleaned up\ncould start losing access to data on Monday, which is three days\nafter the virus was loaded onto Transmission\'s site. Representatives with Transmission could not be reached for\ncomment. \n\n (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Sandra Maler)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N16E0HZ', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 6, 19, 7), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'UPDATE 1-Apple users targeted in first known Mac ransomware campaign'}, {'articleText': u' LONDON, March 7 Regulators trying to police\ninnovations in financial technology  are waiting to see whether\nstart-ups develop open systems or ones that allow only limited\naccess for users, a Bank of England conference heard on Monday. Regulators are looking into new rules for so-called fintech,\nwhich includes peer-to-peer lending, and the use of blockchain\nor the distributed ledger technology underpinning the bitcoin\nvirtual currency. The sector is still tiny but regulators worry it could grow\nquickly and pose risks to the financial system. "We need to understand what the model is," Bank of England\nChief Cashier, Victoria Cleland, told the conference jointly\norganised by the BoE and London Business School. The BoE is trying to "join the dots" between the potential\nbenefits and risks from digital currencies, blockchain and other\ninnovations, she said. "With all these things going on, we need to be ready to\nrespond to what would regulation mean," Cleland. Banks are examining blockchain uses to avoid being caught\nout like the taxi sector has been by online cab finder Uber or\nhoteliers by online accommodation company Airbnb, the conference\nheard. But there is fierce debate over what sort of businesss model\nis best, and whether it should be an open system that can be\naccessed by the general public via the Internet, or a closed or\npermissioned one with users vetted. Andrew Weir, group chief technology officer at HSBC \nbank, said most big organisations were under constant attack\nfrom hackers. "If the distributed ledger is a platform that gets\nincorporated into the Internet in some way, it will be\ncompletely open to these forms of hacking," Weir said. Charley Cooper, managing director of R3 Group, a consortium\nof 42 banks, including HSBC, looking at ways to use blockchain\nfor trading bonds, said he has invited regulators to view their\nwork. "I don\'t know that there is any regulator in the world that\nis anywhere near close to accepting the idea of a public\ndistributed ledger for financial services," Cooper said.

"Our preference at Berkshire is to keep buying big operating businesses," the billionaire investor said in an interview on CNBC. "In terms of building Berkshire for the long term, we just like adding earning power, big chunks of earning power." However, he added that stock holdings were "generally for very long term." The interview came two days after Buffett released his annual letter to shareholders, in which he signaled that his hunt for "elephants," or large acquisitions, continues. That business-buying strategy has helped Buffett build Berkshire over the decades so it now holds dozens of businesses, from ice cream to insurance. With Berkshire\'s range of businesses and stock holdings, some analysts compare Berkshire to an index fund tied to the health of the U.S. economy, the world\'s biggest, in which Buffett has expressed strong optimism in recent years. But as Berkshire has grown, regulators are now weighing whether Berkshire Hathaway should be considered a systemically important financial institution, or one that is too big to fail, Bloomberg reported earlier this year. "We\'ve heard absolutely nothing from the people in charge of what\'s called SIFI," Buffett said on CNBC on Monday. As he\'s done over the years, Buffett encouraged investors of all sizes and stripes to put their money to work, potentially earning greater returns than by simply holding cash. Still, in emphasizing productive assets, he noted at least one investment in which he is not bullish: bitcoin. "It\'s not a currency," he said flatly. Mt. Gox, once the world\'s biggest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy on Friday, underscoring the growing pains facing the world of cryptocurrencies. "I wouldn\'t be surprised if it\'s not around in 10 to 20 years," he added.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan scheduled\nthe trial for Nov. 3 as Ross Ulbricht, 29, pleaded not guilty to\na four-count indictment unveiled on Tuesday. The charges include\nmoney laundering conspiracy and engaging in a continuing\ncriminal enterprise. "I know your client is in custody, so I\'m sure you\'d like to\nget this done sooner rather than later," Forrest said to\nUlbricht\'s lawyer on Friday. Ulbricht, who prosecutors say went online by the name "Dread\nPirate Roberts", has been incarcerated since his arrest in\nOctober. Prosecutors say that Ulbricht owned and operated Silk Road,\nwhich they allege sold drugs and criminal services in exchange\nfor the digital currency bitcoin. The bulk of the items for sale on Silk Road were illegal\ndrugs including heroin, cocaine and ecstasy, prosecutors say.\nThe site also carried listings for computer hacking services,\nforgeries and malicious software, according to authorities. Prosecutors say that Ulbricht, managing a small staff of\npaid site administrators, reaped tens of millions of dollars in\ncommissions through Silk Road. The indictment charges Ulbricht with one count each of\nnarcotics conspiracy, engaging in a continuing criminal\nenterprise, conspiracy to commit computer hacking and money\nlaundering conspiracy. U.S. authorities have to date seized 173,991 bitcoins that\nat current exchange rates are worth more than $130 million,\naccording to CoinDesk, a bitcoin price index publisher.

Serrin Turner, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\'s Office who also led the prosecution of the digital currency service Liberty Reserve, will join Latham as a partner in New York, the law firm said on Monday. His hiring comes as amid growing attention among law firm clients to cyber security threats following a slew of damaging cyberattacks against private companies and U.S. government agencies in the last few years. "In the cyber area in particular, we have more demand than we have lawyers to serve it at the moment," said Miles Ruthberg, the chair of Latham\'s New York litigation and trial department. "That\'s not surprising given everything we know that\'s happening."  Turner, who will join the firm in late March will focus on cybersecurity and data-protection issues, worked in the U.S. Attorney\'s Office\'s criminal division since 2010 and served as its cybercrime coordinator. In his highest-profile case, Turner was the lead prosecutor in the case of Ross Ulbricht, the accused mastermind behind Silk Road, an underground website that enabled more than $200 million of anonymous drug sales using the digital currency bitcoin. Ulbricht, who prosecutors said operated the website under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, was arrested in 2013 as authorities seized the website. A federal jury found Ulbricht guilty of charges including that he distributed drugs through the Internet, and he was sentenced in May 2015 to life in prison. He is appealing. In an interview, Turner said the investigation demonstrated that even in the case of a website like Silk Road, which was designed to be beyond the reach of law enforcement, authorities could still hold those behind it accountable. "That\'s the challenge with cybercrime in general, to make sure crimes cannot be committed on the Internet without any remedy or recourse," he said. Turner also oversaw the prosecution of Liberty Reserve, which prosecutors said laundered more than $6 billion for criminals involved in Ponzi schemes, hacking, child pornography and drug trafficking. Prosecutors secured guilty pleas from five individuals tied to Liberty Reserve, including most recently Arthur Budovsky, Liberty Reserve\'s co-founder who pleaded guilty in January on the eve of trial.

FSB Chairman Mark Carney said in a letter to central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20 economies meeting in Shanghai that assessing the systemic implications of fintech innovations would form part of the task force\'s core policy work this year. It marks the first time that regulators at the global level have begun scrutinizing fintech, a sector that includes blockchain, the distributed ledger technology underpinning bitcoin that proponents say could radically change payments systems. So far regulators have been treading carefully as countries such as Britain are wary of crimping a sector that is still tiny compared with banking, but could create many new jobs in future. "The regulatory framework must ensure that it is able to manage any systemic risks that may arise from technological change without stifling innovation," Carney said. The FSB will discuss its findings in March and consider its next steps, he added. Carney, who is also Governor of the Bank of England, said the more difficult economic and financial conditions since the start of this year partly reflect weaker growth prospects. Banking shares have come under pressure, reflecting concerns that lenders have to do more to adjust their long-term business models to a lower growth, lower nominal interest rate environment, Carney said. Carney said the FSB will report in September on whether there has been a reduction in market liquidity and, if so, its extent, drivers and likely persistence. Banks and central bankers have locked horns over why liquidity in secondary bond markets has thinned, with bankers blaming tougher regulation introduced by the FSB and others since the 2007-09 financial crisis. Central bankers say much of the heavier liquidity in markets before the crisis was "illusory" with insufficient evidence so far to show that some of the new rules need rolling back.  ASSET MANAGERS IN SIGHT Linked to the liquidity issue is a worry that asset managers could not cope with heavy redemptions, or investors pulling money out of bond funds en masse. "We have prioritized work to analyze structural vulnerabilities in asset management activities and to identify risks that may merit policy responses in four areas," Carney said. The FSB, which sets global standards implemented by G20 member countries, will issue policy recommendations in September after looking at leverage in funds, and their operational risks and securities lending activities. "An over-optimistic \'liquidity illusion\' may have been reinforced by the growth of investment products offering redemptions at very short notice," Carney said. Policies to reduce "fire-sale" risks in open-ended investment funds may also help, he said. Carney said IOSCO, which groups global securities markets regulators, will publish by December a "toolkit" of measures to promote proper conduct by individuals and firms in markets. Global regulators will also consult on more detailed rules to prevent clearing houses, which stand between two sides of a derivatives trade, from becoming "too big to fail" due to their size and reach, Carney said.

Proponents of blockchain or distributed ledger technology\nargue it has the power to radically innovate in areas of\nfinancial services such as payments. Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at\nthe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said many regulatory and\nconsumer issues need to be discussed as the technology evolves,\nsuch as who controls access to it and data security. "The FCA continues to monitor the development of this\ntechnology but is yet to take a stance until its application is\nclearer," Woolard said in a speech published on Tuesday. Blockchain technology builds up a massive ledger of\ntransactions that is verified and shared by a global network of\ncomputers. "The current development of distributed ledger technology\nhas the potential to revolutionise financial services; whether\nit is the panacea of all ills in the financial world is yet to\nbe seen," Woolard said. U.S. start up Digital Asset Holdings has won heavyweight\nbacking from JP Morgan, Deutsche Boerse,\nAccenture and others to develop the use of blockchain in\nfinancial services such as in settling trades. Lawyers say this will raise the need for new rules for banks\nand exchanges to show regulators that adequate controls are in\nplace to mitigate risks to the wider financial system. Last month the European Commission, which has powers to\npropose pan-European Union regulation in the financial sector,\nsaid it will monitor rather than regulate blockchain. Woolard\'s speech was part of a week of financial technology\n(fintech) events hosted by Britain\'s finance ministry. The\ngovernment wants to encourage start up companies to innovate in\nfinancial services. Yet lawyers say there is a natural tension between the\ngovernment, which wants the fintech sector to grow, and the job\nof regulators to write rules. Woolard said part of the FCA\'s remit is to promote\ncompetition and it wants start ups to meet with the watchdog\nearly on to ensure consumer protection has been properly\nconsidered. The FCA is helping several companies obtain authorisation,\nsuch as WealthKernel, which wants to provide automated wealth\nmanagement advice to institutional customers, he said. Woolard said the FCA had just authorised CUVVA, which\nprovides car insurance for periods as short as a few hours so\npeople can borrow a friend\'s vehicle.\n\n (Editing by David Holmes)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Huw Jones'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1623LQ', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 23, 10, 28), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'UK watchdog in no rush to regulate blockchain technology'}, {'articleText': u' Nov 21 Alix Resources Corp :\n * Provides update on bitcoins\n * Says will not be proceeding with the implementation of a\nbitcoin exchange at this time\n * Says intends to continue its proposed bitcoin service payment\nplan with its mining service providers\n * Source text for Eikon \n * Further company coverage', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSASA08G8R20131121', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 21, 11, 40), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BRIEF-Alix provides update on bitcoins'}, {'articleText': u' Feb 6 The following are the top stories in the\nWall Street Journal.

Wearing leg shackles and a red jail uniform, Ross William\nUlbricht was led into the San Francisco court room, where he was\nrepresented by a public defender during the 10-minute\nproceeding. U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero rescheduled the bail\nhearing until next Wednesday after public defender Brandon\nLeBlanc asked for more time. LeBlanc told reporters his client\ndenied all charges. The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Ulbricht on\nTuesday and accused him of running the Silk Road website, a\nmarket place for illegal goods, under the online alias "Dread\nPirate Roberts." Authorities said they seized $3.6 million worth of the\nbitcoin digital currency, which was used instead of cash or\ncredit cards to complete transactions for drugs and other\nillegal merchandise. Federal prosecutors in New York have charged him with one\ncount each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking\nconspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, according to court\nfilings. They also say Ulbricht tried to have someone killed who had\nthreatened to expose the identities of thousands of Silk Road\nusers unless Ulbricht sent him money. For more than two years, Silk Road allowed thousands of\ntech-savvy sellers to post ads for drugs and other illegal\nproducts, which they shipped to customers through the mail. Like eBay, which does not permit the sale of\nillegal products, sellers on Silk Road depended on positive\nreviews left by their customers in order to maintain good\nreputations and generate more sales. Bitcoins, which provide a degree of privacy in online\ntransactions, can be stored in "wallets" kept online or on\nindividual personal computers. According to the complaint, Ulbricht, whose alleged online\nalias comes from the Princess Bride novel and movie, operated\nthe Silk Road site from his apartment and nearby Internet cafes\nin San Francisco. The site also offered tutorials on hacking ATM machines,\ncontact lists for black market connections and counterfeiters,\nand guns and hit men for sale, according to the charges. Authorities said Ulbricht\'s website generated sales of more\nthan 9.5 million bitcoins, roughly equivalent to $1.2 billion.\nBitcoin exists solely in cyber form, and some devotees promote\nit as the future of money.

A number of senior officials have raised questions about the\nnote - one of the highest-valued in the world - saying it makes\nit easier to carry around large sums and launder cash, going as\nfar as calling for it to be scrapped. The issue came into particularly harsh focus after the Nov.\n13 attacks in Paris - though a Reuters investigation suggested\nmilitants may have spent as little as $7,500 on the operation. "We are going to ask the ECB to look at cash money and the\naccessibility of the 500 euro note," the chair of a monthly\nmeeting of EU finance ministers, the Netherlands\' Jeroen\nDijsselbloem, told reporters. "There are risks that large notes and large cash amounts can\nbe easily used for terrorism financing," Dijsselbloem said. The notes make up almost 30 percent of the euros held in\ncash and are more than five times the value of the largest U.S.\nnote - the $100 bill. The European Commission last week also proposed increasing\ncontrols on prepaid payment cards, virtual currencies such as\nbitcoin and other possible source of financing for militant\ngroups. EU Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said the\nresults of a study into the feasibility on cash payment limits\nwould be presented by May. Britain and Austria apply no limits to consumers\' cash\npayments, while France imposes a ceiling of 3,000 euros for\npayments made by French residents. Germany has no limit either but is considering adopting a\n5,000 euro ceiling. Italy plans to raise its ceiling from 1,000\nto 3,000 euros, in a move the government believes could boost\nretail sales. Germany was one of the early champions of the 500-euro note\nto match the value of its old 1,000-mark note, valued by its\ncitizens many of whom prefer cash over electronic money.\n\n (Editing by Jeremy Gaunt and Andrew Heavens)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N15R1XH', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 12, 10, 25), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'UPDATE 1-Ministers call for action on 500-euro note to cut militant funding'}, {'articleText': u' BRUSSELS Feb 12 The European Central Bank\nshould make proposals on how to reduce security risks linked to\nthe 500 euro note which can be used for the financing of\nterrorism, the head of euro zone finance ministers said on\nFriday. Almost 30 percent of the more than 1 trillion euros ($1.1\ntrillion) of cash in circulation last year was hoarded in 500\neuro notes, ECB data show. The banknote is one of the most valuable worldwide, with a\nvalue more than five times higher than the largest U.S.\nequivalent currently in circulation, the $100 bill. "We are going to ask the ECB to look at cash money and the\naccessibility of the 500 euro note," Dutch Finance Minister\nJeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters ahead of a meeting of EU\nfinance ministers in Brussels. "There are risks that large notes and large cash amounts can\nbe easily used for terrorism financing," Dijsselbloem, who is \npermanent head of euro zone finance ministers, said. The request for a probe on the 500 euro note comes amid an\nEU clampdown on all means of payment that may be used to finance\nterrorist acts. It was triggered by the attacks in Paris last\nNovember by Islamic State militants that killed 130 people. The European Commission, the EU executive arm, proposed last\nweek to increase controls on prepaid payment cards, virtual\ncurrencies such as bitcoin and other possible source of\nfinancing for terrorist organisations. It also warned about the risks of 500 euro notes, mulling\npossible ceilings on cash payments. The ECB is in charge of making decisions on the eruo\nbanknotes in circulation. The 500 euro note has raised concerns also in relation to\nfraud and corruption. In an interview in January, the top EU\nanti-fraud official called for the banknote to be\nwithdrawn. When euro notes and coins began to circulate in 2002,\nGermany was among the main supporters of having a 500 euro\nbanknote to match the value of its 1,000-mark note, and cater to\nGermans\' traditional preference for cash over electronic money. \n \n\n (Editing by Jeremy Gaunt.)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'Francesco Guarascio'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N15R1QU', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 12, 4, 28), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"EU finance ministers' head urges ECB to study security risks of 500 euro banknote"}, {'articleText': None, 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2016/05/03/baidu-shows-health-is-a-huge-flashpoint-in-china/', 'timestamp': None, 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': None}, {'articleText': u' FRANKFURT Financial regulators are warming up to new uses for "blockchain" technology, which promises tamper-proof communication and makes many types of transactions far more secure, Blythe Masters, the head of one firm in the market, told Reuters.

"Regulators are very interested in the potential of this technology to improve transparency, audit trails, transaction reporting and reduce operational risk," said Masters, who runs blockchain start-up Digital Asset Holding. Blockchain technology builds up a massive ledger of transactions that is verified and shared by a global network of computers. Any two parties can use it to exchange information including stock deals and legal contracts, with no need for a central body to verify each transaction. Masters said many post-trade infrastructures were outdated and required new technologies such as blockchain to support them in a hugely challenging environment. "More broadly, (regulators) hope the blockchain technology can be beneficial to the economy," she said, adding that they had begun to focus more on the technology\'s benefits and less on the potential risks. Banks reckon the nascent technology could save them money by making their operations faster, more efficient and more transparent.  Regulators, however, have previously said it could reduce the role of intermediaries such as banks and settlement houses. They have also said the technology did not fit easily into existing regulatory frameworks. Over the past year, however, interest in blockchain technology has grown rapidly. It has already attracted investment from many major financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Boerse. Considered the most high-profile woman on Wall Street when she left JPMorgan in 2014 after 27 years, Masters signaled that it was not her goal to sell the start-up at the next best opportunity. "The greatest benefits of this technology are extracted if you have multi-party participation," Masters said, adding that competition for the technology was intense. "There are other startups. There are giant technology firms, and there is competition from in-house development at potential clients who have to evaluate if they want to build or buy." Industry observers believe large technology groups such as IBM, Google, Intel and Cisco could one day join in on the technology. "This is as significant as 25 years ago the Internet was," Masters said.

Banking regulators in California, New York and Virginia in recent weeks have issued letters saying the companies need to follow the state rules or prove that the rules do not apply to them, the Journal said. "Virtual currency firms inhabit an evolving and sometimes murky corner of the financial world," Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\'s Department of Financial Services, told the WSJ in an interview. "The extent and nature of their operations morph constantly, so it\'s important for regulators to ask the hard questions and stay ahead of the curve in order to root out dangerous or illegal activity," Lawsky said. Spokespeople for California banking department and Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions declined to comment to the Journal. (link.reuters.com/wuq29t) Most money transmission rules require companies to provide detailed financial data, business strategy and information about the management. States also usually require companies to put up a bond of several million dollars. Digital currency is electronic money that can be passed between individuals without the use of the traditional banking or money transfer system. Bitcoin, which has been embraced by a number of venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, exists through an open-source software program that any users with enough skill and computing power can access. It is not managed by a single company or government. Users can buy bitcoins through exchanges that convert real money into the virtual currency. None of the parties could immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours.

Arthur Budovsky, 42, admitted he knew Costan Rican-based Liberty Reserve was "susceptible" to be used by criminals, including for Ponzi schemes. He pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to a money laundering conspiracy charge. "I knew what I did was illegal," Budovsky, in blue jail clothing, told U.S. District Judge Denise Cote. Budovsky faces up to 20 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced May 6. Liberty Reserve operated what U.S. prosecutors called one of the world\'s most widely used digital currency services, which was used by criminals involved in hacking, child pornography and drug trafficking. The company was shuttered in May 2013 amid U.S. efforts to crack down on the use of digital currencies including bitcoin to evade law enforcement and launder illicit proceeds.

U.S. prosecutors in an indictment unsealed on Tuesday said that is precisely what the Costa Rican-based Liberty Reserve was doing. The website for Liberty Reserve has now been seized by the United States Global Illicit Financial Team and prominently displays logos for the Department of Justice, the Department of Treasury and the Secret Service. But older versions of the firm\'s website, which can be found in the Internet Archive\'s Wayback machine (archive.org/web/web.php) offer a glimpse into Liberty Reserve\'s past, before most people had ever heard of it. The versions say Liberty Reserve has the "right to refuse a transaction at any time should suspicion arise that it may be connected to money laundering or criminal activity." The policy also said the company would not do business with anyone using funds from "sources by an illegal activity." The website provided instructions on how users of Liberty Reserve could go to a number of "exchangers," which the firm said, "will be happy to buy or sell your LR." LR is how Liberty Reserve referred to its own form of digital currency that authorities say was used to enable criminals to launder money from illegal activities like selling drugs and child porn. The digital currency could be exchanged into cash. The company also boasted of a product called "LibertyGuard", which it said was a plug-in on Firefox browsers that would ensure users\' transactions were secure. In connection with the indictment, authorities in Spain, Costa Rica and New York said they had arrested five people on Friday and seized bank accounts and Internet domains associated with the company, Liberty Reserve. Costa Rican prosecutor Jos\xe9 Pablo Gonz\xe1lez said Liberty Reserve and related businesses were used to launder funds from child pornography websites and from drug trafficking. Over the past decade, digital currency has become more popular. The most widely known is called Bitcoin. Liberty Reserve\'s currency was not connected to Bitcoin.

It will also fund an initial phase of development and acquire a warrant that will give it the right to purchase further equity and appoint a director to the board.  Nasdaq Inc, the exchange and clearing house operator where many global tech giants are listed, is testing the ground with blockchain technology on its market for private companies, Nasdaq Private Market. It completed its first transaction using the technology in December.    Other exchange operators, including Deutsche Boerse and London Stock Exchange have joined hands with financial services and tech heavyweights to build platforms and applications using the blockchain technology. ASX will work with Digital Asset to design a new post-trade solution for the Australian equity market. Digital Asset\'s post-trade solutions will meet the regulatory, operational and security standards that apply to Australia\u2019s financial markets, ASX added. ASX shares rose in line with the broader market on Friday, closing up 1.3 percent.

France, which has championed the security clampdown, has\ncalled for strict limits on the use of prepaid payment cards\nwhich, according to French investigators, were used to fund the\nParis attacks claimed by the Islamic State militant group. "We aim to present an action plan setting out a series of\nmeasures, including legislative ones, ahead of the next Ecofin\nmeeting in February," Commission Vice-President Valdis\nDombrovskis told a news conference on Friday at the end of a\nmeeting of EU finance ministers, known as Ecofin. The next meeting is scheduled for Feb. 12. EU member\ngovernments must approve the Commission measures for them to\ntake effect. "In February we can take decisive next steps on the issue of\nfighting the financing of terrorism," the head of the EU finance\nministers group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said. He added that some measures might be applied more rapidly,\nsuch as the freezing of assets of suspected militants. An EU official said that prepaid cards were among the means\nof payment under scrutiny together with virtual currencies, such\nas Bitcoin, and several others that allow anonymous\ntransactions. Prepaid cards are issued by a wide range of operators\nincluding major market actors such as Visa and Mastercard\n. They are different from debit and credit cards because\nthey need to be loaded before payments can be made, but can\ncarry substantial amounts of money. A successful crackdown on this means of payment would imply\nclose coordination with non-EU countries, the EU official said.

Finance ministers of the United Nations Security Council\'s\nmember countries are meeting in New York to pass a resolution to\ncut funding for Islamic State. Before the meeting, Michel Sapin said it was crucial to deal\nwith smaller, hidden transactions to prevent attacks, which he\nsaid could be financed with as little as 10,000 to 30,000 euros\n($10,800 to $32,400). "The characteristic of this terrorism is that it is low-cost\nterrorism but with considerable impact," Sapin told reporters in\nNew York before meeting U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. "If we want to avoid these acts we have to have a larger\ncapacity to spot these small movements that can take place in\ndangerous circles or among individuals that could be dangerous." Sapin pointed specifically to the use of pre-paid bank cards\nwhich can be charged by individuals for hundreds of euros and\ntransferred across frontiers to another card. Neither cardholder\nneeds to identify themselves. French authorities say the system was used by the Paris\nattackers to transfer money for the Paris attacks between\nBelgium and France. "The idea is not to ban the technology because it\'s badly\nused, but to see how the anonymity can be stopped," he said.\n"This all depends on the quality of information exchange between\ncountries." Sapin also said he wanted to target means of payment such as\ndigital currency bitcoin, or mobile phone apps that facilitate\ncash transfers. "Carrying bundles of cash in bags is no longer used.\nTerrorists have a capacity to use all the new technologies to\ntransfer money around so we need together have identical rules\nin countries," he said. France and Germany already want an EU money laundering\ndirective to be implemented into national legislation in member\nstates before the existing deadline of mid-2017. "Regulations have been put in place in France, there is a\ndirective in Europe on this and I want to discuss this with the\nU.S. authorities to see how we could have the same regulations\nacross all countries," Sapin said. French finance ministry officials have been critical of U.S.\nauthorities not answering French requests for access to\nfinancial information concerning suspects tied to last month\'s\nattacks in Paris. \n\n (Reporting By John Irish; Editing by Bill Rigby)', 'publisher': 'Reuters', 'author': {'name': u'John Irish'}, 'url': 'http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1461XL20151217', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 17, 13, 55), 'commentCount': None, 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u"France to press U.S. on 'low-cost' terror financing"}, {'articleText': u' Editor: Malcolm Davidson                 +44 20 7542 6958 Global Picture Desk:                + 65 6870 3775 Global Graphics Desk:                    + 65 6870 3595  (All times GMT / ET) Receive this schedule by email: mediaexpress.reuters.com  TOP STORIES Swiss open probe into forex manipulation ZURICH - Switzerland\'s competition commission WEKO says it\nhas opened an investigation into several Swiss, British and\nAmerican banks over potential collusion to manipulate foreign\nexchange rates.

Roger Thomas Clark, who authorities said went by the online\nmoniker "Variety Jones," was arrested on Thursday to face\nextradition on U.S. charges stemming from his role in helping\nRoss Ulbricht, Silk Road\'s convicted creator. Prosecutors said Clark, 54, was described by Ulbricht as a\ntrusted "mentor" who regularly advised him on the management of\nSilk Road, a website that allowed users to anonymously buy drugs\nusing the virtual currency bitcoin. He faces up to life in prison based on charges of narcotics\nconspiracy and money laundering conspiracy contained in a\ncriminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan. A lawyer for Clark could not be identified. Silk Road operated for more than two years, allowing users\nto buy drugs and other illicit goods and generating $213 million\nin sales in the process, prosecutors said. The website, which relied on the Tor network, was seized by\nU.S. authorities in 2013 as they arrested Ulbricht, Silk Road\'s\nadmitted creator who prosecutors said operated it under the\nalias "Dread Pirate Roberts." Ulbricht, 31, was sentenced in May to life in prison after a\nfederal jury in Manhattan found him guilty on charges including\ndistributing narcotics. According to the complaint, Clark began advising Ulbricht in\n2011. In a digital journal, Ulbricht said Variety Jones advised\nhim on many technical aspects of the website during its initial\nyear, the complaint said. "He\'s been a real mentor," Ulbricht wrote, according to the\ncomplaint. Clark also suggested Ulbricht adopt the pseudonym Dread\nPirate Roberts, an alias borrowed from a character in the 1987\nmovie "The Princess Bride," the complaint said. Prosecutors said Clark also helped Ulbricht develop rules\ngoverning Silk Road\'s vendors and users and advised him on how\nto conceal his involvement with the website and on tactics to\nthwart law enforcement investigations. For his efforts, Clark, who also went by "VJ," "Cimon," and\n"Plural of Mongoose," was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars,\nprosecutors said. The case is U.S. v.

The suggested crackdown follows the Paris attacks on Nov. 13 that killed 130 people and that was partly funded through prepaid cards, French officials said. "Terrorist attacks on European soil in recent years have underscored the need to substantially boost efforts to fight terrorism and terrorist financing at EU level," a French government paper, seen by Reuters, said. The document was sent to European diplomats this week and will form the basis of a discussion at a regular meeting of EU finance ministers on Dec. 8 in Brussels, where terrorism financing is one of the subjects in the formal agenda. "E-money and, particularly, prepaid cards (..) could be very widely used by organized crime, migrant traffickers and terrorists," the French paper said. "Criminal investigation department officers have already found prepaid cards during searches of the homes of individuals belonging to such networks," it said. Prepaid cards are issued by a wide range of operators, including major actors such as Visa (V.N)  and Mastercard (MA.N). They are different from debit and credit cards because they need to be loaded before payments can be made, but can carry substantial amounts of money. The French customs recently seized a Panamanian prepaid e-money card with 250,000 euros stored on it, the document said. Virtual currencies, of which bitcoin is the most widely used, are also seen as a potential cover funding tool as "the lack of transparency due to the total anonymity of transactions makes them impossible to monitor," the French document said. It acknowledged that these transactions are recorded in public databases in some cases.  The French proposed caps on amounts that can be loaded on prepaid cards and limits on the conversion of virtual currencies into legal currencies. Controls on the users of these financial instruments should also be stepped up. A week after the Paris shooting, a crisis meeting of EU interior ministers urged the European Commission to make proposals to "strengthen controls of non-banking payment methods such as electronic/anonymous payments, money remittances, cash-carriers, virtual currencies, transfers of gold or precious metals and pre-paid cards". The Commission, the EU\'s executive, will inform EU finance ministers next week on the next steps to fight terrorism financing, the agenda of the meeting says.  BANK TRANSFERS The French proposal goes beyond the crackdown on non-banking payments and urges ministers to set up a European program to track bank transfers and intercept transactions used by what it called terrorist organizations. A U.S. Terrorist Financing Tracking Program (TFTP) has been in place for more than a decade. Since 2010, it also covers transactions involving European citizens through the SWIFT system, the most widely used platform for bank transactions. European investigators can access bank transfers data involving EU citizens only after a specific request to the U.S. authorities. The French complain about "relatively strict terms" and "slow reaction times" from Washington. "French authorities are in favor of creating an autonomous European TFTP as a complement to the U.S. program which would directly use data on EU citizens," the paper said.  The existing TFTP program is controversial in Europe because of its impact on the privacy of EU citizens and of possible abuses carried out by U.S. intelligence services.

But Masters told Reuters she was fully committed to running her company, Digital Asset Holdings - a startup designed to speed the trading of derivatives by using technology associated with bitcoin. She joined the company as chief executive in March.   "I can\'t think of a better person than Jes Staley, nor a more venerable institution than Barclays, but I am in mid-flight at Digital Asset and fully committed to what we are doing," Masters said. Staley spoke to Masters about joining the bank late next year, the source said. He declined to be named because details of the approach were confidential. A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment. Masters, best known for helping to create the credit-derivatives market in the 1990s, was the most high profile woman on Wall Street when she left JPMorgan last year after a 27 career with the bank. Barclays is shrinking its investment banking business and its current boss, Tom King, threatened to quit in the summer during a row with then-CEO Antony Jenkins over the future of the division, people familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time. Chairman John McFarlane persuaded King to stay, but the row contributed to the ousting of Jenkins shortly after by  McFarlane, the sources said. There has been speculation in the media that King would retire next year. King did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The potential hire would be the latest step in Barclays\' efforts to remake itself after being rocked by a series of scandals, including its role in fixing the benchmark interest-rate known as Libor.          Staley, who used to run JPMorgan\'s investment bank, only started as Barclays chief executive on Tuesday and is under pressure to set out a clear vision for the investment bank, where returns are the weakest in the group and costs need to be cut.    There have been multiple shifts in its strategy in recent years, and it is now focusing on its core U.S. and UK markets and cutting about 7,000 jobs.  CONTROVERSY If Masters joined Barclays, the bank\'s top three executives, including Finance Director Tushar Morzaria, would all be JP Morgan veterans. The U.S. bank\'s alumni feature heavily in the upper echelons of financial services, including Bill Winters, the new chief executive at Standard Chartered, Peter Hancock, the boss at insurer AIG and Charlie Scharf, the chief executive of Visa. Masters, who was born in Oxford and grew up in Britain, started off in JP Morgan as an intern and worked her way up to run the bank\'s commodities trading operation, delivering pep talks to New York traders with a cut glass English accent. A controversial figure, she helped develop and market credit derivatives, which were meant to insure investors if a loan went into default but instead blew huge holes in the balance sheet of financial firms such as insurer AIG during the 2007-08 financial crisis. She was the chief financial officer of JP Morgan\'s investment bank from 2004 to 2007 before switching to run the commodities business, which she built into one of the biggest players in the industry. She was back in the spotlight in July 2013, when JP Morgan agreed to pay $410 million to settle U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allegations that units Masters oversaw manipulated power markets, enriching itself at the expense of California and Midwest residents from 2010 to 2012. JPMorgan sold its physical commodities arm in 2014 as regulatory changes made it a less profitable business for banks, and Masters left the bank.  Michael Holland, who oversees more than $4 billion as founder of Holland & co,  said Masters would be a good choice for the job when judged solely on her merits, but given her past controversies, the optics of the choice could make her a tough sell to investors. "Does Barclays really need this? Because they\'ve had enough headlines over the last few years that have given people pause," he said.

Now a few months later, the total is up to 6,000 grants totaling $7.8 million.  Within hours of something bad happening around the globe - whether its a hurricane or a humanitarian crisis like the flow of refugees from Syria - people start calling places like Fidelity Charitable, to ask where their donations would be most useful.  In the philanthropic circles, motivating folks to give can be a costly and fickle marketing exercise. Donor-advised funds, which operate like mini-foundations, help to bridge the gap. "What we know about individuals, when it comes to disasters, is that they are highly influenced by media coverage and by the type of disaster," said Bob Ottenhoff, president and chief executive officer of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, a nonprofit based in Washington. "That is why so much money flows immediately after there is a certain type of disaster, and it dries up after a couple of days."  Individuals gave an estimated 72 percent of the $358.38 billion donated to charity in 2014, according to Giving USA, with the rest coming from foundations and corporations.  Donor-advised funds make up a very small but growing part of that individual pie, granting $12.5 billion in 2014, up from $9.7 billion in 2013, according to the National Philanthropic Trust, which operates a donor-advised fund. And overall assets held in those accounts rose to $70 billion from $58 billion.  At Fidelity Charitable, one of the largest providers, you will need $5,000 to open a donor-advised fund. Most of those who open accounts like these have planned giving on their minds - to their alma maters, religious organizations, health concerns or local communities. But account holders at Schwab Charitable, for instance, leave about 30 percent of their assets free to fund causes that come along.  "It\'s hard to know how many are pulling a credit card out and donating directly rather than using their donor-advised funds," said Kim Laughton, president of Schwab Charitable. "But I think they understand they can do it quickly through the fund. They can even grant from a cellphone, which is really nice." The advantages of giving through a donor-advised fund are that the money can be set aside and noted on tax returns, but granted later. Also, the fund groups take care of much of the paperwork involved in a donation - especially helpful for non-cash gifts like stocks or even Bitcoin, at some organizations.  Donors should note, however, that brokerage management fees do apply to the accounts, as in regular investment accounts.  While Fidelity and Schwab send out email blasts and newsletter updates to their donor bases when a major disaster occurs, they worry about creating disaster-giving fatigue. This has made some other donor-advised funds very cautious about pushing out notices.  "We wait for donors to come to us, rather than becoming an annoying dinging to them," said Eileen Heisman, president and CEO of the National Philanthropic Trust. All the funds are especially cautious about looking beyond the immediate emotional need to help when they select charities to highlight. That is what Fidelity tried to steer with its Nepal effort, said Elaine Martyn, vice president of the private donor group at Fidelity Charitable. While the website highlighted just a few charities to start, by the time those 6,000 grants were given out, they went to hundreds of different organizations like Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children and smaller ones that focused on eye health and animal welfare, many of which will be providing long-term support for rebuilding. "Lot of donors want to give to the first responders, then they forget about it. There\'s a whole other set of organizations that are good at hanging in there," added Heisman.  Ottenhoff suggests breaking up gifts into two parts, one for immediate need and one for long-term building.  "It should be a time to take a moment of reflection - what do you want to accomplish?

In finding their targets, U.S. military planners have relied\nin part on an unconventional source of intelligence: access to\nbanking records that provide insight into which refineries and\noil pumps are generating cash for the extremist group, current\nand former officials say. The intent is to choke off the Islamic State\'s funding by\ntracking its remaining ties to the global financial system. By\nidentifying money flowing to and from the group, U.S. officials\nhave been able to get a glimpse into how its black-market\neconomy operates, people with knowledge of the effort have said. That in turn has influenced decisions about targeting for\nair strikes in an effort that began before Islamic State\'s Nov.\n13 attacks on Paris and has intensified since, they said. While\nIslamic State\'s access to formal banking has been restricted, it\nretains some ties that U.S. military and financial officials can\nuse against it, the current and former officials said. "We have done a really good job of largely keeping the\nIslamic State out of the formal financial system," said Matthew\nLevitt, who served as deputy assistant secretary for\nintelligence at the U.S. Treasury in the George W. Bush\nadministration. "But we haven\'t been entirely successful, and\nthat may not be a bad thing." Reuters was unable to verify key aspects of the campaign,\nincluding when it started or exactly which facilities have been\ndestroyed as a result. Two current officials who confirmed the\noperations in outline declined to comment on their details. It was unclear how U.S. intelligence, Treasury, and military\nofficials working on what the government calls "counter threat\nfinance" operations have used banking records to identify\nlucrative Islamic State oil-related targets in Syria and whether\nthat involved local banks. A report this year by the intergovernmental Financial Action\nTask Force found there were more than 20 Syrian financial\ninstitutions with operations in Islamic State territory. In\nIraq, Treasury has worked with government officials to cut off\nbank branches in the group\'s territory from the Iraqi and\ninternational financial systems. Gerald Roberts, section chief of the FBI\'s terrorist\nfinancing operations section, said that Islamic State\'s recruits\nfrom outside Syria often come with financial trails that\nofficials tracking them can "exploit." "We are seeing them using traditional banking systems," he\nsaid at a banking conference last week in Washington, adding\nthat young, tech-savvy Islamic State members are also familiar\nwith virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Islamic State, also known as IS, ISIS or ISIL, is sometimes\nforced to use commercial banks because the amounts involved are\ntoo large to move using other means, said Levitt. The U.S. Treasury\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(FinCEN) uses a set of "business rules" to screen the roughly\n55,000 reports it receives daily from financial institutions for\nsigns of activity involving Islamic State, a spokesman said. He\ndeclined to describe the rules, but law enforcement sources say\nnames, IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers are\namong the data that intelligence authorities try to match. The matches allow FinCEN "to connect the dots between\nseemingly unrelated individuals and entities," the FinCEN\nspokesman said. At present, FinCEN finds about 1,200 matches\nsuggesting possible Islamic State-linked financial activity each\nmonth, up from 800 in April, the spokesman said. Bank of America, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo\n declined to comment on whether they provided financial\nreports to the U.S. government. Such reports are supplied\nconfidentially. Citigroup, HSBC, and Standard Chartered\n did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  "TIDAL WAVE II" The use of financial records linked to Islamic State is only\none part of the intelligence-gathering exercise for air strikes\nin Syria that also includes methods such as aerial surveillance\nby drones, officials said. One former military official familiar with the process said\nthat any financial intelligence collected by FinCEN would\nrequire "significant vetting" before the military acted on it. Earlier this month, U.S.-led coalition planes struck 116\nfuel trucks used to smuggle Islamic State oil 45 minutes after\ndropping leaflets warning drivers to flee, a Pentagon spokesman\nsaid. Coalition strikes destroyed another 283 Islamic State fuel\ntrucks on Saturday, the Pentagon said. On Nov. 8, a coalition air strike destroyed three oil\nrefineries in Syria near the border with Turkey. U.S. defense officials estimate that Islamic State, an\nadversary the United States calls the wealthiest terrorist group\nof its kind in history, was earning about $47 million per month\nfrom oil sales prior to October. That month, the U.S. military launched an intensified effort\nto go after oil infrastructure, dubbed "Tidal Wave II," named\nafter the bombing campaign targeting Romanian oil fields in\nWorld War Two. The Pentagon estimates the strikes have reduced the Islamic\nState\'s income from oil sales by about 30 percent, one U.S.\ndefense official with knowledge of the previously unreported\nestimate said. Reuters was unable to confirm this. The use of financial records in helping to pick U.S. targets\nwas first disclosed last week at the banking conference in\nWashington. At the conference, Kurt Gredzinski, the Counter\nThreat Finance Team Chief at U.S. Special Operations Command,\ncited the importance of information provided by banks in the war\nagainst Islamic State. "That to me is the first time in my recollection that we\nstrategically targeted based on threat finance information," he\nsaid at the conference. He declined to comment further on which\nstrike he had been referring to.  "RESILIENT FINANCIAL PORTFOLIO" U.S. officials believe that diminished funding could\ngradually undermine Islamic State\'s grip on the area it controls\nin Iraq and Syria, because it needs revenue to pay salaries and\nkeep public infrastructure operating, said two former officials\nwith knowledge of the Obama administration\'s thinking. Experts caution that Islamic State, which rules an area the\nsize of Austria, has surprisingly deep pockets due to the\nvarious revenue streams it controls. It has built up what\namounts to a "durable and resilient financial portfolio," funded\nby oil sales, extortion, and sales of antiquities, said Thomas\nSanderson, an expert on terrorism at the Center for Strategic\nand International Studies. "Money can be strapped to the backs of mules," Sanderson\nsaid. "It\'s easy to move things across a border during a time of\ndeprivation and chaos." Despite some initial success, cutting off its funding will\nrequire deeper cooperation from governments from Turkey to\nRussia, experts say. The group has shown the ability to bounce\nback from previous U.S. strikes on its oil facilities. Counter-terrorism experts say that Islamic State appears to\nhave learned from U.S. successes in cracking down on funding for\nal-Qaeda, which relied heavily on support from wealthy donors in\nthe Gulf region. "IS has learned that you don\'t want to be reliant on too\nmany outside sources," said Sanderson. "Donors are fickle and\nsubject to pressure and (IS) wants to be in control."\n\n (Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati in Washington and Brett Wolf of\nThomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

After more formal follow-up meetings, the Spanish bank made its first foray into Israel, investing an undisclosed sum in MyCheck, which develops customized mobile payment apps for restaurant chains such as The Cheesecake Factory. With many clients in the hospitality sector, Santander was intrigued by the possibility of providing "a new and better solution for our clients," Belinky told Reuters at a financial technology (fintech) event hosted by Santander in Tel Aviv last month.      He now expects Santander InnoVentures, which has $100 million to invest over two years, to make one or two investments in Israel annually, the only market it invests in without also having a banking operation. For years, Israel tried to entice foreign banks to come and compete with domestic operators, with little success. Now, foreigners are finally coming, but not to open up bank branches. It\'s Israel\'s skills in the flourishing space where technology and finance meet that is drawing them in. Major banks such as Citi, Barclays and Santander have all set up hubs and are investing in or mentoring start-ups in the burgeoning fintech sector. The smartest technologies are likely to be implemented at their banks. Originally fintech applied to technologies that helped financial institutions conduct transactions faster and more cheaply. Today, fintech ranges from risk management and data security to mobile banking and alternative currencies. Globally, investment in the sector tripled to $12 billion in 2014, according to Accenture.  With expertise in security, mobile communications and big data analysis crafted in military intelligence units, Israel is helping\xa0financial groups to serve customers better. "There\'s a very strong innovation culture here which is clearly exciting," Belinky said, noting Santander InnoVentures also invested in three U.S. start-ups and one in Sweden. MyCheck Chief Financial Officer Itai Nebenzhal said Santander was expected to implement MyCheck\'s technology for its customers in 2016.  CITI MOBILE APP  Citi, which has invested tens of millions of dollars in its Tel Aviv tech hub and has received a five-year government grant of $25 million, is already deploying Israeli technology. Citi\'s Tel Aviv lab developed the mobile app for "Citi Velocity", one of the largest trading and research platforms for institutional investors, with daily volume exceeding $3 billion. The app is the only one providing market research and trading capabilities under one roof for foreign exchange, Citi said, adding other businesses such as equities, interest rates and commodities are looking to incorporate the app. The Tel Aviv lab, which works with tech teams in London and New York and employs 140 people, focuses on mobile and big data R&D, said Neil Corney, Citi Israel\'s chief country officer. According to the Israel Venture Capital Research Centre, in 2014 there were 379 companies and 14 foreign R&D centers working on financial technology in Israel. Fintech start-ups raised $369 million in 2014, up from $13 million in 2009. While data from 2015 is not available, there was a significant increase this year, said Yoav Caspi, a partner in the AYR law firm who handles many fintech clients.  RISING M&A  Six companies were sold in 2014 for a total of $695 million, the largest being the sale of mobile paying app Check to Intuit Inc for $360 million. This number is set to soar in 2015 with one deal alone -- the acquisition of payment services provider Fundtech by Canada\'s D+H -- valued at $1.25 billion. Outdated regulations in Israel, high costs for developing an initial product and lack of knowledge regarding the needs of financial institutions made it difficult in the past for Israeli start-ups to stand out, Caspi said. But as fintech start-ups began targeting enterprises and end-users, rather than just banks, more Israeli entrepreneurs began to find the sector attractive, he said. Barclays, the first foreign bank to open a lab under the auspices of a Finance Ministry program to encourage financial institutions to invest in fintech, is establishing a scheme to mentor 10 Israeli start-ups at a time, similar to programs it has in London, New York and Cape Town. In Israel, the bank will focus on cyber security, blockchain -- the technology underlying digital currency Bitcoin -- and compliance solutions, said Michal Beinisch, chief operating officer of Barclays Israel. Barclays believes adopting technologies from start-ups will help it compete with advanced financial technologies including mobile payment and digital wallet services. "We realized what all the banks are realizing - unless we go with open innovation rather than internally developed solutions the way banks previously did, banks will lose out to the technology companies," she said.
