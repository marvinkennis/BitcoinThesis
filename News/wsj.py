Back in December, everybody assumed the Fed would be raising interest rates four times in 2016, and that Donald Trump\u2018s odds of capturing the GOP nomination were very low. Four months later, both those assumptions have been turned on their ear. Then we turned our attention to the latest oddball news out of the bitcoin world: another Satoshi Nakamoto sighting. This time it was an Australian businessman named Craig Wright, who claimed he was the digital currency\u2019s mysterious creator. Yet, four days after making his claim, he simply gave up and disappeared, leaving the industry to wonder exactly what happened, and what does it mean for the space.

Since its inception several years ago, bitcoin has seen wild prices swings as advocates have tried to establish the nascent technology as a widely-used digital currency. But for the past three weeks, the price volatility of bitcoin has remained below or equal to that of safe-haven gold, according to data analysis from FactSet and CoinDesk. The last 24 days mark the longest period in which bitcoin prices have been less volatile than gold prices, going back to 2010. Some point to the drop as a sign that investor perception of bitcoin is drawing closer to gold as a safe store of value. Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who covers e-commerce and payments, said that as bitcoin has gathered steam, it\u2019s taken on a similar role to gold. Holding bitcoin or gold can appeal to a coinciding demographic of investors, since both may be used as an alternative when investors lose faith in traditional asset classes. \u201cIt has a lot to do with the perception of value,\u201d Mr. Luria said. \u201cGold used to be the only refuge for those who have grave concerns over the global economy and monetary system.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s volatility also dipped below gold\u2019s for several days in 2012. But the most recent streak carries more weight as activity has grown substantially, Mr. Luria said. According to Wedbush Securities data, monthly bitcoin transactions increased from 200,000 in January 2012 to more than 6 million in March this year. \u201cThere are a lot more forces in balance now,\u201d he said. Others say the calm may be fleeting. The amount of money in the bitcoin industry, estimated at $6.6 billion by Blockchain, is still dwarfed by the money held in gold investments. According to the World Gold Council, the over-the-counter gold market trades between $180 and $250 billion a day. Given the relative size of the bitcoin market, some attribute the low volatility to a move to the sidelines, as investors await more information on the broader economy, as well as the future of the digital currency. \u201cThere\u2019s generally a holding pattern right now,\u201d said Ishan Singh, director of analytics at TradeBlock, which provides trading tools for bitcoin and other blockchain assets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some solid volumes to start the year. Even though volatility has been low, people are still interested in trading.\u201d Still, bitcoin has struggled with regulatory hurdles and security concerns among the broader investing community. Even more stable prices may not be enough to convince institutional investors to pour their money into digital wealth. It could take a long time before most investors are comfortable with bitcoin as a store of wealth, given its speculative nature, said Phillip Kingston, managing director at financial technology-investing firm Trimantium Capital. \u201cBitcoin seems to be stable enough now to be investable to people,\u201d Mr. Kingston said. \u201cBut the big difference now is the risk. [When compared to gold], I just don\u2019t think normal investors see the risk as being equivalent.\u201d UPDATE: A previous version of this post misspelled\xa0Gil\xa0Luria\u2019s name.

Microsoft formed a partnership with a New York-based startup called R3 CEV, which is leading a group of more than 40 banks that includes Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup, Bank of America Corp., and Morgan Stanley. Through the agreement, the banks will have open access to Azure, a cloud-based service for businesses, as well as dedicated staff and resources from Microsoft. It\u2019s another step deeper into the world of blockchain technology for Microsoft. Underscoring its importance to the company, the partnership is being unveiled on Monday as part of a keynote speech by CEO Satya Nadella at the company\u2019s Envision conference in New Orleans. R3 is a private startup, founded in 2013 and majority owned by banking veteran David Rutter, that established the blockchain-banking consortium in September with nine banks. It has since expanded that group to more than 40 banks around the world. The consortium\u2019s goal is to test and build products that utilize the blockchain. That could be new trading and settlement platforms, or issuing financing and securities. Microsoft is not taking an equity stake in R3. Financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed, but it will operate as any other client/vendor relationship Microsoft has on Azure. Under the agreement, Microsoft will offer its services and staff to the R3 group, operating as a \u201cpreferred\u201d but not exclusive vendor. The goal is to speed up the time it takes to build and release products that have the blockchain underpinning them, Mr. Rutter said. His broad expectation is that this year will be about getting a better understanding of the technology. It might take a year to 18 months before some commercial products are developed, and maybe 3 to 5 years before they are released. Nobody knows exactly how it will all pan out, of course, but there is now a broad swath of financial and technology firms vying to capitalize on this technology. The partnership is the latest foray for Microsoft into the fast-moving world of blockchains, and it illustrates how lines are being drawn among competitors and industries, and also how soft those lines are. The race to build blockchain-based products and services in the financial industry has become an odd mix of competition and cooperation. R3\u2019s consortium involves more than three dozen banks that usually are in competition with each other. There is another consortium, the Hyperledger project, looking to build standards and platforms for blockchain-based products and services. That group includes International Business Machines, Intel, J.P. Morgan, CME Group, DTCC, as well as startups Digital Asset Holdings \u2013 and R3. Another startup, Digital Asset Holdings, is working on projects with DTCC and the ASX Ltd., Australia\u2019s main stock exchange operator, and counts among its investors J.P. Morgan. \u201cThere is plenty for everybody,\u201d said Mr. Rutter. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge market.\u201d Through this new partnership, Microsoft will be providing Azure\u2019s online services, as well as dedicated tech support, project managers, and lab assistance at the technology centers it has in a number of cities, including New York, Milan, Beijing, and Sao Paulo. The fact that banks in the consortium can have physical places to meet and work on projects was \u201cvery important\u201d to R3, Mr. Rutter said. The company explored using other platforms, including from IBM\xa0and Amazon.com before approaching Microsoft. The goal for Microsoft, said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development, is not just to experiment, but to become a central player in this industry. \u201cWe\u2019d like to be the cloud infrastructure under all of them,\u201d she said. In addition to this partnership, the company will continue to explore other ways to be involved in the space. Azure previously began integrating Ethereum, a separate blockchain-based platform, into its offerings. Microsoft first started experimenting in 2014, when it started accepting bitcoin in its online stores. Microsoft is also looking at ways to incorporate this technology into its own products and services. The company announced last week that it was building support for an Ethereum programming language called Solidity into its Visual Studio. \u201cWe\u2019re all in,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/04/04/microsoft-signs-r3-blockchain-consortium-up-for-azure/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 4, 4, 10, 55), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure Partners With R3 Blockchain Consortium'}, {'articleText': u' The blockchain isn\u2019t going to eat the banks quite yet. That\u2019s more or less the conclusion of a 48-page paper this week from Citigroup researchers, written by Keith Horowitz along with Adrien Porter and Michael Cronin. The paper, one of a series this group has produced, is concerned mainly with the use of blockchain-based systems within the cross-border and trade finance areas of international banking; they wrote a separate paper in January that looked at\xa0blockchain and securities settlement, and plan another paper on the remittance business. Blockchain is the catch-all name for the technology that underlies the digital currency bitcoin. It is a platform that\u2019s maintained by a network of decentralized computers, rather than with a centralized group of servers. At its heart, the blockchain is an open ledger in which every transaction on the network is recorded and available for all participants to see and verify. Since bitcoin broke into mainstream consciousness, the underlying technology has become a major topic of interest on Wall Street and in financial circles in general. Citigroup, as well as most other big banks, has been investigating the technology to see what makes it tick, and to what degree it may disrupt the banking sector and to what degree it can be co-opted by the banks themselves. Citi is part of a consortium of more than 40 banks working with the firm R3 to build blockchain-based platforms. The bank has also tested the technology on its own, building its own currency, dubbed Citicoin, in an internal test. \u201cWe don\u2019t view blockchain as an intermediate-term strategic threat to the profitable high-value cross-border payments business for the banks,\u201d Mr. Horowitz wrote. The main reason for this, he argues, is the reason that has given birth to the entire cross-border payments infrastructure in the first place: the lack of a true international currency. \u201cLarge international banks are needed to transfer value across borders since currencies can only travel physically within their respective central bank system.\u201d Blockchain technology can help build a new set of rails for this payment network, he says, but to really reach some kind of material scale, it will need a true international, digital currency at its heart. Bitcoin currently can\u2019t scale up to the size that would necessary, he thinks, and he doesn\u2019t see any other candidates on the horizon. \u201cCentral banks are likely not willing to cede control of the money supply.\u201d   The key phrase here is \u201cintermediate term.\u201d It\u2019s true that bitcoin as currency constructed is too size-constrained to serve this global business. Commercial banks, however, aren\u2019t the only ones interested in this field. Regulators and central banks are also interested, and it\u2019s quite possible one of them could produce a digitized currency that would fill the void Citi identifies, which is probably why Mr. Horowitz referenced the intermediate term. What if the People\u2019s Bank of China, which would love to dethrone the dollar, digitized the yuan? What if the Bank of England digitized the pound? Both are asking questions about the prospects. Here\u2019s a translated page from the PBOC\xa0about a conference it convened on the matter. Here\u2019s a speech from the Bank of England\u2019s Ben Broadbent that explores the possibility. No central bank is going to move with Silicon-Valley speed into this field, but they\u2019re thinking philosophically about it and trying to tease out all the issues. Mr. Horowitz sees more immediate promise for blockchains in the trade finance world, specifically as a way to replace the letters of credits used to finance a good chunk of international trade (about 20%). \u201cLetter of credit is a manually intensive process, making it ripe for digitization,\u201d he said. A typical transaction can comprise 150 different records and up to 10 different parties to the transaction signing off on it. Moreover, about 80% of these transactions, he said, end up with some manner of discrepancy that delays the transaction. Ostensibly, a type of smart contract could be built that would record a transaction\u2019s particulars, codify it through the blockchain, and release the funds only after certain conditions are met. \u201cWe believe blockchain can help tackle the main challenge of trade today, which is just taking the paper-based process and digitizing it, while adding features such as smart contracts that would trigger actions such as payment release and/or shipment of goods,\u201d Mr. Horowitz wrote.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/03/30/blockchains-primetime-still-a-ways-off-citi-says/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2016, 3, 30, 13, 30), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Blockchain&rsquo;s Primetime Still A Ways Off, Citi Says'}, {'articleText': u' The rift in the Bitcoin community\xa0over an arcane line of coding remains as wide as ever despite several concerted efforts to close it, and time may be running out to stave off an existential crisis. For almost a year now, the bitcoin industry has been starkly divided over the question of how to expand the digital currency\u2019s network, and the fight has morphed from a technical issue to a raging political debate that shows no signs of abating, broadly pitting entrepreneurs who have built businesses around bitcoin against the \u201cminers\u201d who maintain the network, with developers split among the two groups. \u201cI liken it to when religions split off,\u201d said Bobby Lee, the chief executive\xa0of Chinese exchange BTCC. The two camps even have names now, Core and Classic. Core is the more conservative group, mainly miners, which wants to move slowly, if they move at all. Classic is the more business-oriented group, which wants a workable, real-world fix now. It sounds almost quixotic, this small community involved in this big fight. But there are $6.4 billion worth of bitcoin out there, and more than $1 billion of venture-capital\xa0money invested. People have dedicated their lives to it. If this row isn\u2019t resolved, all of that could get washed down the drain. Bitcoin, the digital currency launched in 2009, can be thought of as an intricate machine, designed to run essentially without any oversight. In order to remain operating without any hand on the tiller, it has a built-in incentive. Participants contribute computing power to the decentralized network, these are the so-called miners, doing the key job of confirming transactions on the network, which are packaged into batches called blocks. In exchange for this service, they get a reward: 25 newly minted bitcoins, paid out roughly every ten minutes to whichever miner is first to process the block.\xa0Once confirmed, they are entered into bitcoin\u2019s open ledger, called the blockchain, an unalterable historical record. As the network has grown, a problem has arisen. The blocks have a 1 megabyte size limit, a cap installed by the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2010. What\u2019s happening now is that the network has grown to a point where transactions are completely filling the blocks, with some transactions being forced to wait for several minutes, or in some cases longer, for the next block to be confirmed. Resolving this issue is much thornier than it sounds. Technically, you just increase the size limit on blocks. Doing that, however, completely alters the profitability of the miners, who have evolved from individuals with desktops to enterprise-level operations with massive server farms.\xa0Larger block sizes alters the economics of mining, possibly giving an advantage to larger miners, leaving smaller miners with lower odds of capturing the 25-bitcoin prize. That could mean fewer miners overall, and a concentration of computing power in a smaller number of hands\xa0could lead to effective control over the network. For a movement founded on principles of decentralization, this is absolutely unacceptable. Not increasing the size, though, makes the network run more slowly than it could, and makes it potentially less attractive to users. That could affect the business model of all the start-ups in the industry. This has led to a complete impasse, and a fight that has only gotten nastier and more intractable over the months. The whole thing illustrates just how hard it is to build an open, decentralized network that isn\u2019t the province of any one group, and may be an object lesson for the myriad projects being built around the currency\u2019s underlying technology. So far, there have been intermittent reports of transaction delays. In general, a large number of blocks have been bumping right up against the 1 megabyte\xa0limit. Some companies have reported some customers complaints, but there hasn\u2019t been a breakdown in the network. The price of bitcoin, too, remains so far unaffected. The price has traded mainly above $400 in 2016, most recently around $415.   A late-Feburary meeting in Florida, the so-called Satoshi Roundtable, brought together all the important players in this drama, with the pressing goal of coming to some kind of compromise. The meeting ended without any such accord, as the two sides dug in even more than expected. After the meeting, in fact, several prominent players, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Blockchain.info CEO Peter Smith, and lead developer Gavin Andresen, publicly criticized the gathering. The bitcoin core developers, Mr. Armstrong\xa0wrote on Medium, \u201cview themselves as the central planners of the network, and protectors of the people. They seem okay with watching bitcoin fail, as long as they don\u2019t compromise on their principles.\u201d One participant at the meeting who asked not to be identified felt that after its failure, and after the failure of a series of attempts to bridge the gap, it\u2019s becoming increasingly unlikely that a solution will be found. \u201cI think at this point,\u201d the person said, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of room left [for compromise].\u201d The debate is going to run into a large wildcard\xa0in three months\u2019 time, one that could possibly spark a real meltdown in bitcoin\u2019s intricate machine: an event that occurs every four years called \u201cthe halving.\u201d In order to maintain bitcoin\u2019s self-imposed cap of producing only 21 million bitcoins \u2013 a measure designed to prevent inflation from creeping into the currency \u2013 the mining reward is halved every four years. This deadline arrives in June, meaning the 25 bitcoins that miners currently receive is going to be cut down to 12.5 bitcoins. Even if the block-size fight wasn\u2019t happening, this halving event is going to affect the industry, quite simply making mining an unprofitable business for some. This was not an unexpected event, and indeed the laws of supply and demand should rush in to fill any gaps. The fear, though, is that if the block-size impasse is not solved by then, you may end up with a situation where an already sluggish network that isn\u2019t processing transactions quickly could be hit with a significant loss of computing power. The combination could effectively shut down the network. That\u2019s the worst-case scenario. Nobody knows exactly what will happen. BTCC\u2019s Mr. Lee is still confident that the whole thing will be resolved. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit around and watch the thing implode,\u201d he said.

That may well be, but another small step was taken just before this year closes out, as the first securities transaction to be processed and settled on Nasdaq new blockchain-based platform, called Linq, occurred on Wednesday, the exchange operator said. Linq was built earlier this year, part of Nasdaq\u2019s forays into exploring blockchain technology. It\u2019s designed as a platform for private companies to issue debt and securities. This first transaction involved the startup Chain, which issued equity to a U.S. investor via the platform. The specific terms weren\u2019t disclosed. Nasdaq was part of a consortium, which included Visa, Citi Ventures, and Capital One Financial, that in September invested $30 million in Chain. The technology underlying the digital currency bitcoin, popularly called \u201cthe blockchain,\u201d has become a source of intense interest on Wall Street. If offers the promise of taking the entire process of creating, issuing, and trading assets of all kinds and digitizing it. Rather than a settlement times of days,\xa0the whole thing happens in a matter of minutes, a development that could eliminate counterparty risks and free up massive amounts of capital that are tied up waiting for transactions to be finished. Blockchain technology could cut $20 billion in annual costs out of the global banking system, a Santander InnoVentures report earlier this year estimated. All of this, however, is largely theoretical. Until the system is used in the real world, and proves its worth and value, banks and financial firms aren\u2019t going to just move their entire operations over. That\u2019s why this first live test of the system matters. The equity issued by Chain on Linq was no different than equity issued via any other medium, Chain CEO Adam Ludwin told MoneyBeat. All the same terms and language are embedded in the digitized security, he said, as it would be for any other security. Lawyers for all parties involved, the investor, Chain, and Nasdaq, were involved and signed off on it. The difference is that issuing the equity took minutes (the transaction itself settled in seconds), rather than days. Chain\u2019s capitalization table, a firm\u2019s record of its ownership, is now on Linq, Mr. Ludwin pointed out. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an Excel spreadsheet managing our cap table,\u201d he said. \u201cThe official record is now on Nasdaq\u2019s blockchain network.\u201d The platform is live, but will be rolled out slowly.

Josh Garza, through two firms he owned, GAW Miner and Zen Miner, sold $20 million worth of \u201cmining contracts\u201d between August and December 2014, the SEC alleged, to more than 10,000 investors. The contracts were supposed to be a way for investors to collect new bitcoins\u2014a process which involves immense computing power\u2014without themselves investing in expensive equipment. Purportedly, investors were also shielding themselves from bitcoin\u2019s volatility, as the contracts were guaranteed to provide a steady stream of income. \u201cGarza and his companies cloaked their scheme in technological sophistication and jargon,\u201d the SEC said in a press release, \u201cbut the fraud was simple at its core: they sold what they did not own, misrepresented what they were selling, and robbed one investor to pay another.\u201d Efforts to reach Mr. Garza for comment were initially unsuccessful. The SEC is seeking \u201cpermanent injunctive relief,\u201d the return of any ill-gotten gains, and a fine on top of that, according to the complaint. Mr. Garza and his firm purportedly guaranteed customers a steady payout from the company\u2019s mining operations. But GAW Miner never owned enough computing power to pay out the contracts it was signing, the SEC alleged, meaning \u201cmost investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed.\u201d Most investors\xa0\u201cnever recovered the full amount of their investments, and few made a profit,\u201d\xa0the SEC said. Almost from the start, GAW Miner was a lightning rod for controversy. Mr. Garza was a much-discussed topic in the bitcoin community, and there were public complaints against him almost from the beginning. The SEC wouldn\u2019t say when it began investigating GAW Miner, but by July, it had served Mr. Garza\u2019s brother, Carlos Garza, with a subpoena, according to the agency. Carlos also worked at GAW Miner and the SEC wanted to speak with\xa0him\xa0as part of the investigation. He showed up at the SEC\u2019s Boston office in August, but refused to answer any questions. After that, the agency sought and received a court order compelling him to testify. The company has been the subject of a number of lawsuits from disgruntled customers. In August, a Mississippi court ruled against the company, ordering it to pay $346,600 to a state utility, Mississippi Power Company, for months\u2019 worth of unpaid electricity bills.

After launching the mining contracts, Mr. Garza had another seemingly bold idea for the market: paycoin, a bitcoin alternative that supposedly had several features that made it a superior alternative. He launched the coin on Dec. 12 amid a fair amount of hype. But it immediately fizzled, and has steadily lost value since its launch. Paycoin is still trading, though at a fraction of its launch price. It most recently was quoted at $0.02, and the 16 million coins distributed have a total market cap of about $320,000.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $374.81, up 0.4% (via CoinDesk) - BitPesa, the two-year old Kenyan startup that offers money-transfer services over the bitcoin network, has expanded into Nigeria and Uganda, marking the third and fourth countries in which it operates. It started operating in Tanzania in the spring. BitPesa is an interesting firm to follow. There\u2019s been a lot of interest in bringing bitcoin into the emerging markets, and tapping the billions of people who are considered \u201cunbanked.\u201d But actually building a sustainable business is harder than it seems. There have been myriad bitcoin startups trying to crack this market around the world over the past two years. Some, like 37coins, which shut down this summer, have found building a money-transfer business harder than expected. Entering Nigeria puts BitPesa into the continent\u2019s largest economy. At $568.5 billion, Nigeria is nearly ten times the size of Kenya\u2019s $65 billion economy. And while it has its share of problems\xa0like many frontier markets,\xa0and its own share of the unbanked, it also has tens of millions of people who live in cities and have access to banking services, and build businesses like in any other nation. It is that market, the business sector, where BitPesa is finding its growth.\xa0BitPesa began as a service aimed at consumers, but it\u2019s growing as a service for business. \u201cNearly all (at least two-thirds) of our customers are using BitPesa for business needs,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Elizabeth Rossiello via email, \u201csuch as salaries, suppliers or operations. There are very few people transacting for basic livelihood needs, such as food or rent.\u201d This is where the company is focusing its efforts now. BitPesa\u2019s\xa0service was first aimed at a single corridor of the remittance business: Kenyans living abroad in the U.K. It has built up its customer base by going into the diaspora community and building ties. The company is seeing double-digit sales growth this year, Ms. Rossiello said. The growth is coming from new directions, though. What BitPesa is finding is that there\u2019s demand for its service among businesses, especially businesses working for foreign suppliers that need to move money across borders. The firm, which has operations in the U.K. as well, applied for and received a license from the U.K.\u2019s\xa0Financial Conduct Authority to become a payments services institution, meaning it operates under the same rules as traditional money remitters and nonbank credit-card issuers. The firm has raised $2.7 million in total funding, including $1.1 million earlier this year from a group that included Pantera Capital. It was founded in 2013 by Ms. Rossiello and Duncan Goldie-Scot, a well-known veteran of the microfinance sector. UPDATE: BitPesa has raised $2.7 million to date. An earlier version of this post incorrectly said it was $1.7 million.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $411.42, up 0.7% (via CoinDesk) Bitcoin has gone from a bear market to a bull market to a bear market again \u2013 this week. Bitcoin\u2019s price spent much of this year treading water, trading between $200 and $250. Since the start of this week,\xa0it\u2019s gone parabolic again. It jumped from around $318 on Monday to $492 on Wednesday afternoon \u2013 a 54% surge. It fell back under $400 this morning, a drop of about 20%. It\u2019s back over $400 in the afternoon. Those aren\u2019t normal moves, but of course, bitcoin isn\u2019t a normal market. Having just celebrated its seventh birthday (Satoshi Nakamoto released his white paper on Oct. 31, 2008), bitcoin has grown from obscurity to notoriety to something resembling normalcy. But bitcoin is still more experiment than platform, and that is even truer for all the so-called bitcoin 2.0 projects floating around. Trying to figure out if bitcoin can move from experiment to mainstream, trying to figure out what bitcoin is going to be when it grows up, makes valuing it tricky. To be sure, the bitcoin 2.0 hype is driving a good part of this latest speculative boom. From American Express to WestPac, big banks are taking this technology seriously, and putting money and manpower behind it. Over the next 24 months, the top 100 financial companies around the world will invest $1 billion in blockchain-related projects, according to a report from M&A advisory firm Magister Advisors (the same report got a lot of press by predicting that bitcoin would be the world\u2019s sixth largest reserve currency by 2030). Can they recreate the wheel, so to speak? To the bitcoin stalwarts, all this attention on blockchain misses the point. \u201cThe focus should be on the creation of an independent bitcoin capital market separated from the control of banks,\u201d said First Global Credit CEO Gavin Smith. \u201cAfter the facilities are in place for a bitcoin capital market, let the banking industry join the free trade network that has been established.\u201d Can that kind of a market be established if bitcoin trades like a bucking bronco? To the extent that the renewed volatility reminds people of the 2013 Wild West days, it could hinder wider adoption. There\u2019s a reason why Wall Street resisted \u201cbitcoin,\u201d but has been very open to \u201cblockchain.\u201d To the extent that it makes using the currency harder because you can\u2019t be sure of the fiat value of your bitcoin holdings or what you\u2019re going to get back in a transaction, it hurts adoption. It hasn\u2019t been so bad for some investors, though, not this week. The price of Bitcoin Investment Trust ETF was trading around $30 from May to late October, virtually immobile. It\u2019s up about 50% since the end of October, even if it is down 11% on Thursday. Indeed, if you\u2019re a pure trader, the volatility is great. Bitcoin as a trading platform is a free-marketer\u2019s dream: there are no opening or closing bells, there are multiple exchanges that open up arbitrage plays, there are options and derivatives to aid betting for or against the currency. There are no circuit breakers. In China, where much of the trading is speculative to begin with, the volatility only fuels more trading. Like so much with bitcoin, whether the volatility is good or bad comes down to what you want bitcoin to be, and that is a question that is still being answered, and may not be answered for many years. That is what makes determining bitcoin\u2019s \u201cfundamental\u201d value so hard.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $413.20; up 15% (via CoinDesk) The price of bitcoin is surging, crossing back over the $400 mark for the first time since last November, amid a burst of trading activity and a surge in interest in the technology underlying the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin crossed back over $400 on Tuesday (and well over it on most exchanges), up 15% over the past 24 hours and capping a run that has seen it nearly double since falling to $209 back in August. It\u2019s been nearly a year since the price was at the $400 level, last November. Back then, it was on its way down, a drawn-out, year-long slide from the late 2013 all-time high above $1,100. Today, the price is on its way up. There isn\u2019t one explanation for the move, but one thing is clear: The bitcoin hype machine is back in action \u2013 even if it\u2019s been redirected. The news around the cryptocurrency world has been pretty bright lately. Even if bitcoin still has a stigma in the public eye, the hype around the potential of bitcoin\u2019s underlying mechanics \u2013 the so-called blockchain \u2013 has positively exploded. Former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. executive Blythe Masters, now running the fintech startup Digital Asset Holdings,\xa0graced the cover of Bloomberg Markets magazine, in an article titled \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Blockchain.\u201d The cover story of this week\u2019s Economist, \u201cThe Next Big Thing,\u201d is also about the potential of the blockchain. Microsoft is putting Ethereum-based blockchain tools into its Azure business service. It seems as if every bank on Wall Street and in the City is setting up some kind of group to probe and experiment. It\u2019s as if the shift in focus to the blockchain\xa0has completely changed people\u2019s opinions about the technology. \u201cThe idea is now at the forefront of every financial institution, every corporation, every media outlet,\u201d said Bobby Cho, director of trading at New York-based exchange ItBit. \u201cEven if you\u2019re reading about blockchain technology, you\u2019re inherently reading about bitcoin also.\u201d The interest is driving up the trading activity, and the increased activity is spurring interest from institutional traders who\u2019ve been sitting on the sidelines, waiting for bitcoin\u2019s market to perk up again. \u201cNow the volatility is back,\u201d Mr. Cho said, \u201cand they\u2019re thinking, \u2018we can make some money here.\u2019 These guys are looking for a product to trade.\u201d It is clear that volume is rising. In early September, trading on BTCC, the biggest bitcoin exchange, was averaging around 20,000 bitcoins a day. Lately it\u2019s been closer to 80,000 bitcoins, and CEO Bobby Lee told MoneyBeat that on Tuesday, it was near to the exchange\u2019s one-day record of 90,000. Bitcoin is still a relatively thin market, so the added volume alone can explain part of the surge. Any buying spree will be amplified by the scarcity of bitcoins, something that helped explain the 2013 surge to the all-time high of $1,100. Some have surmised that the new capital controls imposed in China\xa0are spurring nationals there to use bitcoin as a way to evade the controls, but Mr. Lee rejects that. There are better ways to evade capital controls, he said. China has an extensive black-market currency exchange system that\u2019s very similar to the hawala system used in the Muslim world (we explained this at some length in \u201cThe Age of Cryptocurrency\u201d) and effectively evades the stringent capital controls. Additionally, the price of bitcoin when converted from U.S. dollars to yuan winds up about $10-15 higher. This reflects, Mr. Lee said, the fact that given the price controls, it\u2019s actually harder to buy bitcoins there. So the arbitrage opportunity is to buy bitcoin in dollars, and exchange them into yuan. That makes it less likely that traders are moving their yuan out via bitcoin. In China, the trading is all speculative, Mr. Lee said, and right now all that positive press has the speculators driving up the price. \u201cPeople in China are always trigger happy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a bear market for a year and a half.\u201d The blockchain is the new \u201cshining star, and it spills over to the bitcoin world as well.\u201d Email: paul.vigna@wsj.com; Twitter: @paulvigna For more insight into stocks and bonds, deals and dealmakers, the economy and business, be sure to\xa0subscribe to the MoneyBeat podcast.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/11/03/bitbeat-bitcoin-surges-past-400-on-back-of-the-new-shining-star/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 11, 3, 13, 56), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: Bitcoin Surges Past $400 on Back of the New &lsquo;Shining Star&rsquo;'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, the latest in cryptocurrency news and analysis. Bitcoin Latest Price: $298.65, up 1.4% (via CoinDesk) Microsoft was one of the first big companies to step into the bitcoin world. Now, it is taking a step into the Bitcoin 2.0 world. The software giant has formed a partnership with Brooklyn-based Consensys, a startup that is building products and services for Ethereum, an alternative platform to bitcoin. Through the partnership, customers of Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based business service, will have access to tools that will allow them to experiment with and build products that can digitize and automate a plethora of operations, from securities trading to cross-border payments to corporate accounting, and offer them to their own customers. There is \u201ctremendous hunger\u201d for these kinds of \u201cblockchain\u201d tools among the company\u2019s customers, said Marley Gray, \xa0the director of tech strategy for financial services at Microsoft\u2019s Times Square-based technology center, and the company was attracted to Ethereum by its flexibility. Vitalik Buterin, a 21-year old programmer and writer, launched Ethereum this summer as a platform for what are called smart contracts. While bitcoin was designed with the single purpose of exchanging digital currency, Ethereum has broader goals.\xa0Ethereum\u2019s mandate is to provide businesses with a platform on which products and services can be built that simplify various business functions and cut out the need for third parties. Anything that can be digitized, cryptocurrencies, derivatives trading, securities trading and settlement, even property titles, is a potential service on Ethereum. Interest in these kinds of blockchain-based services is growing rapidly on Wall Street, which increasingly sees\xa0it as a way to streamline operations and potentially cut billions in costs from back-office operations. Firms like Symbiont, ItBit, and Overstock.com have built their own smart-contract platforms. A clutch of multinational banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse, and Barclays, joined a consortium formed by the firm R3 CEV, with the aim of establishing standards for blockchain technologies in financial services. Citigroup recently built its own cryptocurrencies, dubbed Citicoins, as a test of their capabilities. Azure clients will have the ability to quickly build products or choose from existing templates to improve operations from accounting to logistics to cross-border payments and settlement. Firms that create products on Azure\u2019s blockchain service can choose whether to release the product to the general public or control who has access to them. Consensys is building and maintaining the service; Microsoft is essentially providing the distribution platform, which in this case is Azure. Consensys isn\u2019t getting any revenue under the partnership, but plans to offer consulting and other high-end services to Azure clients. Andrew Keys, director of communications at Consensys, said he essentially cold-called Microsoft with the idea. He sent an unsolicited email in September to Mr. Gray. To his surprise, Mr. Gray was very interested. Microsoft, which in late 2014 started accepting bitcoin in its XBox store, had blockchain technology \u201con our radar,\u201d Mr. Gray said, and was getting asked about it from customers. The prospect of being able to offer a platform for smart contracts appealed to them, and was the main reason they went with an Ethereum-based product rather than a bitcoin-based one, he said.

The European Union\u2019s Court of Justice ruled that bitcoin exchanges that transfer conventional currencies such as euros or Swedish krona into bitcoin for a fee are exempt from value-added taxes because of EU rules barring\xa0such taxes on transfers of\xa0\u201ccurrency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender.\u201d The ruling is a significant boost for bitcoin\xa0in one of the world\u2019s largest trading areas, removing the threat of taxes that would have raised the cost of buying or using the virtual currency\xa0in Europe.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $276.42, up 3.4% (via CoinDesk) Bitcoin has a reputation as a darling of the dark-web set, a conduit for all manner of illegal activity. A group of civic-minded bitcoiners is trying to change that through a new partnership with law enforcement in the U.S. It might just\xa0help catch bad guys, too. The group is called the Blockchain Alliance, and it was created by Coin Center and the Digital Chamber of Commerce, two bitcoin trade groups based in Washington, D.C. It\u2019s a private-sector initiative, but its goal is to create an open-ended dialogue with the public sector, specifically law enforcement agencies. Bitcoin\u2019s volatile, wild days have receded, but it still carries with it\xa0a notorious reputation as a tool of drug dealers and criminals, a reputation forged by high-profile scandals like the collapse of the early bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and the capture of Ross Ulbricht, the Texas\xa0man convicted in February of running the online drug bazaar called the Silk Road. \u201cThis is an ecosystem that has a lot of companies trying to build businesses on top of the technology,\u201d said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, \u201cand to the extent that it\u2019s associated with crime, that\u2019s no good.\u201d The idea for the alliance grew out of a series of conversations among bitcoin industry leaders earlier this year about the currency\u2019s potential and its obstacles, said Jason Weinstein, a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice and currently a partner at the law firm Steptoe & Johnson who is the alliance\u2019s director. The use of bitcoin by criminals, and the image problems associated with it, were seen as a key problem, and this group was proposed as a solution. Mr. Weinstein\u2019s Washington office will be the contact point for both law enforcement and the bitcoin community, essentially acting as a call center for members. \u201cIt\u2019s really meant to be a very simple, cost-free resource for law enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one-stop shopping for law enforcement to get education and technical assistance on the issues.\u201d A handful of agencies are participating, including\xa0the Department of Justice, the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service, the Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations division, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Bitcoin firms involved include bitcoin companies CoinBase, BitFury, BitPay, Kraken, Blockchain, Xapo, Circle Internet Financial, MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative and developer Gavin Andresen. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d said\xa0Kathryn Haun, an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Department of Justice\u2019s San Francisco office, \u201cthese kinds of alliances exist whether formally or informally in numerous industries. Yes, we have different goals than they do, but sometimes those goals overlap, and that\u2019s not different here with the Blockchain Alliance.\u201d\xa0Her task force has been at the forefront of prosecuting crimes involving digital currencies \u2013 she was the lead prosecutor in the case against the former government agents Carl Force and Sean Bridges, who were convicted of embezzling money from Mr. Ulbricht of Silk Road \u2013 and has already developed relationships with a number of firms. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of [bitcoin] companies don\u2019t want criminal activity on their platforms.\u201d The government has gotten better at understanding bitcoin and the technology behind it, but the government still can learn from industry insiders, said Jason Brown, assistant to the special agent in charge at the cyberintelligence division of the Secret Service\u2019s Investigations Division.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $250.35, up 1.9% (via CoinDesk) - Blockstream, a group comprising some of the best-known cryptocurrency developers, on Tuesday released the first product to come out of its effort to address some of bitcoin\u2019s perceived weaknesses and open it up to so-called \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033 applications, while still maintaining its core ethos of decentralization. This is a group that is philosophically, and financially, wedded to bitcoin and its stated goal of providing a borderless, decentralized, \u201ctrustless\u201d open platform that allows people to exchange value on a peer-to-peer basis, without any banks or governments getting in the middle. It\u2019s an idea that is starting to be lost in the scramble on Wall Street to adopt the technology and bend it to the banks\u2019 own needs. The product is called Liquid, a so-called \u201csidechain,\u201d a platform that operates separately from bitcoin but is ultimately \u201cpegged\u201d back to the digital currency. Liquid is an attempt to create a system that maintains bitcoin\u2019s open system, while sidestepping its built-in limitations. If it works as planned, Liquid will be a sort of hybrid between bitcoin itself and the many projects currently underway that are taking the blockchain technology and building entirely separate products. It\u2019s one more front being opened in the quest to keep bitcoin alive. While the digital currency remains the only use case of the software to reach any critical mass, and the price has stabilized, the underlying technology has itself this year become the focus. From the startup world to the biggest Wall Street firms, there are numerous efforts under way to build products and services that utilize bitcoin\u2019s underlying\xa0technology, while abandoning bitcoin itself. The Blockstream group is an effort to counter that tide. Blockstream formed last year, and the group\xa0described its goals in an initial white paper last October.\xa0The group counts among its founding members Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, Austin Hill, and Pieter Wuille. It raised $21 million in venture capital last November from LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, among others.\xa0The consortium unveiled a prototype of the system in June. Several well-known bitcoin exchanges and services firms, including Kraken, Xapo, Bitfinex, BTCC, and Unocoin, signed on as partners to the Liquid network. \u201cWe\u2019re collaborating to address some key technical and\xa0business challenges while preserving Bitcoin\u2019s core ethos of decentralization, innovation, and\xa0security,\u201d Blockstream said in a release. When bitcoin was first developed by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, certain limitations were built in, with the goal of maintaining a stable release of coins over time as an incentive to the decentralized mining community to keep the system running. Any changes to the system must be approved by the mining community. As the system has grown, these limitations have grown more constricting. The debate over raising the cap on block sizes earlier this year, for instance, sparked a major rift in the community. These limits have made it harder to build products for other uses on top of bitcoin, and many decided it was simply easier to build entirely new systems. Ethereum and Ripple are building separate platforms based off bitcoin\u2019s core technology. Firms like Symbiont and Overstock have built platforms aimed specifically at the traditional financial system\u2019s settlement and clearing business. Still others, like ItBit, R3 CEV\u2019s consortium, and Digital Asset Holdings, are also developing products aimed at Wall Street. Liquid is Blockstream\u2019s response to these competitors. It\u2019s not unlike Ethereum, or Ripple for that matter; all of them take the underlying technology, but scuttle all the elements that place the currency as the central product. In this alternate system, the currency is reduced to a token used solely to represent transactions. Think, for example, about an online system for land or title transfers. The real world transaction is \u201cembedded\u201d in the token, and recorded as it changes hands across the digital platform, but the token itself has no intrinsic value. The difference with Liquid is the bitcoin peg. Developers can build the myriad kinds of new applications that are being thought about elsewhere, but ultimately have an attachment back to the digital currency itself. The transactions can be seamlessly moved from the Liquid platform to bitcoin, and vice versa. This allows developers to take advantage of the size and scale of bitcoin, without being hampered by the limitations of the mining community. Individual bitcoins can be traded as their own currency, or as tokens in a 2.0-type transaction.

The new investment increases Ripple\u2019s Series A total, first announced in May at $28 million, to $32 million. The firm has raised $41 million in total. Santander will get a seat on Ripple\u2019s board. Ripple also formed a partnership with global consulting firm Accenture whereby the latter will offer Ripple products to its clients. Santander established its venture-capital fund, InnoVentures, last year and gave it a $100 million war-chest to tap. The bank, like most others, has been getting involved in the fintech world, with an R&D group and \u201ccryptolab\u201d in Madrid that works with startups, and with InnoVentures has been looking at the potential of Ripple and other platforms in the crypto world, like Ethereum and the R3 CEV consortium. \u201cWe think that the distributed ledger is a technology that will significantly disrupt many processes within a bank,\u201d said Mariano Belinky, managing partner at InnoVentures. The Accenture partnership is novel. The firm\u2019s consulting service focused on commercial customers will add Ripple as a product it will offers clients looking for payments options. According to Tim Summers, Accenture\u2019s managing director for connected commerce, the firm has taken a keen interest in blockchain-based products, and has been seeing rising demand among its clients. \u201cThe opportunities here are significant, I think, when it comes to streamlining business,\u201d said Mr. Summers. \u201cThere\u2019s this opportunity to grow existing markets, go after new markets, and create new products.\u201d Ripple, founded in 2012, has focused on building a payments system that banks could use for money transfers and cross-border payments. Its currency, also called ripple, is a part of but secondary to the network. Instead of bitcoin\u2019s anonymous network of users, Ripple wants to build a network of banks that act as the \u201cnodes\u201d maintaining the system. Fintech startups increasingly are building services based on the technology underlying bitcoin, like Symbiont and\xa0ItBit, and more banks are either investing in, or putting together groups to work on experimenting with and building their own services. \u201cIt seems like a completely different group of competitors\u201d has come into the industry in the last year or so, Ripple CEO and co-founder Chris Larsen said. \u201cThese are more professional competitors.\u201d \u201cThe technology\u2019s ready,\u201d Mr. Larsen said of his own firm\u2019s platform. \u201cIt\u2019s ready for adoption.

New York State Department of Financial Services granted Gemini Trust Co. a limited liability trust charter, holding it to the regulatory standards of a trust bank and allowing it to operate as a regulated financial-services institution. The trust charter is just the second one granted by the DFS to a bitcoin-related business. ItBit, a New York-based bitcoin exchange, received one in the spring. The charter gives Gemini the ability to offer services as a registered money transmitter, and be held to the same capital rules and regulatory structure as established banks like State Street and Rockefeller Trust Co. The trust charter is from a state institution, but in practice gives Gemini the ability to take deposits from any customers and operate in all 50 U.S. states. This is the third bitcoin-related institution to which the DFS has given regulatory approval. Circle Internet Financial earlier this month received the first BitLicense \u2013 a separate kind of charter designed especially for digital-currency businesses; 22 other businesses have applied for the latter, and more approvals are expected. \u201cWe are continuing to move forward on licensing and chartering virtual currency firms,\u201d DFS acting superintendent Anthony Albanese said in a release. \u201cSmart, targeted regulation that helps protect consumers and prevent illicit activity is vital to the long-term future of this industry.\u201d Gemini will be begin operations on Thursday. The exchange will allow customers to buy, sell, and hold bitcoins. Bitcoin deposits will be held in an offline vault; fiat deposits will be held with New York-based commercial bank Signature Bank. The exchange is open to both individual and institutional investors, but the twins are keenly focused on attracting institutional business. It is the second bitcoin-related product launched by Winklevoss Capital. In February 2014, it launched its own bitcoin index, the Winkdex. It is still awaiting regulatory approval from the SEC for a planned bitcoin ETF it first proposed in 2013. The attempt to lure Wall Street to trade bitcoin has taken a backseat to the Street\u2019s own interest in appropriating the technology. Still, there is a movement to attract institutional investors into bitcoin. There are now two exchanges that meet regulatory requirements \u2013 Gemini and ItBit. In March, Bitcoin Investment Trust launched an over-the-counter bitcoin ETF; the Winklevoss twins are still awaiting SEC approval for their own ETF as well. As with the ETF, the idea behind Gemini is to create stable, reliable products for trading bitcoin that will appeal to institutional investors outside the niche market that has so far defined bitcoin trading.\xa0 Large institutions have so far had few reliable options for investing in the digital currency.\xa0The biggest bitcoin exchanges are currently all based outside the U.S. \u201cBringing them (investors) into the fold is going to be a large catalyst for bitcoin,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss said. A lot has changed in the digital-currency world since the twins first announced their intention launch Gemini. Back then, the biggest issue was bitcoin\u2019s volatility and plunging price. Now, the price has stabilized, but the focus has shifted. There is intense interest over bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology, broadly called the blockchain, and much less over bitcoin itself. Despite this, the twins believe that the digital currency has a future. \u201cYou can\u2019t just hack your way through it,\u201d Cameron said of building up bitcoin as an asset class. \u201cWe have to put the plane together in the hanger, do a bunch of test flights, and then take off.\u201d Email: paul.vigna@wsj.com; Twitter: @paulvigna', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/10/05/bitbeat-winklevoss-twins-gemini-exchange-gets-trust-license/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 5, 9, 30), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Winklevoss Twins&rsquo; Gemini Exchange Gets Trust License &ndash; BitBeat'}, {'articleText': u' A Boston-based bitcoin startup became the first firm to receive a license, allowing it to offer digital-currency services in New York. The New York Department of Financial Services issued it first \u201cBitLicense\u201d to Circle Internet Financial Inc., a firm founded two years ago by Jeremy Allaire and backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The goal of BitLicenses is to create a framework that allows digital-currency firms to build their services, but at the same time to protect consumers with various requirements, such as anti-money laundering compliance and cyber security guidelines. With the new regulatory approval, Circle can now offer a mobile payment service that can send and receive and hold U.S. dollars, in addition to bitcoin. The revamped service will also allow users to send and receive payments via a text message, and doesn\u2019t make users convert into and out of bitcoin. That is handled by the service automatically. Other currencies, like the euro, will be added as the company gets regulatory approval overseas, something it is pursuing.

The first BitLicense marks another step in bitcoin\u2019s development. The BitLicense was first introduced by Benjamin Lawsky, then DFS superintendent, in January 2014. The debate continues about how much the BitLicense has dampened the business climate for bitcoin. Some firms, like GoCoin, have publicly decided to \u201cgeofence\u201d New York, meaning they won\u2019t operate there.

The DFS said that 22 companies have applied for the license, which carries a $5,000 application fee, and it expects more approvals soon. \u201cWe are trying to move expeditiously,\u201d said Matthew Anderson, the deputy superintendent for public affairs at the DFS.

The 21 Bitcoin Computer, which goes on sale Monday, is a small, bare bones, Linux-based piece of hardware in which the bitcoin protocol is a feature of the operating system. Any products or services built with it \u2013 games or music or any online content \u2013 would have bitcoin built in as a component. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about it,\u201d said Ben Horowitz, a co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, which\xa0led the startup\u2019s funding earlier this year. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s completely missing that I think would make the Internet better would be machine-to-machine payments. It\u2019s just amazingly hard to do right now.\u201d The 21 computer is aimed at developers rather than consumers, and is part of the company\u2019s wider goal of turning bitcoin into an Internet protocol, a common language shared between connected devices. The computer will sell for about $400 and will be available to order beginning on Monday, and will ship in November. The computer\u2019s operating system will include a full copy of bitcoin\u2019s code and related software that will allow developers to make bitcoin a core feature of the products they build. It also uses a chip 21 unveiled earlier this year that is linked to 21\u2019s mining pool and provide a steady stream of bitcoin for the user. With this computer, 21 CEO Balaji Srinivasan explained, users can build a service or site in which conceivably every page view can be monetized. \u201cThe utility of bitcoin up until this point has been the speculation value,\u201d Mr. Srinivasan said. \u201cWe have a new, pretty strong use case for bitcoin.\u201d Mr. Horowitz compared the potential of this computer to early web browsers and his time helping build Netscape back in the 1990s. They were creating a platform, but couldn\u2019t know what would be built on top of it. \xa0\u201cThe first website we got excited about at Netscape was this guy who built a webcam to monitor his coffee pot,\u201d he said. It may seem frivolous, but it showed that people would actually use the browser in creative and new ways, and it was a small sign of what was coming. \xa0\u201cThese things can\u2019t happen without some enabling technology.\u201d Machine-to-machine payments could be a solution to any number of problems today, Mr. Horowitz said. He mentioned services like Netflix, or media companies. \u201cIf I could read stuff on the web for a small amount of money, and didn\u2019t have to open myself up for repeated charging or subscriptions I didn\u2019t want? That\u2019s a relatively straightforward application if you have machine-to-machine payments.\u201d Bitcoin rose to prominence as an alternative currency, but more recently its core technology has gained attention for its potential to modernize the financial system. 21\u2019s vision involves creating a network of machines that could essentially talk to each other across the bitcoin network, creating a platform for machine-to-machine payments.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $230.31, up 0.03% (via CoinDesk) - Nine of the biggest global banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse, and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, have joined a consortium formed by product-development firm R3 CEV. The aim of the group is to establish protocols and standards for using blockchain technologies in financial services. The idea is to develop the kind of standard platforms that could be used across the global capital markets and represents just the latest in what has been a string of endeavors announced this year by Wall Street banks to delve into the world of bitcoin. In addition to those three banks, Barclays, BBVA, State Street Corp., Royal Bank of Scotland, and UBS also signed up for the consortium (Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is the ninth bank, according to reports). Details of the partnership, what each bank is contributing to the effort, how much capital in terms of money and manpower, weren\u2019t disclosed. The partnership will see the banks collaborate on research and development and experimentation, and each will be expected to contribute manpower, financing and products, according to R3 CEO David Rutter. The effort has three main goals, Mr. Rutter told MoneyBeat. The first is to develop a platform that could handle the billions of dollars worth of transactions that occur in the financial industry. The second is to build a sort of sandbox for experimenting with these new tools, and the third is to learn from these experiments what works and where the technology can best be used in financial services. What\u2019s attractive about the partnership, according to Barclays\u2019 Simon Taylor, is that it offers a place where banks that are normally competitors can collaborate. Also, he was impressed by the team R3 had gathered together, which includes Richard Gendal Brown, an engineer formerly at IBM, and Tim Swanson, an author and consultant who is well known in the digital-currency industry. \u201cYou have a collaborative space to build things with people who have done it before,\u201d said Mr. Taylor, a vice president at the bank who oversees much of its new-tech efforts. Interest in bitcoin and the technology that powers it has been a growing source of interest to the financial industry. This year has seen a number of efforts on the Street, from both startups and established banks, to use the blockchain as the basis of new platforms and products. One startup, Symbiont, released its \u201cSmart Securities\u201d platform this summer, and another, ItBit, is preparing to unveil its own version, called BankChain, later this year. Blythe Masters\u2019 Digital Asset Holdings has a product, and Patrick Byrne\u2019s Overstock.com launched its own version of a platform for issuing and trading debt securities, called t0, as well. Citigroup Citi Ventures has been experimenting with the technology, developing an experimental version it called Citicoin. The R3 group will look to meet quarterly milestones, Mr. Rutter said, and will be open to new members, banks as well as startups. He expects to announce more banks that will be joining the group in the future. Barclay\u2019s Mr. Taylor sees this as the beginning of a long-term project. \u201cEverybody\u2019s looking for that first killer use-case,\u201d he said, but the reality is there are a lot of good ones that need to be thought through and proven first. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take years, and it\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d he said. \u201cAny big structural change is difficult.\u201d - ARK Investment Management, a New York ETF manager that specializes in high-tech investments, put an undisclosed amount into Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust ETF, marking the first time a traditional ETF that trades on a public exchange has invested in a bitcoin ETF.

They are then ranked on a public leader board and incentivized with prizes. In addition to sponsorships, it will also sell the real-time data it generates to groups including hedge funds, research firms and political campaigns. \u201cOur goal is to connect people to content and do that in a way that is interactive with events they care about,\u201d Mr. DePetris said of Pivit. \u201cIt\u2019s a polling mechanism, but not really, and it\u2019s a market place, but it doesn\u2019t come across looking like one.\u201d The use of Digital Asset\u2019s technology is the latest example of firms testing the potential uses of digital ledgers such as blockchain, which is the technology behind bitcoin.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $229.68, up 1% (via CoinDesk) - Barclays is working with a startup to run a pilot program testing bitcoin as a payment system, the latest in a long string of forays by Wall Street firms looking at the digital currency and the technology behind it. Barclays and the bitcoin startup, Safello, will build a program that would allow charities to accept bitcoin. While the details are being kept under wraps, Barclays said it is interested in bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology, and this appears to be the first time a big bank has directly undertaken a live experiment with the digital currency. Safello, which operates a bitcoin exchange and related services and was founded in 2013, signed a proof-of-concept contract with Barclays back in June, while it was in the middle of the summer session of the bank\u2019s accelerator. The charities program will be the first use case in that proof. For Safello, it\u2019s a big step, a chance to work directly with a Tier One bank, but this is what it\u2019s been aiming for all along, CEO Frank Schuil told MoneyBeat. \u201cWe\u2019re basically trying to create a bridge between the traditional finance world and the bitcoin world,\u201d he said. There\u2019s been a surge in interest in bitcoin among Wall Street banks. Most are interested in the underlying technology, the main feature of which is the open ledger called the blockchain. The thinking is an open, public ledger that\u2019s run by and maintained across a network of connected, distributed computers could offer significant benefits in transaction costs and settlement times. Some banks have taken small investment positions in startups, some have experimented with the technology on their own in the lab, so to speak. The Barclays experiment, though, is the first (to our knowledge at least) to test it directly in a live environment. Nasdaq (not a bank) is building a pilot program into its Private Market exchange. Safello went through Barclays accelerator program in London over the summer, run in partnership with Techstars, a private accelerator program. These accelerator programs have been spreading to more big banks, and there are benefits on both sides. The startups get access to the banks, and the banks get to take a peak inside the leading edge of technology and innovation. Safello has raised about $1 million through several channels, Mr. Schuil said, including traditional investors \u2013 like prominent bitcoin names such as Barry Silbert, Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver \u2013 as well as angel investors and crowdfunding. Also, Techstars took a small equity stake in the firm, something it does with all the companies in the program (and a regular feature of these programs). Barclays has no investment stake in the company.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $234.84, up 4.2% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin\u2019s price has been under pressure amid the roiling block-size debate, and the selling that resulted from that debate\xa0sparked a \u201cflash crash\u201d on one of the biggest exchanges that pulled the price down across the cryptocurrency\u2019s global markets. Bitcoin was lately trading around $235 \u2013 its lowest price since early June \u2013 down about 12% from $265 on Aug. 14, the day before Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn released Bitcoin XT, their alternative version of the bitcoin protocol designed to support larger block sizes within the blockchain\xa0(if you\u2019ve no idea what that all refers to, you have a lot of catching up to do; start here, and work your way back). The acrimonious fight over bitcoin\u2019s future represented by that release has pushed the price down. However, one day this week, the price fell\xa0even further on one of the exchanges where people buy and sell the cryptocurrency. Late Tuesday night, the price tumbled all the way to $162 on Bitfinex. It\u2019s being called a \u201cflash crash,\u201d but the reality is this crash wasn\u2019t driven by some computer glitch, or exchange failure, but rather by margin calls. Bitfinex offers margin trading, which allows traders to ramp up their leverage (from what we\u2019ve seen of them, bitcoin\u2019s speculative traders love this kind of stuff; these guys could easily give Wall Street\u2019s casino hotshots a run for their money). Now, in a traditional setting, those trades have position limits. Should the position in question fall below the bottom limit, it will generate a sell order, and traders will get one of the historically most distressing interactions on the Street: the margin call. Literally, a broker calls up the trader and demands an additional deposit of money to cover the position (the margin call is so iconic, it even got its own movie). In bitcoin trading, the margin call is executed automatically. So when a number of positions on the exchange hit their limits amid the general selloff, the margin calls were executed automatically; sell orders were generated to raise enough money to cover the positions (or, in some cases we\u2019d imagine, the positions were liquidated). The orders that were placed amid the \u201ccrash\u201d were legitimate sell orders that were executed as a result of margins being called, Bitfinex later said on Twitter. Tradeblock, a data and research site, analyzed the trading patterns and concluded that the cause was indeed the automated margin calls. The selling that occurred during the dump were legitimate sell orders and positions being margin called. Lenders were not affected. \u2014 Bitfinex.com (@bitfinex) August 19, 2015  - It\u2019s not all dark news in the bitcoin world these days.

The idea is to raise enough to buy prenatal vitamins for 2,000 expectant mothers in Sierra Leone and Liberia. ChangeTip users can make donations directly from their account to Direct Relief via Twitter; every mention will result in a $5 donation. ChangeTip says there are no transaction fees, so 100% of the funds donated will go to the cause, and it will also produce what it calls \u201csocial proof,\u201d pictures of the vitamins being delivered in Africa.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $256.74, down 0.4% (via CoinDesk) - Over the weekend, a new version of bitcoin\u2019s software was released, Bitcoin XT.\xa0It\u2019s a line in the sand \u2013 a \u201chard fork\u201d in the parlance \u2013 and an attempt to force the bitcoin community into accepting changes to the underlying protocol that purportedly will allow the system to grow. But it\u2019s unleashed a torrent of rancor within the community, which now looks like very much like the proverbial house divided against itself. The debate revolves around a seemingly small point: whether or not to allow bitcoin\u2019s open ledger, the blockchain, to accept block sizes greater than 1 megabyte. The blocks comprise individual bitcoin transactions; the transactions are packaged into blocks, confirmed, and added to the ledger. The ledger is maintained by the decentralized, independent consortium of miners. Today the size limit is being pressed as the system grows. The problem is that changing the limit at this point will alter the economics of bitcoin mining. Any change to the software requires agreement among the miners, and many have been vocal in their opposition. This debate has been brewing for months, without conclusion. To force a solution, the group in support of larger block sizes, led by Gavin Andresen, released Bitcoin XT on Saturday. It\u2019s virtually identical to bitcoin\u2019s existing protocol, now called Bitcoin Core, with the critical difference being the limit on block size has been lifted. Right now, it\u2019s running as a concurrent system, open to anyone to download and run. If it gets to a point where it comprises 75% of the blocks being mined, the remaining 25% will have two weeks to switch over to the new system. Mike Hearn, one of the core developers, explained the rationale in a long, sharply worded post on Medium that invoked the name and vision of bitcoin\u2019s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. \u201cSatoshi\u2019s plan brought us all together. It changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of us across the globe. Some of us quit our jobs, others devoted their spare time to the project, still others founded companies and even moved across the world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat vision is now in jeopardy. In recent months it\u2019s become clear that a small group of people have a radically different plan for Bitcoin.\u201d That has inflamed the opposition. It got so heated on reddit, a rowdy place to begin with, that some posts were reportedly being censored that even mentioned XT. One debate on Twitter involving prominent names in bitcoin and cryptography, including Adam Back and Ryan Selkis, even contemplated whether or not the Andresen pod could be held legally accountable if the fork led to some bitcoins being lost: .@twobitidiot someone mentioned hypothetical: if you lost your Bitcoins as a result of Gavin network split \u2013 would you hold him accountable? \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) August 17, 2015  To be fair, bitcoin\u2019s open nature means this debate is happening in the public square, where a similar debate in a private enterprise would likely be kept behind closed doors. Still, the issue here is existential. Bitcoin is code, nothing more. What gives it value is the community that uses it. If that community tears itself in two, bitcoin could lose whatever momentum it\u2019s had. If bitcoin\u2019s community appears unwilling or unable to comport itself, it dissuades others from joining. None of this is happening in a bubble, either. Myriad enterprises are working on taking bitcoin\u2019s underlying concepts and building something that looks similar, but is different in key ways. New York firm Symbiont earlier this month unveiled a service it calls Smart Securities, which allows users \u2013 ideally Wall Street firms \u2013 to issue assets over a digital network. The key difference is that unlike bitcoin\u2019s decentralized, open platform, Symbiont\u2019s is what\u2019s called a \u201cpermissioned ledger.\u201d In essense, it\u2019s a closed-loop system, offering the speed of bitcoin, but in a system under control of a centralized group of users (in this case, the banks that would use the system). Across town, ItBit is also working on a settlement product called Bankchain. They are not alone. There are other startups working on implementing the technology, as well as Wall Street\u2019s banks themselves. It appears the age of cryptocurrency is on the cusp of flowering. The question is whether bitcoin will be part of it.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $281.98, down 0.9% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin has reached out and touched Wall Street.\xa0Two platforms for trading so-called smart contracts launched (quite coincidentally) on Tuesday in New York City, one from Overstock.com and another from tech-startup Symbiont. Both aim to offer a faster, cheaper, and more trustworthy platform for issuing and trading a range of debt instruments. Both also represent the first bitcoin-related enterprises to directly target a part of Wall Street\u2019s day-to-day business, though neither sees itself as a usurper. \u201cI\u2019m not coming to Wall Street like a Viking with an ax,\u201d Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, a prominent bitcoin proselytizer, said during a presentation. \u201cWe want to license this. We want to work with people here.\u201d The twin launchings represent the continued evolution of bitcoin, fintech and Wall Street. This is, to our knowledge at least, the first time a financial service based on the technology that underlies bitcoin has been launched that directly targets services offered in the existing financial world. Not that Wall Street sees it as a threat, apparently. Both Mr. Byrne and Symbiont CEO Mark Smith said they have serious interest from myriad parties on Wall Street, and plan to license out their technology. In the morning, Symbiont unveiled its Smart Securities platform at a small gathering off Wall Street at the offices of the financial-services firm Capco that was attended by investors in the firm, representatives of financial services like the clearing-house service Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC),\xa0Morgan Stanley, and UBS. The team gave a live demonstration of the platform, which included a handful of debt securities issued by SenaHill Partners (an investor in Symbiont), which were\xa0the first instruments to trade on the platform. About 10 minutes after Mr. Smith began his presentation, the confirmation notice came across and he announced the trades had cleared. Such a system, he said later, takes counterparty risk down to \u201czero.\u201d In the evening, Overstock and Mr. Byrne hosted a flashier launch party for several hundred people at Nasdaq headquarters overlooking Times Square, at which they unveiled their version of the smart-contract trading platform,\xa0t0.com (that\u2019s \u201ct\u201d and zero, not the letter \u201co;\u201d it\u2019s a play off \u201cT+3,\u201d Street shorthand for the three days it takes a contract to settle). Mr. Byrne unveiled it in a typically colorful, impassioned speech that included references to the Torah, Martin Luther, \u201cthe holy church of capitalism,\u201d the development of the Nasdaq and electronic exchanges, and his own sometimes contentious\xa0history with Wall Street. Smart contracts are vehicles that have all the covenants and conditions of a traditional security written into them\u2013interest rates, maturities, and the like\u2013and utilize the bitcoin blockchain for their verification and trading.\xa0They have been an idea in cryptography circles since at least the 1990s. Nick Szabo, a digital-currency pioneer,\xa0was writing about them in 1997. It wasn\u2019t until a few years after bitcoin\u2019s launch in 2009 that people started to seriously plan out how to use bitcoin\u2019s protocol to support these digital contracts. The settlement business has been viewed as one of the most likely\xa0places for various cutting-edge services and fintech firms to make inroads. The current system works, but is comparatively inefficient, and outdated. \u201cThe basic elements of the current value transfer process have been in place for over 150 years,\u201d the World Economic Forum noted in a report this spring.\xa0It involves a number of intermediaries, such clearing houses like the DTCC, and various layers of banks and correspondent banks. Settlement usually takes several days, the costs are high, and involve counterparty risk. This last was exposed most painfully during the financial crisis, when parts of the the financial system essentially froze because banks were afraid to do business with each other for fear the other would fail before their transactions had settled. Using a bitcoin-based system offers several potential benefits.\xa0First off, it is faster. A bitcoin transaction clears in about 10 minutes, compared to three days for a traditional debt instrument to clear. The costs are lower. Having an automated system where the terms are part of the program can also bolster confidence in the contracts themselves, a June report from Santander InnoVentures noted. Such instruments \u201ccan increase investor confidence in products whose underlying assets are now opaque (such as securitizations) or where property rights are made uncertain by the role of central authorities.\u201d The new platforms are not coming from rebellious bitcoin startups. Symbiont counts former NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer as an investor. Overstock is a Nasdaq-listed public company with $1.5 billion in 2014 sales. People familiar with Mr. Byrne\u2019s long history may be surprised that he chose a site like Nasdaq for the launch. More than a decade ago, he was involved in a bitter, pitched fight against naked short sellers who were targeting Overstock shares. But, saying that he was raised on free markets, he viewed it as a sort of homecoming, and hoped that these contracts would put an end to naked shorting and other abuses. To illustrate the platform, Overstock\xa0last week conducted the first trade: a $5 million, unsecured bond that was bought by the New York brokerage First New York. Overstock actually covered the firm\u2019s risk by subsequently loaning it $5 million; Mr. Byrne said the transaction was a chance to \u201cblow out the pipes,\u201d to show that the system worked. \u201cThink about what this is,\u201d he said on a visit to the Journal\u2019s office on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s really about getting the existing capital markets to be crypto-capital markets.\u201d Email: paul.vigna@wsj.com; Twitter:@paulvigna', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/08/05/bitbeat-smart-contracts-land-on-wall-street/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 8, 5, 11, 36), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: Smart Contracts Land on Wall Street'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, the latest in cryptocurrency news and analysis. Bitcoin Latest Price: $284.19, down 1.1% (via CoinDesk) - Ethereum, the much-hyped, much-discussed platform\xa0for supporting smart contracts and other kinds of decentralized applications, officially launched the first phase of its project on Thursday. It\u2019s the first concrete sign that an idea that began with one person more than a year-and-a-half ago is close to becoming reality. If it takes off, Ethereum promises to take the technology underlying bitcoin and open it up to supporting virtually any product or service that could be digitized, from \u201csmart\u201d contracts that enforce their own rules to trading platforms to supply-chain management, to voting, gambling, insurance, healthcare, or data storage. Called \u201cFrontier,\u201d this phase is a bare-bones site that is up and running but isn\u2019t exactly \u201clive\u201d yet,\xa0Stephan Tual, Ethereum\u2019s chief operating officer, explained in a phone interview with MoneyBeat. \u201cIt\u2019s in a thawing phase,\u201d he said, open to developers to begin working on. Some time next week, according to plan, it will go live, but with more than 70 teams already working on the platform, he said he\u2019s happy with it. \u201cI\u2019m quite happy, actually,\u201d Mr. Tual said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year and a half of blood, sweat, and tears, but we finally got there.\u201d This first phase essentially opens up Ethereum\u2019s blockchain to the public, but it\u2019s only the first phase of the project. There are two more planned over the next 12 months: \u201cMetropolis,\u201d which will feature a user-friendly web browser, and \u201cSerenity,\u201d a phase designed to scale-up the platform. If all goes according to plan, a year from now there will be a well-built, broad, public-facing \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 decentralized platform that could support any variety of applications and uses. \u201cWe have quite a lot on our plate,\u201d Mr. Tual said. Think of it this way: Bitcoin (and lets break with our usual style here and use the capital B in reference to the system) is a program designed specifically to support a currency system, bitcoin. Its key feature is the online ledger, the blockchain. Ethereum shares some technology, but its design goal isn\u2019t just to support a currency, it is to support any kind of application that can make use of the blockchain technology. \u201cEthereum is an alternative decentralized ledger protocol, not an alternative cryptocurrency,\u201d the writer and entrepreneur William Mougayar (and adviser to the development team) wrote in\xa0a post that explains it very well.\xa0\xa0\u201cEthereum\u2019s ideological lineage contains as much BitTorrent, Java and Freenet as it does Bitcoin.\u201d Ethereum was first developed by Vitalik Buterin, who was a few months shy of his 20th birthday in January 2014 when he first posted his idea for the platform to the GitHub collaboration site. This was a time before the idea of blockchain-based applications \u2013 apart from bitcoin \u2013 had taken hold. But Mr. Buterin\u2019s project quickly drummed up a lot of attention and support. In the summer of 2014, the team he\u2019d gathered around the project held a crowdfunding sale of ether that raised $18 million. The blockchain, whether bitcoin\u2019s, Ethereum\u2019s or any other that may be developed, is an online, public ledger of transactions that can support a range of applications beyond managing a currency, anything from supply-chain management to \u201csmart\u201d contracts to even voting. Etherum is designed to be the backbone for all those, and any others that folks can think up.\xa0When everything is built and up and running, it should allow anybody with at least some coding skills to build products and apps, rather than just Silicon Valley-trained engineers. One of the services being developed on Ethereum is called Provenance. It\u2019s an application that will allow retailers to track not only their products, but the materials that go into their products, allowing them to certify their products as genuine and thwart knock-offs. Another group, the startup Augur, is working on \xa0a prediction market that would allow people to make bets on, and tap the proverbial wisdom of the crowd, on anything from political contests to the Oscars and sporting events.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $286.92, down 0.6% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin\u2019s growth may indeed be happening at a faster pace than the growth of the Internet back in the 1990s, which has insiders all abuzz, but the cryptocurrency is still to most people an inchoate, confusing concept, assuming they don\u2019t just dismiss it outright. To address that, a small group of insiders gathered in the New Hampshire hills in July with the goal of producing a comprehensive assessment of where bitcoin is, where it may go, and what might prevent it from getting there. Consumers Research is a Washington, D.C.-based trade group whose leaders \u2014 Executive Director Joe Colangelo and Director of Operations Kyle Burgess \u2014 have taken a keen interest in bitcoin. They organized the three-day trip to Bretton Woods, sight of the\xa0famous conference after World War II ended, with the idea of getting away from the drumbeat of the world, to a quiet place where they could concentrate. Now\u2019s a good time to assess bitcoin. The price of the cryptocurrency has been more stable this year than at any point in its short history. Since the NYSE and other financial players invested in Coinbase in January, there\u2019s been a marked change in tone on Wall Street toward the technology. At the same time, while the trading market for bitcoin continues to expand, public adoption has slowed down. Bitcoin\u2019s had a hard time lodging itself in the public mind past the techies and libertarians who were initially and naturally drawn to it. For all the talk about bitcoin, the media coverage, the books, documentaries, and myriad conferences around the globe, digital currencies and the technology underlying them remain more potential than payoff. Where does bitcoin\u2019s real future lie? That\u2019s the question the group sought to answer. The group of 20 included Victoria van Eyk, ChangeTip\u2019s vice president of community development, Jinyoung Lee Englund from the Digital Currency Council, and Michael Casey, our former partner here at the Journal and now senior adviser, Digital Currency Initiative at MIT Media Lab. They spent three days working in rotating groups on the paper, a rough draft of which clocks in at about 15,000 words. The goal is to produce a document that explains what bitcoin is, what parts of the economy it could potentially change, and what the roadblocks to that change could be. The idea moreover was to write a paper that would be broad enough to appeal to both policy makers and regulators, the business community, the bitcoin community, and even the general public. \u201cGoals exist both on a large, strategic scale such as human empowerment, and also on a more tactical scale, such as specific use cases,\u201d read the draft version of the paper. \u201cPeople brought their best selves to it,\u201d Mr. Colangelo said. The next steps are to get it back to the group for revisions within the next few weeks, and then even open it up to public forums like Reddit and GitHub for commentary. The goal is to produce a \u201cliving, breathing document,\u201d he said. We\u2019ll be interested in seeing where the paper goes, and not just because our old friend is involved in it. One of bitcoin\u2019s biggest challenges, really, has been simply explaining why it\u2019s a valuable concept. If this group can manage that, the three days would have been worth it. (Paul Vigna) UPDATE: Victoria van Eyk is ChangeTip\u2019s vice president of community development; an earlier version of this post said she was the startup\u2019s founder. Also Coinbase\u2019s John Collins, who was expected to be at the retreat, did not ultimately attend.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $286.83, down 7.5% (via CoinDesk) - The world\u2019s gaze has been fixated on Europe, and the debt crisis that threatens to tear apart the very symbol of a united Continent, the euro. This had some effect, on the surface at least, on bitcoin, which crested this weekend over $300 for the first time since March. But bitcoin has its own crisis brewing, and both offer valuable lessons on what makes a currency valuable\u2013real, digital, or otherwise. The outlines of the euro crisis are well-known, revolving around the question of Greece and her unsustainable debts, and how much her euro compatriots are prepared to backstop her. But it is far more a political than economic crisis.\xa0When people say the euro is irreversible, what they are really saying is that \u201cEurope\u201d is irreversible. The euro is part of a grand project to try and forge a common, shared identity among the Continent\u2019s historically squabbling nations. It was an attempt to jury-rig a community among disparate nationalities. \u201cThe most important currency has been lost and that is trust,\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday ahead of a meeting of eurozone leaders, and while there\u2019s sure to be massive debate about the role each leader has played, this comment rings true. Without trust, the euro project is doomed. Money, the author Felix Martin said, is a \u201csocial technology,\u201d a method of accounting that is agreed upon by a community of users and which binds them together. Whether it\u2019s backed by gold, software code, or empty promises, money is as strong only as the faith of the community. If there\u2019s no trust, there\u2019s no community. If there\u2019s no community, there\u2019s no currency. \u201cTrust is an easy thing to lose and a hard one to rebuild,\u201d Convergex strategist Nicholas Colas wrote on Monday, reflecting on the Greek crisis. If the euro is nothing more than a club that members can enter and leave as their tempers dictate, the permanence of the currency will vanish. Most people are speculating that the connection between the Greece and bitcoin is that the latter somehow represents a solution to the problems of the former, or countries like Italy, Spain, or even France that may find themselves in trouble if the dominoes start falling. But the real connection, seems to us, is this issue of trust. Bitcoin is enduring its own trust crisis\xa0as well, a fact that is inconveniently ironic. The cryptocurrency is designed to be trustless, run by its own rigidly coded logic, backed by math and encryption that rendered third parties moot. However, even the best software needs humans to oversee it, and this is where bitcoin can\u2019t escape the trust issue. Bitcoin\u2019s crisis revolves around what seems an arcane, small matter: the maximum size of an individual block in the blockchain, the ledger at the heart of the system. But it\u2019s not a small matter. The trick with bitcoin is that even though it\u2019s a decentralized system, it still needs somebody running it, and they need an incentive to do so. Satoshi Nakamoto came up with a novel solution: in exchange for confirming transactions and running the software that maintains the systems, users vie for a shot at newly minted bitcoin. It\u2019s a competitive, mathematical lottery that is lucrative enough to keep miners interested. But it\u2019s an expensive proposition, so expensive that it now takes enterprise-level operations to remain in the game.\xa0Altering the block size alters the rewards, and will make it too expensive for some of those players. Apart from pure self-interest, though, opponents say if you knock out these players, the number of miners will be winnowed down, with the result that control will be concentrated into an even smaller group of players, essentially centralizing further a system that hangs its hat on decentralization. The trick is that you need the current clutch of miners to agree to and implement any software changes, and right now they are\u2013selfishly and reasonably\u2013resisting that. Changing the block-size limit is technically simple, but the debate over it has opened a rift that is in its own way as gaping and nasty as the one over Greece. The fight has gotten acrimonious, and nasty, and it\u2019s happening in public view, on Twitter and Reddit and message boards. Trust is being eroded, and trust is the real currency of the community.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$269.71, up 0.02% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013BitFury, the bitcoin-mining operation based in Amsterdam, has announced a new round of fund raising, and plans to build another data center in the country of Georgia, as the firm looks to stay ahead of its peers in a highly competitive and fast-changing mining industry. The firm announced on Thursday that it has raised $20 million in a third round, from investors including DRW Venture Capital, iTech Capital, and Georgian Co-Investment Fund. It raised $20 million last summer as well, and has raised $60 million since its founding in 2011. The company did not disclose its valuation. Even though the firm says it is profitable, the money is necessary because of the high costs of mining and the extreme competition, said George Kikvadze, BitFury\u2019s vice chairman. Running the data centers and acquiring more and more powerful chips is an extremely expensive proposition. \u201cYou need access to capital,\u201d Mr. Kikvadze said, \u201cas well as execution on silicon. That\u2019s super important. If you don\u2019t come up with the chip in time, and develop your data centers on time, you\u2019ll be squeezed out.\u201d There\u2019s been a shake-up in the mining industry over the past year, as the costs of the mining arms race, as well as the missteps typical in a nascent industry, have crushed a number of players, like CoinTerra, Aquifer, BitMine and Butterfly Labs. Mr. Kikvadze reckoned that a year ago, he had about 20 competitors. Now, he says, \u201cit\u2019s BitFury versus the Chinese pools.\u201d As bitcoin has grown over the years, the mining industry has gotten progressively more competitive, with the dominant form of computing power increasing from desktops to graphics cards to mainframes to dedicated semiconductor chips of increasingly smaller and more powerful designs. BitFury released a 28 nanometer chip several weeks ago, and in that time it\u2019s seen its share of the rise from about 6% to 16%, making it currently the largest private miner. Other miners, like KnCMiner, also have 28 nanometer chips (KnC has a 20 nanometer chip as well), and the arms race is taking that down very near what most consider the limits for chips. \u201cUntil we get to 16 nanometers, this race is going to go on,\u201d Mr. Kikvadze said. Of course, once you have a chip, you need the rest of the operation. BitFury recently shut down a data center in Finland that wasn\u2019t cost effective, and is planning to build a new one in Georgia. It already has another data center in Georgia, as well as one in Iceland, and is looking to build what would be a fourth in either the U.S. or Canada. The other big issue in the mining sector is the debate over the block-size limit. Some are pushing to raise the limit past the current 1 megabyte, but doing so changes the economics of mining, and raising the limit to eight or 20 megabytes, to say nothing of even larger sizes should bitcoin keep growing, would be likely to drive out even more competitors. That puts a company like BitFury in an unusual place. As a private, for-profit enterprise, less competition is a good thing. But this particular industry, bitcoin, makes a philosophical stand over centralization. Indeed, the fact that changing the block size would centralize mining into even fewer hands is one of the chief arguments of the crowd lobbying against the increase.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$254.48, down 1.23% (via\xa0CoinDesk) -When the BitLicense came out last month and many bitcoin startups moaned about the innovation-killing new compliance burdens from New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, the team at Ribbit.me celebrated. Retail rewards points \u2013 frequently flyer miles, hotel loyalty points, return-customer retailer programs and so forth \u2013 that make use of cryptocurrencies or their underlying blockchain technology were exempted from the regulations. For Ribbit.me, whose RibbitRewards are tradeable, blockchain-based loyalty tokens, \xa0that was good news. But even if regulators ignore \u201ccrypto-reward\u201d tokens, accountants could have a hard time with them. That\u2019s because, under one Ribbit.me model, founders Sean Dennis and Greg Simon claim to effectively make disappear the loyalty program liabilities that merchants have traditionally had to carry to recognize their future obligation to deliver goods and services against those points. With a viewpoint that upends the centuries-old principles of double-entry bookkeeping, Messrs. Dennis and Simon argue that if reward points are generated by an algorithm and issued in the form of a digital token on the blockchain, it creates an asset for the individual holder but the countervailing liability resides with the entire blockchain itself. That means \u201cthere\u2019s no liability on merchants\u2019 balance sheets anymore\u2026and that\u2019s what\u2019s huge,\u201d says Mr. Dennis. \u201cWe can take millions of dollars in liabilities off their balance sheets.\u201d As Mr. Simon concedes, this kind of thing could blow a bookkeeper\u2019s mind. \u201cWe tell them the liability disappears, because the blockchain belongs to no one,\u201d he says. Setting aside this head-scratching disappearing trick \u2013 and the question of how regulators might one day deal with it \u2013 the idea of blockchain-based reward points is stirring the imagination among retail business managers. A system in which reward points are issued as immediately tradable digital tokens on the universally verifiable and transparent blockchain ledger creates \u201cfar less friction\u201d for merchants, says Mr. Dennis. In part, that\u2019s because even if accountants eventually find creative ways for merchants to quantify their liabilities, blockchain solutions could create better methods for managing those obligations. That\u2019s especially so for franchisees in industries such as hospitality, where hotels operate under one branded chain but different owners, says Eric Piscini , a banking technology consultant at Deloitte in Atlanta. Because the blockchain \u201cis a public protocol [with crypto-rewards] you would know at any time what\xa0the liability is for the owner and what it is for the hotel chain,\u201d he says. Mr. Piscini, who heads up a worldwide team of 90 Deloitte staffers studying cryptocurrency solutions for the firm\u2019s clients, sees the blockchain potentially leapfrogging the loyalty points industry out of the same, outdated technology it has used ever since the concept began 20 years ago. Another advantage, according to Mr. Piscini: \u201cthe real-time aspect of the blockchain.\u201d \xa0Right now, \u201cif I go to a hotel and check in, stay a few nights, and then check out, I get my points a day or two later\u2026 On the blockchain you get those points in real time, which means I could use them in the hotel. It would incentivize me to use those points at the location. That\u2019s good for the merchant and good for the brand.\u201d The Ribbit.me founders also tout the benefits of buying and selling these tokens openly. In cases where the points trade on the blockchain and are recognized solely against a single, independently owned merchant, the retailer can buy up points on the open market \u2013 possibly at a discount to their redeemable value, which doesn\u2019t change for the customer \u2013 and reduce future debts. Alternatively, the merchant can sell tokens for cash if their value exceeds their redeemable value, thus quickly monetizing heightened demand for their products. In fact, says Ribbit.me\u2019s Mr. Simon, the transparently quoted floating token price could function as an ongoing measure of a firm\u2019s reputation, something to respond to with marketing or service changes. \u201cInstead of paying millions of dollars to consultants to tell you what your brand is worth, you could just look at what the consumer valuation is on the markets,\u201d he says. Naturally, the Ribbit.me founders also cite advantages for customers. For example, someone who really wants to buy a power drill but has insufficient amount of the desired hardware store\u2019s tokens can trade, say, tokens from a pharmacy and a hotel for more of the hardware store points. For the merchants, Mr. Dennis says, this cultivates a closer relationship with their most sought-after, loyal customers. Ribbit.me is far from the only innovator working on bitcoin-inspired rewards programs. The blogging and video site bitLanders has just launched a \u201cbitMiles\u201d concept where visitors to its site are rewarded in bitcoin-based points for performing various tasks. The underlying amounts of bitcoin are then divided among the user and various charities sponsored by bitLanders. \u201cThanks to bitMiles, time on the site grew from two to 16 minutes per session,\u201d says bitLanders CEO Francesco Rulli. There seem to be many creative solutions for crypto-rewards. Who knows what it might spawn in terms of creative accounting.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $265.80, up 3.6% (via CoinDesk) - It\u2019s time for another stress test, apparently. Coinwallet, the U.K.-based mining service that last week attempted to run its own stress test of bitcoin, is making another attempt on Tuesday, after that first event failed. The goal is to push bitcoin\u2019s transaction processing abilities to its limits, clog up the system, and prove a point in what has become a raging debate over how change in a decentralized community should be implemented. Individual blocks are the repositories into which every bitcoin transaction is recorded, and are used to build the open, online ledger, the blockchain, that lies at the heart of the decentralized system. Proponents argue the 1 megabyte limit needs to be raised as bitcoin grows. Opponents have a raft of reasons why that shouldn\u2019t happen, or if it should happen, exactly how\xa0it should happen, and the entire thing has become something of a referendum on how a decentralized, leadership network regulates itself. A number of blocks this morning were coming in routinely larger than 900 kilobytes (you can track these\xa0here\xa0and\xa0here), very close to the 1 megabyte limit that\u2019s written into bitcoin\u2019s code. That kind of transaction-stuffing should clog up the confirmation process, and achieve the firm\u2019s goal of showing the problem with the block-size limit.\xa0As of this writing, though, exactly how well the test has worked isn\u2019t clear. The block-size fight \u201cis a high-stakes negotiation,\u201d\xa0said bitcoin developer Peter Todd. Costs of processing larger blocks will almost certainly drive out some miners, he said, and leave a smaller pool of players in control. Fewer players means the entire network becomes less about consensus among a broad group, and more about putting trust into a smaller group. \u201cThis is a political PR battle. You can\u2019t make a change to a consensus system without consensus.\u201d To Mark Lamb, the CEO of Coinfloor and one of the myriad people who\u2019ve weighed in online, the debate is ultimately about consensus. \u201cOur position is more about a robust, open debate. We need governance of the protocol to be decentralized and transparent,\u201d he told MoneyBeat. He does think that at some point the block size will need to be increased, but \u201cit\u2019s not about what we do to the block size, it\u2019s about how we do it.\u201d Gavin Andresen is the former lead of the core developer team and the one who has championed the idea of increasing the block size. \u201cScaling up is the number-one thing on my priority list,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get another surge in adoption, and everybody hopes we do, though it\u2019s not guaranteed, then it would be terrible if we got a huge surge, transaction volumes went up and we hit a wall.\u201d The system wouldn\u2019t \u201cexplode,\u201d he explained, but it would mean transactions take longer to confirm. Some might not get confirmed at all. That kind of system would still run, but would likely drive away users, he feels. To him, the issue is solely about accommodating traffic. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m pushing this issue pretty hard.\u201d While most blocks on most days are well below the 1 megabye limit, even a cursory glance at the live blockchain shows block sizes routinely above 900 kilobytes, less than 100 kilobytes from the limit. Coinwallet, which is not a well-known startup and would speak only via email, planned to flood the system with countless small transactions, enough to fill two blocks every minute, they said. After that, they will send out slightly larger transactions, with the goal of creating a 200 megabyte blockchain backlog. With bitcoin averaging ten minutes to confirm a block, that backlog would take more than a day to wade through. \u201cWe feel that our tests might prove to be the catalyst that propels the core devs and miners to implement the required hard fork that is desperately needed,\u201d they wrote. The \u201chard fork\u201d is essentially a software upgrade, which would include the proposed larger block size, that must be adopted by the majority of miners to go into effect. If enough of them band together to reject the change, you could end up with a schism, you could have two blockchains, two immutable officials records that are supposed to stand for all time. It\u2019s like a quarterback controversy in the NFL. If you have two blockchains, you don\u2019t have any blockchains.

Morgan Chase & Co. executive Blythe Masters has acquired two smaller firms and is preparing for its first Series A funding round in the coming months, the firm\u2019s chief executive said Thursday. Ms. Masters said her firm, Digital Asset Holdings, LLC was to acquire San Francisco-based ledger platform HyperLedger and blockchain software company Bits of Proof. Speaking to a room of fintech start-ups and venture capital investors at an event run by Accenture PLC\xa0and economic development group the Partnership Fund for the City of New York, Ms. Masters said that her company would conduct its first Series A funding round in \u201cthe coming months\u201d. Ms. Masters, the former global head of commodities at J.P. Morgan, joined Digital Asset earlier this year. The firm works on distributed ledgers such as blockchain, which is the technology behind the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The New York-based company is focused on\xa0creating real-time, secure settlement using distributed ledgers across a variety of asset classes. Ms. Masters has said the company aims to bridge the gap between Wall Street and the fledgling but fast-developing digital currency world. Ms. Masters told the Fintech event Thursday that her company is working to allow real-time settlement using distributed ledgers. She said: \u201cOur mission at Digital Asset, simply put, is to use that distributed ledger technology to reduce settlement latency, eliminate counterparty risk in the process and improve efficiency along the way.\u201d The firm has proofs of concept \u201cin advanced discussions\u201d with four banks, Ms. Masters said, as well as exchanges, custodians and central counterparties. She said digital ledger technology is \u201ctruly powerful and has the ability to be applied in many, many more use cases than just faster payments\u201d. Digital Asset\u2019s acquisition of HyperLedger might raise eyebrows in the bitcoin community, where there is aversion to the idea that Wall Street might co-opt blockchain technology and strip it of the its decentralized nature. That\u2019s because HyperLedger\u2019s business model is focused on so-called \u201cpermissioned\u201d ledgers, in which the computers charged with updating and authenticating the ledger are appointed and approved by a central authority or association, rather than on \u201cpermissionless\u201d blockchain ledgers open to any \u201cmining\u201d computer eager to earn cryptocurrency. Some have argued that banks will be reluctant to use bitcoin\u2019s decentralized blockchain. They will want to identify and control those who maintain the ledger, these people contend, because they will be nervous about the risk of large, unknown entities taking control of it and undermining its integrity. \u201cHyperledger has some very novel thinking about how to apply the power of blockchain technology without the pitfalls commonly associated with bitcoin,\u201d said John Whelan, CEO of Coinist Inc., which rates assets that are issued on blockchains. \u201cDigital Asset\u2019s acquisition of HyperLedger looks like a clear vote for a next generation of permissioned, blockchain-based, clearing and settling systems.\u201d Investors poured $9.89 billion into US fintech firms in 2014, a sharp rise from the $3.39 billion invested in the sector in 2013, according to a report published by Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City Thursday. The authors of the report highlighted blockchain as an emerging technology expected to see strong growth over the next 18 months, with the big financial institutions working to test it in their trading and banking businesses. Nasdaq, one Wall Street firm embracing the blockchain technology, is pushing forward a plan to integrate it\xa0into its private market, partnering with a San Francisco-based start-up called Chain to issue and transfer shares on Nasdaq\xa0Private Market. The authors of the Accenture report wrote: \u201cWhile payments is still an interesting area for many start-ups, much of the industry has pivoted towards the underlying blockchain technology and its uniquely distributive nature.\u201d The report added: \u201cAlthough much of the blockchain focus has been on front office applications, blockchain, and similar distributed ledger technologies, may soon play a role in the entire life cycle of a trade, including clearing and settlement, collateral management, payments and reconciliation.\u201d A report published earlier this month by consultancy Oliver Wyman, the venture unit of Spanish bank Banco Santander SA\xa0and fintech investment and advisory firm Anthemis Group said that distributed ledger technology like the blockchain could help banks save as much as $20 billion on cross-border payments, compliance and securities trading by 2022. -Additional reporting by Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $244.77, down 0.8% (via CoinDesk) - The fight over bitcoin\u2019s block size is getting testy. Literally.\xa0For months now, a raging debate has been roiling the bitcoin industry over whether or not to increase the maximum size of a transaction block of data. The current maximum is 1 megabyte. Gavin Andresen, who heads up bitcoin\u2019s core developer team, has suggested increasing that to 20 megabytes, so as to facilitate the increased traffic the system is processing as bitcoin grows. That may sound like a dry, technical issue. It is not. It touches upon the cornerstone of the decentralized system \u2013 i.e., how best to compensate the miners who run the network and give them the incentives to keep doing so \u2013 and it illustrates the sometime chaotic nature of building consensus amid a leaderless consortium. The debate was sparked by the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s Gavin Andresen \u2013 who earlier this year proposed increasing the block size \u2013 and is dragging in virtually everybody who has any stake in the system \u2013 developers, cryptographers,\xa0the inchoate, far-flung miners, and entrepreneurs. It has sparked running battles across reddit and Twitter and the bitcoin message boards. On Monday evening New York time, a U.K.-based start-up called coinwallet ran its own \u201cstress test\u201d of the bitcoin network, looking to flood the system with transactions in order to make a point: the systems current constraints are too small to handle increased traffic. \u201cBitcoin is at a breaking point,\u201d they wrote in a post on reddit. \u201cIf nothing is done, bitcoin will never be anything more than a costly science project.\u201d Representatives of coinwallet were not immediately available for comment. The test itself did reach its stated goal of clogging up the system with 200mb worth of transactions, because coinwallet\u2019s servers crashed before they got there. The group said it will run another test in seven days. If the servers don\u2019t crash, we all may learn bitcoin\u2019s real limits. While the initial test took people by surprise, it\u2019s very similar to a test that\xa0Visa Inc. conducts every August of its system. The most recent test, in August 2014, showed the system could handle 56,582 transactions per second (the actual peak volume the previous year was 13,236 transactions per second). The number of transactions on the bitcoin network has been rising steadily, but has not yet bumped up against its limit. That 1 mb limit \u2013 which was put in as an \u201canti-spam\u201d measure -\xa0limits the system to seven transactions per second. On June 18, according to data from Blockchain.info, the system processed 133, 747 transactions \u2013 a record high. But that works out to 5,572 transactions per hour, or 92 transactions per minute, or 1.5 transactions per second. So the system isn\u2019t at the breaking point yet, but that\u2019s no reason to wait until it is. Changing the block size is technically simple. It requires rewriting the bitcoin code. But that change has to be accepted by consensus, because it requires the majority of miners adopted the updated software. If they didn\u2019t, you\u2019d have two different versions of bitcoin running. But changing the block-size limit alters the incentive system for mining, and here\u2019s where the fight heats up. A larger block-size limit \u2013 which could capture more transactions to be processed in one batch \u2013 raises the odds that a miner building a bigger block will lose out to one building a smaller block in the race to win the 25 bitcoin the system releases roughly every 10 minutes. That could raise the costs of running a mining operation and lower the profit. Miners who have built a business around the system\u2019s current parameters are, therefore, reluctant to agree to any changes. Ideally, supply and demand dynamics will sort out the incentive structure, no matter the block size (Mr. Andresen wrote about that here). The trick is getting the current crop of miners to agree to that, even if it goes against their interests in the short term.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$251.37, up 5.9% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013In the constant search for the killer app that boosts the mainstream appeal of digital currency, the idea of leveraging social media has some fans. Into this field steps Reveal, a mobile-only startup looking to be the next big social network, which plans on issuing its own currency to encourage network expansion.\xa0On Tuesday, it announced a $1.5 million seed funding round from investors including Mike Hirshland of Resolute Ventures, Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group and \xa0Adam Draper of Boost VC. On the content side, Reveal isn\u2019t exactly aiming for highbrow tastes. It will encourage users to post questions in text and have members respond with often-goofy, 15-second video posts. (One question currently on the beta app asks \u201cWhat\u2019s your five year plan?\u201d to which a young woman responds on video, \u201cDon\u2019t die, and don\u2019t become homeless. That\u2019s my five-year plan.\u201d) It\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the background that makes it interesting, at least for those of us with an interest in digital currencies. Founding \xa0members who join the network within the first year will be awarded 1,000 Reveal Coins, a proprietary currency denoted as RVL. They\u2019ll also earn 10,000 RVL for every friend who joins using a special referral code and a further 100 RVL for every \u201clike\u201d that their posts receive. And here\u2019s the interesting part: any advertiser that wants to place an ad with Reveal can only do so by first acquiring those coins, including from members. Advertisers will pay for the coins in dollars on an exchange that will be set up on the app. It\u2019s a unique way to achieve the revenue-sharing objective that other social media sites are aiming for \u2013 including Latin America\u2019s Taringa, which rewards providers of popular content with bitcoin \u2013 and in doing so create an incentive for members to expand the network itself and so increase its appeal for advertisers. A positive feedback loop \u2013 at least that\u2019s the goal. Reveal\u2019s managers will keep a minimum of 75% of coins for themselves. But, citing the example of Instagram\u2019s valuation, co-founder and CEO Matt Ivester\xa0says that still suggests there\u2019s a big profit opportunity for members if the ad dollars come in. He adds that a finite number of Reveal coin will be produced and that advertisers will \u201cburn\u201d their coins when they buy ads, effectively removing them from circulation in a way that constrains supply and increases the value of the remaining coins. If Instagram had followed this model, Mr. Ivester says, his team estimates that each coin would now be worth between $1.60 and $2.00. To be clear, this is not a decentralized currency like bitcoin. That will surely cause some of the purists in the cryptocurrency community to raise concerns about transparency and control. What\u2019s to stop the founders from manipulating the issuance to their benefit? To that, co-founder and CTO Josh Beal replies, \u201cIn the same way that bitcoin mining pools have a vested interest in avoiding a 51% attack, we have a vested interest in making Reveal Coin a secure and fair system, since it increases the value of the network for both us and our users.\u201d\xa0\xa0(Michael J. Casey) \u2013As interest has grown toward adopting blockchain technology to streamline various functions of the financial sector, one firm in particular has been especially aggressive in acting as a consultant to financial\xa0institutions: blockchain-solutions designer Chain. Today it announced that it\u2019s working with another financial firm, payment processor First Data, to create a decentralized system for keeping track of balances on merchant gift cards. The driver of this latter initiative is Vinny Lingham, the CEO and founder of Gyft, which First Data acquired last year. Gyft\u2019s app allows users to upload different gift cards onto a single mobile platform. It was early recipient of bitcoin payments for its cards. According to Mr. Lingham, the existing gift card industry relies on \u201cdozens if not hundreds of payment processors to process the payments, lots of small companies that act as intermediaries to make sure the ledger is correct\u201d Now, he hopes to transfer that ledger-keeping role to the transparently operated \xa0and decentralized bitcoin blockchain to ensure that merchants and customers are no longer \u201chostage\u201d to these processors. That way Mr. Lingham says, costs can be cut from the system and individuals and merchants can keep track of balances in a transparent way. It should also facilitate trading of \u201cWe want to revolutionize the industry,\u201d Mr. Lingham says. \u201cLet\u2019s understand what a gift card is: it\u2019s a contract between a merchant and a customer. All that information and that contract should be automated and stored on the blockchain so that we know what\u2019s going onto and off the gift card.\u201d Mr. Lingham says the gift card industry in the U.S. is currently worth $50 billion in revenue and growing rapidly because merchants prefer the control and lower fees of having their customers pay them through a closed-loop system rather than the open loops run by credit card providers such as Mastercard and Visa. Meanwhile, Chain is busy working with various other financial institutions, including credit card companies and banks, to develop blockchain solutions for their businesses. \u201cI\u2019m yet to talk to a financial services company where they haven\u2019t already started working on understanding and figuring how they can build a pilot around a blockchain implementation,\u201d says Chain CEO Adam Ludwin.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $229.90 ,up 0.4% (via CoinDesk) - A start-up called OB1 that is building a new online commerce platform, OpenBazaar, announced on Thursday that it had raised $1 million in funding from two notable venture-capital firms, Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as angel investor\xa0William Mougayar. Normally, a start-up raising such a relatively small amount of money wouldn\u2019t attract much attention. But OpenBazaar is intriguing. It\u2019s using two key technologies, file-sharing software and bitcoin, to produce a sort of decentralized eBay, where buyers and sellers will interact directly and private data will be kept private. The platform works using BitTorrent file-sharing software and bitcoin to create a decentralized network of buyers and sellers. There is no middle-man, and no user fees. It is completely open. The platform was first conceived in a 2014 hackathon, when it went by the more ominous moniker of DarkMarket,\xa0and the firm plans to launch it publicly later this year. Initially, the group of engineers building OpenBazaar were operating as a loose collective building the software on the open-source platform GitHub. But they were frustrated with the slow pace, according to OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman, and after several months of looking at alternatives, they settled on a plan that included incorporating. The money will go mainly toward engineering support, Mr. Hoffman said. The team is small, only six people, and they expect to keep it that way. If OpenBazaar works, it could open a new can of worms. While software is amoral, of course, this platform could be used as an even more powerful Silk Road-type marketplace, one without any central point of control. It\u2019s a question that the developers get every time they talk about the project, Mr. Hoffman acknowledged. Their response is that OpenBazaar itself is just software, it\u2019s \u201cagnostic.\u201d The users themselves will determine what gets sold there. \u201cIt\u2019s what comes with the territory,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin has the same problem.\u201d In place of an operator like eBay that can stand in as the third party and guarantee contracts and mediate disputes, OpenBazaar will rely upon an arbitration process among its users, and a reputation points system for users who offer up their services as arbiters. Two of the three involved parties would need to agree to a decision for it to become binding. Whether OpenBazaar becomes a new kind of eBay or Alibaba, or a new kind of Silk Road, is a question that will have ramifications. One thing the three have in common is that they are \u2013 or were, in Silk Road\u2019s case \u2013 centrally controlled platforms. It was that aspect of Silk Road that allowed the FBI to eventually track down, arrest and prosecute the site\u2019s operator, Ross Ulbricht. OpenBazaar, by contrast, will not be centrally controlled. OB1 isn\u2019t running it, the firm is just making software. The commerce isn\u2019t overseen by anybody. Mr. Hoffman said he hasn\u2019t been contacted by any regulators.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$228.95, up 2.49% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013After eight months developing its much-anticipated \u201csidechains\u201d project, which aims to turn bitcoin\u2019s technology into a more versatile platform \xa0for innovative decentralizing applications, the cryptography team at Blockstream has unveiled its first prototype sidechain. The \u201cSidechain Elements\u201d software contains various features that could be appealing to institutions wanting to leverage bitcoin\u2019s decentralized, peer-to-peer network in new, middleman-free business models. In particular, it includes applications that could help startups disrupt certain Wall Street processes. The next step is opening the code up for outside developers to review, critique and tinker with. \u201cWe are now \xa0inviting the technical community\u2026to join in and participate and try out and comment on, and actually suggest changes or improvements,\u201d said company president Adam Back, noting that chief technology officer Gregory Maxwell will discuss the details with bitcoin developers at\xa0a San Francisco meeting at 7 p.m. PDT (10 p.m. EDT) later Monday. Mr. Back, who is best known for inventing the hashcash anti-spam system on which key parts of bitcoin\u2019s software is based, formed Blockstream last year to bring his sidechains idea to fruition. In doing so, he joined forces with CEO Austin Hill, a veteran of cryptography-based privacy system startups and co-founders such as Mr. Maxwell and Pieter Wuille, two of the five-person core development team charged with managing bitcoin\u2019s underlying software. Their combined bitcoin coding pedigree helped Blockstream raise $21 million from many prominent Silicon Valley investors, led by LinkedIn Corp. founder and Greylock Partners venture capitalist Reid Hoffman. Since announcing that fundraising in November, the sidechains idea has attracted much attention in the bitcoin community because it could get around the \xa0fundamental problem that to make key, innovative changes to bitcoin\u2019s code requires agreement from the many miners that manage the network. Because of the value attached to their bitcoin holdings, there is often a natural resistance to embrace untested changes. A sidechain functions as a separately managed ledger, with its own software code and independent transactions, that is \u201cpegged\u201d to the main bitcoin blockchain ledger so as to allow bitcoins to be transferred from one chain to the other. In theory, that structure allows users of a sidechain ledger \u2013 buyers and sellers of some digitized asset that trades on that ledger, for example, or people registering ownership of property deeds \u2013 to indirectly tap the underlying authenticating power of bitcoin\u2019s transaction-processing mining network while simultaneously taking advantage of a more flexible software platform. As the first iteration of that, Sidechain Elements includes enhancements to confidentiality. Right now, IP addresses running the nominally anonymous, alphanumeric codes that represent bitcoin addresses can be discovered by sophisticated analysis of large transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, Mr. Back said. Sidechain Elements addresses that by making it much harder to gauge how much money is going from address to address and thus harder to identify their owners even though the network can still verify that all balances are in equilibrium. Enhanced transactions confidentiality could be useful for Wall Street-focused businesses such as Digital Asset Holdings, a New York-based startup that\u2019s developing blockchain-based solutions for post-trade securities settlement. DAH Chief Technology Officer Shaul Kfir said it could be a \u201cvery powerful way to protect investors from having to disclose sensitive business information, even while providing complete transparency to regulators.\u201d \u201cComputer security is at a pretty abysmal point,\u201d Mr. Kfir said. \u201cYou really want it to so that when any data is moving through the transactional layer it is as secure as possible, as encrypted as possible.\u201d He said Blockstream\u2019s confidentiality element goes \u201c99% of the way\u201d toward achieving those goals. Other Sidechain Elements features of potential value to Wall Street-focused firms include an asset issuance tool that allows users to create their own tokens representing currencies, bonds, shares or various other asset classes. It also contains a special timing feature that provides more flexibility for services such one called Lightning that aggregate transactions in an \u201coff-chain\u201d setting before implementing them on the blockchain, a process that could significantly expand bitcoin\u2019s scalability .Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $227.21, up 0.7% (via CoinDesk) - The BitLicense is here, whether you like it or not (and some clearly do not).\xa0Regardless of where you stand on the issue, however, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that this is merely the first step in what\u2019s sure to be a very long dance between regulators and bitcoiners.  Benjamin Lawsky, the outgoing superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, unveiled the final proposal for the agency\u2019s BitLicense, a regulatory framework for digital-currency businesses operating in the state. It will be published in the state register in the next few weeks, at which point it becomes law. While it was first unveiled more than a year ago, and has gone through two full rounds of public comment, it still drew at least one swift criticism. \u201cThe language we see here is improved from the original proposal. Yet the final BitLicense is far from perfect,\u201d said Jerry Brito, the executive director of the advocacy group Coin Center, in a press release. The DFS chose a tough task for itself, trying to balance out the risks and rewards of a new technology, of holding bitcoin companies to standards that balance innovation and the need to protect the public at large. \u201cGenerally speaking, consumer protection rules exist for good reason,\u201d Mr. Lawsky said in prepared remarks at the conference in Washington where he unveiled the new version (you can read the BitLicense itself here). \u201cAnd to the extent that they need to be updated, regulators should move quickly, but carefully, to do so.\u201d On the other hand, he said he understands that change is coming to financial services, and indeed is needed. \u201cIn an age of smart phones and on-demand technology, we still have a disco-era payments system,\u201d he said. Ultimately, though \u2013 and it pains us to say this \u2013 New York is not the center of the universe. It\u2019s one region, one state in one nation. Regulators from New York to Sacramento to London to Bern and Singapore are going to have to develop their own regulations, and bitcoin businesses are going to have to weigh regulatory regimes as one option. Some, like Xapo, are going to move. Others, like ItBit, may come up with a completely novel way to get regulated. In any case, the BitLicense represents the beginning, not the end, of this process, something Mr. Lawsky himself acknowledged. (Paul Vigna) - As the regulatory front evolves, the business models are evolving as well. Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange that ranks as one of the largest exchanges, unveiled a feature on Wednesday aimed at increasing the transparency into its holdings. The firm is now offering individual multi-sig wallets through a partnership with BitGo that will provide segregated customer accounts, a \u201cproof of reserves\u201d concept that aims to provide complete visibility into customer holdings. Essentially, between the multi-sig protection and the segregated accounts, customers will have complete control over their money. In the traditional capital markets, investors go through brokers to make trades, who then go to the exchanges. That doesn\u2019t exist, yet, for bitcoin, so investors must go directly to the exchanges. Generally speaking, bitcoin exchanges like Bitfinex hold the customer money one account, even if it\u2019s an offline, \u201ccold storage\u201d account. This new service changes that model. \u201cThe era of pooled wallets is over,\u201d BitGo CEO Mike Belshe told MoneyBeat. The new accounts will sit individually on bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, meaning investors can verify on their own their balances. Assuming this kind of transparency is widely adopted, it would pull bitcoin exchanges away from the notorious Mt. Gox model, he noted, and nudge them toward more traditional models. \u201cAll of us in the bitcoin ecosystem realized that in order for bitcoin to succeed, we need the security to be unquestioned.\u201d \u201cIt allows traders to rest assured that their funds aren\u2019t being used nefariously,\u201d said Zane Tackett, Bitfinex\u2019s director of community and product development. Should it work as advertised, it would also the exchange hopes give larger investors the confidence to trade in the digital world. \u201cWe hope the rest of the industry implements similar setups,\u201d Mr. Tackett said.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $226.00, up 1.2% (via CoinDesk) - One half of BitBeat spent last week moderating discussions at the inaugural Blockchain Summit on Richard Branson\u2019s Caribbean island, Necker Island. It was perhaps inevitable that an exclusive event in a tropical idyll, where businessmen hobnob in the presence of one of the world\u2019s richest men, would elicit allegations of elitism from some of quarters of the bitcoin community (as well as the occasional conspiracy theory.) But as the summit progressed, it became clear that the attendees had grander and, arguably, more altruistic aspirations than their critics imagined. The group, which the summit web site described as comprising \u201cthe greatest minds in digital innovation,\u201d explored multiple projects that would use the blockchain \u2013 the core ledger technology underlying bitcoin \u2013 to change the lives of billions of people. Whether these succeed remains to be seen, but the scope of the goals discussed was striking. Venture capitalist and co-organizer Bill Tai says he\u2019d used as his model the Stanford University Homebrew Computer Club, which helped make home computing a reality in the 1970s after engaging the likes of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and early Apple developer Steve Wosniak. Mr. Tai, whose events company Mai Tai Global co-hosted the event along with bitcoin mining company BitFury, said he wanted the close-knit arrangement and relaxed environment of Necker Island to \u201ccreate a way for people to let go and really collaborate.\u201d A decent amount of non-tech expertise was on hand, reflecting a view that to succeed with real-world implementations, blockchain-based innovations need people with understanding of political, social and cultural realities. Peruvian economist and anti-poverty crusader Hernando de Soto gave presentations on the challenges of titling property for the poor in developing countries, for example, and social media maven Oliver Luckett spoke of how viral content on social media tends to follow patterns found in biology. \u201cWhen\xa0accomplished\xa0people with diverse background can be placed in an unstructured environment where barriers are stripped away, the interaction that occurs allows the spontaneous and serendipitous mixing of ideas that can reformulate themselves into amazing action plans,\u201d Mr. Tai said. As Mr. de Soto explained how people\u2019s property rights in mineral-rich parts of Peru get diluted into communal landholdings and then transferred without adequate compensation to multinational mining companies via a process that he described as an \u201cartisanal blockchain,\u201d attendees hatched plans to inscribe such individuals\u2019 assets into the high-tech, digital-currency blockchain. The idea is that the indelible, public ledger would permanently legitimize these peoples\u2019 personal claims and empower them with a provable deed, a form of legal collateral with which to raise money, take out insurance or, if the bid is high enough, sell their plot of land. The concept fits within the \u201csocial impact\u201d goals that Brian Forde told the group were key elements of MIT Media Lab\u2019s new Digital Currency Initiative, of which Mr. Forde, a former White House adviser, is the director. The same goes for a project described by entrepreneur John Edge, who spoke of his \u201cID 2020\u2033 project, working with international child welfare agencies to create a global, blockchain-based record of digitized birth certificates that help protect children from human-traffickers. Enhancing his pitch: a live Skype video address on the last evening of the summit from actress Lucy Liu, who has directed documentaries on child prostitution to draw attention to the plight of unidentified children. Tied to this digital ID idea and to a host of other applications for blockchain technology was the briefing from Patrick Deegan, the Chief Technology Officer of Personal Black Box, on the Open Mustard Seed protocol, a software program of which he is the chief architect and which aims to empower people to develop their own \u201cself-sovereign\u201d digital identities. Meanwhile, consultant Paul Brody of Ernst Young spoke of his work at former employer IBM to develop a blockchain-based framework for automated devices and appliances to securely transact with each other in the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d of the future. The summit got a glimpse of this interconnected \u201cIoT\u201d world from Bitfury, which demonstrated a light bulb containing a special chip designed to mine bitcoins. Such a device could never compete with the super-fast specialized mining machines that firms like BitFury deploy in high-tech, climate-controlled data centers to process transactions and earn bitcoins in return. After all, the company this week rolled out new 28-namometer mining chips that Vice Chairman George Kikvadze says are three times more efficient than the prior generation and predicts these will give the company \u201csignificant market share\u201d in this increasingly industrialized industry. Still, making money isn\u2019t the point of the light bulb. According to designer Niko Punin, BitFury created it to show what\u2019s possible and use it as an intriguing way to promote the adoption of bitcoin. (Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $237.17, down 0.1% (via CoinDesk) - \u201cEverybody gasped,\u201d Alex Winter said, speaking to MoneyBeat by cellphone outside the courthouse where Ross Ulbricht had just been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Mr. Winter, whose documentary on Mr. Ulbricht, \u201cDeep Web,\u201d premieres this weekend, was in the courtroom to witness the final scene of a story he\u2019s has spent two years working on. Mr. Ulbricht was convicted in February of being the mastermind behind the Silk Road, an online drug website that utilized bitcoin as its currency. Mr. Ulbricht was fingered as the site\u2019s creator, who went by the moniker \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d online. He has maintained his innocence, and his lawyers have already said they plan to appeal Friday\u2019s sentence, as well as the earlier conviction. \u201cIt\u2019s not just life,\u201d\xa0Mr. Winter said, then reconsidered that. \u201cWell, it is just life. It\u2019s his whole life.\u201d The sentence didn\u2019t just shock the people in the courtroom. Nobody with whom Mr. Winter spoke had expected such a harsh sentence. \u201cIt was a very powerful thing emotionally to witness.\u201d The sentencing wasn\u2019t a dry courtroom proceeding. For three hours, the two sides had an emotional debate on what Mr. Winter called the \u201cthe idealism of privacy and anonymity\u201d and the government\u2019s response to that. Mr. Ulbricht \u2013 who says he created the site but sold if after a few months \u2013 has said he created it in the interest of fostering privacy and believed if people weren\u2019t harming others they should have the right to buy or sell whatever they wanted. The government countered forcefully, bringing forth the parents of one man who died after buying drugs on the Silk Road, an example of the harm the site did do. Cameras weren\u2019t allowed in the courtroom, of course, but Mr. Winter said if they were, he could have made a film of just those three hours. \u201cIt was incredibly dramatic,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not expecting it at all. It was very intense.\u201d Mr. Winter \u2013 who directed a 2013 documentary called \u201cDownloaded\u201d about Napster and file sharing \u2013 said he wasn\u2019t trying to make a movie about Mr. Ulbricht specifically. He was looking to make a film about the Silk Road as seen from the inside, and while being very upfront about the fact that it was criminal enterprise, he still said he felt empathy if not sympathy for Mr. Ulbricht. \u201cHonestly, I feel really sad,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel emotionally and completely drained.\u201d \u201cDeep Web\u201d makes its debut on Sunday night on the cable channel Epix, but Friday\u2019s courtroom scene won\u2019t be part of it. Mr. Winter said he plans one graphics card change at the end, explaining the sentencing, but otherwise the film won\u2019t be altered because it\u2019s already been finished.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$233.99, up 0.88% (via\xa0CoinDesk) -Ask people on the street what they think of Gavin Andresen\u2019s proposal to raise bitcoin\u2019s block size limit and you\u2019ll almost certainly get a nonplussed look. But inside bitcoinland, the lead developer\u2019s plan to alter the data capacity for the 10-minute batches of transactions that form the digital currency\u2019s core blockchain ledger is as hotly contested as any it has seen. And this a community accustomed to contentious debates. And for once the issue really matters \u2013 especially now that Wall Street firms like Nasdaq OMX are talking about using the blockchain for digitized asset transfers.\xa0Adding a host of non-currency applications could fill up the system\u2019s transaction-processing capacity. In short, the block size debate may be a do-or-die test of the bitcoin community\u2019s capacity to govern itself. As the number of bitcoin-based transactions increases it will eventually run up against the current 1MB block size limit, ensuring that some payments will be excluded by the \u201cminers\u201d that run bitcoin\u2019s computer network. Those unconfirmed currency transfers could just be left in limbo. If the block size isn\u2019t increased, users will voluntarily add fee payments to their transactions to entice miners into including them in their batches instead of others with lesser fees. Under this market solution, fees will eventually reach \u201cthe point where only rich people can transact,\u201d Mr. Andresen warns. So much for bitcoin as a \u201cmicropayments\u201d solution. Mr. Andresen\u2019s five-member team of core developers could easily rewrite the code. The problem is that any core update to bitcoin\u2019s code must be adopted by the mining community; if miners don\u2019t like the change, they will simply ignore the new \u201chard fork\u201d in the software and keep working on the original version of the blockchain ledger. Hence \xa0Mr. Andresen\u2019s campaign to convince miners to go along with his plan. The dispute mostly comes down to economics. Miners, at least in the short-term, want higher fees and less work \u2013 which means many will want to resist the block size increase. But bitcoin\u2019s value will, in theory, be enhanced by an expansion in the network of users; anything that holds that back \u2013 such as insufficiently large blocks \u2014 will hold back the price of bitcoin and limit the upside for everyone. It\u2019s more than just a matter of trading short-term gain for long-term return, however. Miners have differing priorities \u2013 larger mining operations with economies of scale are better placed to benefit from greater volumes with lower fees than smaller operators. Then, there\u2019s the debate over security. Bitcoin developer Peter Todd leads a group who worry that the network\u2019s security will be compromised if bigger block sizes and lower fees disincentive miners to perform their vital role as transaction verifiers. On the other side, David Hudson at data-monitoring service hashingit.com bitcoin points out that merely approaching full block size will cause the bitcoin network to effectively become dysfunctional. And core developer Mike Hearn has argued that an ever increasing wait time for excluded transactionswould quickly lead to a bitcoin-wide collapse. Some, such as the founders of the Lightning Network, tout\xa0temporary \u201coff-chain\u201d solutions\xa0so that micro-transactions (and their fees) can be pooled before entering the blockchain with more collective clout. Others, such as the team at BlockCypher, insist that operating \u201con-chain\u201d in the decentralized blockchain is the only transparent way\xa0to process transactions and instead promote tools for setting less discriminatory fees and increasing the chances that a micro-transaction will be confirmed. All this debate has drawn attention to the limits of the bitcoin community\u2019s loose, decentralized structure for agreeing on contentious \xa0overhauls to its core software infrastructure. Calling this a \u201ccrossroads\u201d moment that exposes bitcoin\u2019s \u201cseriously inadequate\u201d governance model, \xa0Princeton assistant professor Arvind Narayanan has laid out three suggestions: the creation of a technical advisory board, a transparent polling mechanism and public comment process, and a better defined mechanism for reaching consensus rather than just trading volleys of criticism. Separately, Brian Forde, director of the newly formed MIT Digital Currency Initiative, is offering to co-host an open forum for discussions aimed arriving at a \u201crough consensus.\u201d \u201cHow this decision is made will be a good example of how the open and active community of developers, entrepreneurs, miners, researchers and users will continue to collaborate on major changes to Bitcoin core,\u201d Mr. Forde says. Meanwhile, the clock on block-size limits is ticking.

We now know the Silicon Valley firm will be making embeddable chips capable of turning your smartphone or TV into a quiet miner of bitcoins. (For the uninitiated, mining refers to the collective activity of confirming transactions and updating bitcoin\u2019s core \u201cblockchain\u201d ledger, all of which is performed by thousands of independent computers in return for rewards in the digital currency.) But will it work? 21\u2019s plan hinges on a paradigm shift: A future \u201cInternet of Things\u201d in which tens of millions of smart devices and appliances will tap into a stream of small \u201cSatoshi\u201d bitcoin rewards to facilitate micropayments and build new, dynamic networks of interconnectivity. \xa0Founder and\xa0CEO Balaji Srinivasan envisages a world in which bitcoin is \u201ca fundamental system resource on par with CPU, bandwidth, hard drive space and RAM.\u201d If you believe that world is coming and, by extension,\xa0that\xa0both the usage and value of bitcoin will soar, 21\u2032s plan could be the play of the century. But the recent history of bitcoin mining, where a falling bitcoin price and an arms race among developers of specialized mining chips,\xa0has left many with big doubts. Tim Swanson, a consistently skeptical digital-currency consultant who makes a habit of challenging bitcoiners\u2019 unbridled optimism, is unequivocal. 21\u2032s plan is \u201ca dumb idea,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cthe investors deserve to get what\u2019s coming to them.\u201d Mr. Swanson\u2019s complaint: that 21\u2032s chips can\u2019t upgrade their hashing, or raw computing, power and so won\u2019t keep up with the rising \u201cdifficulty\u201d rates that bitcoin\u2019s software sets in response to increases in the network\u2019s overall hashing power. (The algorithm does this to ensure that faster machines don\u2019t complete their work too quickly and so trigger an undesirable acceleration in the release of bitcoins beyond the core algorithm\u2019s current schedule of 25 coins every 10 minutes.) The static hashing power in 21\u2019s bitcoin-enabled devices will doom them to a spiral of ever-falling competitiveness, which means they will \u201cprobably very quickly\u201d be left with proceeds that are worth no more than small \u201cdust\u201d amounts of bitcoin, Mr. Swanson said. It will be difficult \u2013 because of bitcoin\u2019s anti-spam protections \u2013 for 21 to distribute these essentially worthless winnings to the thousands of device users, he added, arguing that the company would in effect have to become a bank. In response, a company spokeswoman said such criticism unreasonably assumed that the dollar price of bitcoin wouldn\u2019t rise to offset the shrinking digital-currency payouts even though the network effects of its mass-adoption project should spur greater demand for bitcoin. \u201cYou\u2019d have to believe that 100 million new devices could be generating bitcoin continuously without any impact on the utility \u2013 hence on the price \u2014 for bitcoin,\u201d she said. The spokeswoman cited how the price had soared from one cent a few years ago to around $230 now, even though the network hashing power and difficulty adjustment have also ratcheted much higher. Still, recent history will feed skepticism among seasoned bitcoin miners. As the price fell from above $1,100 in early December 2013, small, independent miners struggled to profitably compete with large, datacenter-based operators as their machines rapidly became obsolete and electricity costs rose. Inevitably, people are asking how their already power-starved devices will handle this new, power-hungry task: @bitcoininfo @WSJD @mikejcasey Great, so now my cell phone battery will die even faster. \u2014 Michael Mulgrew (@mike_stang) May 18, 2015 Here too, the 21 spokeswoman had a retort (and hinted at thinking beyond smartphones): \u201cFirst, our chips approach the theoretical limits of what it is possible to do with existing semiconductor technology in terms of power efficiency \u2014 we literally have PhDs in EE on staff who wrote their theses on this exact topic.\u201d Second, she said, users will choose between chips of different power consumption efficiencies depending on their particular device\u2019s size, cost and purpose. There would be low-end chips for cellphones, for example, or high-end chips for servers. In the end, the spokeswoman said, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to see whether systems designers and consumers believe that trading a small amount of power for an infinite stream of built-in bitcoin is a useful design tradeoff.\u201d Whether 21\u2032s end market lies with ordinary consumers or with businesses running powerful server farms, the prominent Silicon Valley names who\u2019ve sunk more than $116 million into it are betting this tradeoff will eventually seem worth it. In effect, they are betting on a very different future.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $233.18, up 0.1% (via CoinDesk) - Wall Street\u2019s bitcoin dalliance continues to get more serious.\xa0On Monday, the New York Stock Exchange launched a bitcoin index, a move that ties the\xa0upstart digital currency to the very seat of American-style capitalism. We can imagine how the cryptoanarchists feel about that. The index has a lot of company, but it seems the gravitas of the NYSE should give it immediate relevance. The index, formally called the NYSE Bitcoin Index (NYXBT), is the first index produced by a major exchange. Bloomberg has been providing bitcoin prices quotes for more than a year now, and various bitcoin exchanges provide their own quotes, as well as news sites like CoinDesk. The NYSE is known best for its exchange, but it is also a huge publisher of indexes. With this bitcoin index, it\u2019s looking to extend its business and reputation into an emerging asset. \u201cWe want to be that trusted source\u201d for prices, NYSE President Tom Farley told MoneyBeat. The decision to build a bitcoin index was both a reaction to the existing market and anticipation of its growth, he said. \u201cI think it has the potential to be an important asset class.\u201d This is the NYSE\u2019s second foray into the bitcoin waters. In January, it was part of a group that invested $75 million in bitcoin-services firm Coinbase, and the NYSE\u2019s index will initially rely upon data from Coinbase. It expects to add other exchanges as it certifies them. Coinbase launched its exchange in January, and is currently the sixth busiest in terms of trading volume, according to data from TradeBlock. This is another step in the development and maturation of the bitcoin marketplace, which includes trading products based on bitcoin \u2013 like the Digital Currency Group\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust \xa0and the forthcoming ETF from the Winklevoss twins, as well as various derivatives products, such as swaps, that are now available on independent exchanges. Since an initial drop at the beginning of 2015, the price of bitcoin has been \u2013 in relative terms -\xa0incredibly stable. Since sinking as low as $177 on Jan. 14, it\u2019s been trading reliably in a channel between $200 and $250. \u2013Ripple Labs Inc. has finalized its Series A funding effort with a $28 million haul.\xa0We\u2019d reported in January that the digital currency payments processing company was close to wrapping up a new investment \xa0round worth $30 million; in the end the total was slightly less than that, it took a little longer to finalize than was anticipated, and two of the reported investors aren\u2019t on the final list. Nonetheless, the news offers a sign that Ripple is moving forward following the company\u2019s $700,000 settlement agreement earlier this month over compliance breaches. As with other recent funding announcements from bitcoin startups, the round is distinguished by the inclusion of firms outside of the traditional venture capital sector. In this case, it involved the venture arms of\xa0\xa0global data storage company Seagate Technology PLC \xa0and exchange manager the CME Group  Inc. (yet another Wall Street-connected institution finding its way into digital currencies.) The new funding arrangement has also given a stronger presence to existing investor IDG Capital Partners, a prominent Chinese venture capital firm that\u2019s known for having taken early stakes in some its country\u2019s biggest Internet stars, including Baidu, Tencent and Xiaomi. IDG Partner Li Feng will now join Ripple\u2019s Board of Directors. This follows news last month that IDG had co-led (along with Goldman Sachs Group) a $50 million investment round for bitcoin firm Circle Internet Financial. As with Circle, Ripple\u2019s deeper engagement with a well-connected Chinese investors is tied closely to ambitions to develop ties with China\u2019s potentially deep market for financial transactions. Absent from the Ripple announcement were the names of Silicon Valley venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures, both early investors in Ripple. Officials from the two firms and from Ripple were not immediately available for comment. (Michael Casey) UPDATE: An earlier version of this post listed Ripple\u2019s funding as $30 million.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $xx, up/down xx% (via CoinDesk) PLEASE UPDATE PRICE - ItBit, a New York-based digital-currency exchange, opened its doors on Thursday to U.S. customers as a trust company.\xa0The 18-month old startup announced that it has received a trust company charter from\xa0\xa0the New York State Department of Financial Services that will allow it to operate in all 50 states as a fully regulated financial-services entity. That was only one of the things the company announced. ItBit also closed on a $25 million funding round, bringing its total capital raising to $32 million, and\xa0named several notable people to its board of directors, including former FDIC chairman Sheila Bair and former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley. Taken collectively, the moves signal the start-up\u2019s intentions to be a mainstream commercial business, and a mainstream option for investors in the capital markets. It\u2019s also the latest in a series of moves that are meshing together the worlds of bitcoin and Wall Street. \u201cOur focus has been to create an institutional-grade exchange,\u201d Charles Cascarilla, itBit\u2019s co-founder and CEO, told MoneyBeat, to differentiate itself from the unregulated, Wild West kinds of bitcoin companies that have scared off investors and the Street. ItBit was founded in Singapore, another banking capital, but moved to New York last year.The firm started the application process for the trust charter 15 months ago, before it even moved its offices to New York last July. Going the trust route is a novel play. Most start-ups go through the process of getting money-transmitter licenses, which is a state-by-state process. With the trust charter, Mr. Cascarilla said, \u201cyou\u2019re stepping into a much higher standard of oversight and requirements, which reassures the traditional system.\u201d That\u2019s key, he said, because the firm\u2019s goal is to attract commercial institutions and the professional investing class.\xa0\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the best bitcoin company,\u201d he said, \u201cwe want to be the best bitcoin company in financial services.\u201d It\u2019s also a notable advance for the bitcoin capital market. The number of trading platforms and products are increasing, and the opportunities for trading are far wider than they were just two years ago, when the majority of bitcoin trading was going through Mt. Gox\u2019s rickety structure. Today there are a number of exchanges around the globe, and investors can buy swaps and derivatives, and make leveraged bets; there is one bitcoin ETF on the market, from Barry Silbert\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust, with another coming soon from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss \u2013 who are also running their own exchange, called Gemini. All of this is building a base for bitcoin trading that positions the nascent market \u2013 and the promulgators of these products hope potential customers will see it this way \u2013 as a mainstream investment, something your advisor in the family office might recommend. That\u2019s the plan, at least. What will be interesting now will be to watch and see if all these moves convince investors that bitcoin and digital currencies are really past their Wild West phase. The trust company charter allows itBit to begin taking U.S. deposits that will be fully insured and fully compliant with standard regulations. In essence, itBit will be acting as any other trust company, with the only difference being that its focus is on digital currencies. It\u2019s an approach that is different from other bitcoin startups; itBit will be acting as a regulated fiduciary, responsible for holding its clients assets under the same rules that govern State Street and Rockefeller Trust Co. Mr. Cascarilla was careful to point out, though, that it won\u2019t be acting as a full-bore bank. \u201cWe won\u2019t be making car loans.\u201d The company also announced an expansion of its board of directors to five, with three new members: Ms. Bair, Sen. Bradley, and Robert Herz, a former chairman of the\xa0Financial Accounting Standards Board and a senior partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Series A fund-raising round included previous investors RRE Ventures,\xa0Liberty City Ventures and Jay W. Jordan II; among the new investors are Raptor Capital Management chairman James Pallotta. Sen. Bradley was well known among his New Jersey constituents for going down the shore every summer and walking on the beach to meet and spend time with the regular folk. We wonder if he\u2019ll do the same this summer, maybe handing out bitcoin as well as shaking hands.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$230.47, down 2.57% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013If there\u2019s one eye-catching clause in the settlement that Ripple Labs signed with U.S. financial regulators over compliance breaches, it\u2019s the agreement to make \u201cenhancements to the Ripple protocol\u201d to allow monitoring of counterparties that use the core software program on which the Ripple payments network runs. This got the bitcoin community up in arms. How could the government seek to force changes to an open-source software platform that\u2019s supposed to be free from any party\u2019s centralized control? Could it feasibly apply to other digital currencies \u2013 including bitcoin, whose governance structure has no go-to management actor like Ripple Labs? How will users react to the notion that Ripple is snooping on them even if the company is not itself a counterparty to their trades? When we put these concerns to Ripple Labs\u2019 new Bank Secrecy Act officer, Antoinette O\u2019Gorman, she suggested there was a misunderstanding and that \u201cenhancements to Ripple protocol\u201d was an imperfect choice of wording in the agreement struck with the U.S. Financial CrimesEnforcement Network. \xa0All that Ripple had agreed to, she said, was to build enhanced\xa0\u201canalytical transaction monitoring tools for monitoring transactions across the protocol\u201d and to furnish information drawn from that monitoring to U.S. authorities upon request. The changes had \u201cnothing to do with the protocol itself,\u201d she said. These monitoring tools are secondary applications that anyone could have built to analyze the flow of data across the publicly transparent ledger of Ripple transactions, she said. Ripple already had lesser versions of such tools in place, Ms. O\u2019Gorman added, explaining that these were built because Ripple \u201cwanted to be good citizens and promote a compliant ecosystem.\u201d Addressing another contentious point, Ms. Gorman said her company had argued that Ripple Trade, a wallet application with which people can view and manage their balances of XRP, Ripple\u2019s native currency, should not be registered as a money service business, or MSB, under FinCEN rules because it was merely a software tool without power to take custody of funds or directly exchange currency. However, FinCEN was insistent, demanding that Ripple Trade be migrated to a properly registered MSB, which means that its users must submit customer identification information. FinCEN did not immediately respond to questions on this matter. Even with these clarifications, questions and speculation will continue to percolate around FinCEN\u2019s dramatic action against the second-biggest digital currency in market capitalization terms. Some wondered whether recognizing Ripple Trade as an MSB would set a precedent for pure-software bitcoin wallets such as that offered by Blockchain.info, where there are similarly no custodial or exchange service provided. But Blockchain.info global policy counsel Marco Santori said Ripple\u2019s situation \u201cwas a very special case\u201d and that the terms of the settlement \u201cdo not set a legal precedent\u2026 that much we know.\u201d It also seems impossible that FinCEN could wield similar influence over the management or monitoring of bitcoin\u2019s decentralized protocol \u2014 there is, after all, no core company leading the development and adoption of bitcoin\u2019s technology in the way that Ripple Labs leads the ripple network. \xa0But that didn\u2019t stop bitcoiners from worrying about whether the government might try. Prominent bitcoin developer Peter Todd, for one, took to Twitter put this question to Gavin Andresen, who leads a team of five core developers charged with updating and maintaining bitcoin\u2019s core code: So @gavinandresen, thoughts on FinCEN forcing Ripple to change their core protocol to add AML? How do we protect Bitcoin from that pressure? \u2014 Peter Todd (@petertoddbtc) May 6, 2015 And Jerry Brito, executive director of Washington-based think tank the Coin Center said, \u201cIt makes me nervous that FinCEN is asking protocol level changes from a company. Ripple is a special case and I hope that FinCEN understands that.\u201d Others, including New York Law School Professor Houman Shadab, made the case that FinCEN had proven that the comprehensive state-by-state regulation of bitcoin companies as money transmitters was redundant. FinCEN\u2019s fine of Ripple suggests that federal enforcement of AML laws is robust and that state-level regulation is unnecessary. #Bitcoin \u2014 Houman Shadab (@HoumanShadab) May 6, 2015 One thing\u2019s for sure, however, this action comes as as reminder that digital currencies are on enforcement agencies\u2019 radars. \u201cRock solid anti-money laundering compliance should be at the forefront of every digital currency company\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Perianne Boring, President of the Washington-based Digital Chamber of Commerce.\xa0(Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Today\u2019s news, that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was a co-lead investor in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin-services firm Circle Internet Financial, is only the latest in a string of stories about Wall Street and bitcoin. It\u2019s clear interest about the digital currency is increasing on the Street. Horizons columnist Michael Casey sat down at the MoneyBeat desk to talk about the news, and what it means for bitcoin.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $231.07, down 1.91% (via CoinDesk) \u2013A flurry of new payment products targeted at the developing world has revived hopes that bitcoin can gain a foothold in a promising market that has until now eluded the digital currency. Some of these initiatives deal with one of the main obstacles for bitcoin businesses hoping to crack into the $500 billion global remittance market: price volatility. Although bitcoin\u2019s fees are much lower than those of traditional money transmitters such as Western Union and Moneygram, the fluctuation in the price can offset that if the value declines before recipients convert bitcoin into their home currency. Now, some firms are using high-tech hedging strategies to tackle this problem while others are just absorbing the currency risk and charging a fee for it. Abra, a startup unveiled at last month\u2019s Launch Festival in San Francisco, confronts volatility by turning people\u2019s smartphones into sophisticated, quasi-autonomous financial entities. These devices store money on the phone and then enter into a series of automated \u201csmart contracts\u201d with Abra\u2019s computers \u2014 computerized derivative agreements that hedge volatility and lock in the original dollar value. Abra aggregates all these mini contracts into a single daily derivative position that is sold to a large counterparty. This dynamic financial balancing act is constantly going on in the background between the phone, Abra and the market, yet all the user sees is a fixed dollar amount \u2013 or that of some other traditional currency \u2013 at which the money was originally uploaded. To allow recipients to cash out, thousands of tellers have signed up in the pilot markets of the U.S. and the Philippines to carry a cash float and dispense with physical notes and coins in return for transfers to their Abra-enabled smartphones, says Bill Barhydt, the firm\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer. In a competing move, Robocoin, a leading maker of physical bitcoin ATMs, on Tuesday unveiled its new Romit software, which uses a network of physical bitcoin ATMs, designated kiosks that use web-enabled devices, and texts to recipients\u2019 cellphones to allow rapid cross-border remittance payments. The service charges a flat 4% fee to cover the exchange rate risk borne by the firm. Coming at the problem from a different direction is Tether, formerly known as Realcoin, which offers a dollar-backed digital token that\u2019s imbedded into bitcoin transactions as a vehicle for transferring fixed dollar value. Unlike Abra or Robocoin, Tether takes on a debt to its customers, contractually promising to keep their digital currency holdings locked one-to-one at the original dollar price. It stands by this promise by building and maintaining a transparently reported reserve in dollars. Earlier this month, Tether signed a deal with GoCoin, an international bitcoin payment-processing firm, allowing merchants that receive payments in bitcoin to settle their trades in tether tokens instead of a more expensive dollar wire from a bank. BitReserve also accumulates a transparent reserve to back its fixed-value promise. But it uses a proprietary, cloud-based system rather than bitcoin\u2019s decentralized blockchain ledger as the infrastructure through which users transfer value to each other. Sensing an opportunity in remittances, BitReserve recently signed a deal with Mexico\u2019s Grupo Elektra to use its network of department stores as outlets for funds that Mexican immigrants send home from the U.S. While those initiatives aim to shield people from bitcoin\u2019s price, other new projects encourage them to own bitcoin outright. On Tuesday, Latin American social media network Taringa! announced it was partnering with bitcoin wallet provider Xapo to make ad revenue-sharing payments in the digital currency to those among its 75 million users who actively provide popular content. Also this week, Chilean bitcoin exchange SurBTC launched with an ace up its sleeve: a $40,000 grant from the Chilean government. Whether any of these projects succeed in building emerging-market adoption for bitcoin remains to be seen. But innovators are clearing going after that market hard. (Michael Casey) \u2013It\u2019s official, more or less: MIT\u2019s famed Media Lab has become the principal home and funding source for the small team of developers responsible for maintaining and improving bitcoin\u2019s core software. Gavin Andresen, who bears the title of Chief Scientist for the six-person core development team, announced on his blog Wednesday that he and two other core developers, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields, had moved to the MIT Media Lab\u2019s new Digital Currency Initiative, ending their previous status as employees of the Bitcoin Foundation. The three other core developers, who draw salaries from different employers, will continue in that status. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Foundation is going through its own restructuring \u2013 with two new leaders at its helm \u2013 as it strives to restore an image tarnished by scandal and the mismanagement of funds. Bitcoin venture capital investor Brock Pierce has been elected Chairman of the Foundation, fresh after businessman Bruce Fenton took over as the new Executive Director replacing Patrick Murck, who resigned earlier this month amid tensions at the financially strapped foundation. Messrs. Murck and Pierce were among a group of board members who had sought to extract and separate core development funding from the foundation\u2019s unstable political structure. A charter that had given equal votes to members representing individuals and those representing industry was paralyzing decision-making and had left enterprise donors, which provided 85% of the foundation\u2019s funds, unwilling to continue underwriting the body. Mr. Murck\u2019s plan was to create a separate, industry-funded institution to finance development while leaving the foundation to focus on promotional efforts, information and public outreach. But that strategic plan was scuttled after dissident board member Olivier Janssens released a statement declaring the foundation to be \u201ceffectively bankrupt\u201d and calling for an alternative overhaul model in which core development would be funded through a separate crowd-funding mechanism. Mr. Janssens\u2019 plan never saw the light of day, either \u2013 mostly because MIT Media Lab Director Joicho Ito announced an alternative idea earlier this month: his institution would function as a reliably funded, neutral home for bitcoin development. Mr. Ito\u2019s initiative appears to have placated industry-based donors eager to see a long-term commitment to core development. For now, the three developers will be paid out of MIT Media Lab\u2019s central budget, which is itself funded by donations from companies. But in an interview, Brian Forde, who will head the Digital Currency Initiative, said \u201cwe\u2019ve had an outpouring of people who are interested in supporting it as well.\u201d Before taking this position, Mr. Forde was senior advisor for mobile and data innovation at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. His involvement and those of other respected experts \u2013 including legendary encryption expert Ron Rivest and MIT economist Simon Johnson \u2013 have been welcomed by many in the bitcoin community, who see a chance to earn more legitimacy for the digital currency. It stands in contrast to the Bitcoin Foundation, which has been undermined by infighting, financial mismanagement and legal scandals. Still, Mr. Pierce said \u201cthe foundation isn\u2019t going anywhere, though we have a lot of work to do.\u201d With Mr. Fenton\u2019s appointment, he argued, \u201cthe board has become functional.\u201d Mr. Pierce added, \u201cWe did the right thing in choosing to spin out Core Dev.\u201d (Michael Casey) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$224.41, up 0.05% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013A rapidly growing Latin American social network will start paying its content-providing members in bitcoin, offering a service that supporters of the digital currency hope could spur mainstream adoption in the region. Launched Tuesday by Taringa!, whose 75 million unique users \xa0puts it second only to Facebook in the region, the project combines an ad revenue-sharing model akin to that of Google Inc.\u2019s YouTube with the Argentine-owned site\u2019s unique ranking system to incentivize popular content. The system was developed in partnership with Xapo, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based bitcoin wallet and custodial service provider. Taringa! c0-founder Hern\xe1n Botbol said his firm had been wanting to introduce a revenue-sharing model to add to an existing, non-financial incentive system that encourages popular content and helped his firm achieve rapid network growth. However, Latin America\u2019s \u201chorrendous,\u201d underdeveloped financial system made it impossible to deliver funds, he said. Credit-card networks aren\u2019t developed enough and bank account penetration isn\u2019t deep enough for users to receive payments in their traditional currencies. \u201cWe have had this on our mind, mainly because we think we can bring more people to create great content and also because we think that it\u2019s fair, given that all this that we have is just because our users are creating the content,\u201d Mr. Botbol said. \xa0\u201cBut we never were able to do that because the infrastructure is horrendous \u2013 even if you send someone a check, [without sufficient banking services] they don\u2019t know what to do with that.\u201d Taringa!\u2019s agreement with Xapo is also designed to give content providers the opportunity to use and share their earned bitcoins within the community. They will have the capacity to send tips to one and another and Taringa! itself will facilitate purchases of consumer goods \u2013 starting with digitally delivered virtual products such as games, said Mr. Botbol. On Friday, Mr. Botbol outlined the project to a small luncheon gathering of venture capitalists and bitcoin businessmen at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz in Menlo Park, Calif.\xa0 There, it prompted discussion about how such projects might expand the transactional use of bitcoin, which after rapid growth among a mostly tech-savvy core of early adopters has struggled to make a sizable dent in developed-country payment markets, where bank-issued credit and debit cards dominate. Bitcoin enthusiasts\u2019 hope is that projects such as the Taringa!-Xapo partnership \u2013 which focus on ways bitcoin can be used where the traditional financial system is unable to deliver \u2013 could be an impetus for wider adoption in the developing world, where many believe digital currencies have their best chance of success. The deal is part of a new emerging-markets-focused strategy for Xapo, which has become the biggest custodian of digital currencies in the world, mostly by developed economy-based long-term investors in bitcoin. In an interview, Xapo CEO Wences Casares said he sees fresh opportunities in the developing world, \u201cwhere people are using bitcoin not as a store of value or an investment but as a way to spend on online.\u201d Bitcoin can challenge the traditional financial model in many such places, Mr. Wences said, because that bank-centric system has failed to facilitate e-commerce, even though it\u2019s something that people clearly want. In Latin America, where well-functioning web sites of the U.S. are visible but inaccessible, \u201cpeople can see that you can you transact, but they cannot actually transact,\u201d said Mr. Casares. \u201cIt\u2019s a little obscene; it\u2019s like they\u2019re teasing you.\u201d Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$xx,up/ down xx% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013\u201cI\u2019m not so keen on bitcoin, but I do like the blockchain.\u201d We hear variants of that refrain a lot lately, as Wall Street firms, mainstream tech companies and even a few governments awaken to the potential non-currency uses of bitcoin\u2019s underlying \u201cblockchain\u201d ledger technology. These institutions are wary of a digital currency that\u2019s associated with criminality, wild price fluctuations and security concerns. But they like the idea that bitcoin\u2019s public blockchain, a public ledger that authenticated and updated by a network of independent computers, can more efficiently manage corporate databases, streamline payments systems, automate legal contracts and improve work processes. Here\u2019s the thing, though: Can you actually have a blockchain without a cryptocurrency at its core? Many of the impassioned enthusiasts who populate bitcoin talk forums often recoil with disdain at that suggestion. The coin and blockchain are inseparable, they contend, arguing that you need a unit of value to create the incentive system that encourages the computer owners \u2013 known as \u201cminers\u201d \u2014 to verify transactions and update the ledger. Without bitcoin, they say, the blockchain would not be backed by multi-million-dollar investments in expensive mining infrastructure; anybody could just take over the network, which would render the blockchain useless. Now, a host of new companies is seeking to prove the bitcoin old guard wrong. There are reasons to believe they could succeed \u2013 with one important and potentially contentious caveat: These new services must work off a centralized or a quasi-centralized structure. Under this model, computers assigned to verify transactions wouldn\u2019t be motivated by bitcoin rewards but because they are tasked and authorized to do so by a central entity, be it a company, a consortium of companies, a not-for-profit organization or even a government agency.\xa0 They would be \u201cpermissioned\u201d verifiers, rather than bitcoin\u2019s \u201cpermissionless\u201d miners. That\u2019s controversial because it flies against bitcoin\u2019s Holy Grail of pure decentralization. A centralized blockchain looks more like the traditional financial system in which a \u201ctrusted third party\u201dmanages all information. What would be the point, critics of these new offerings say, of such a blockchain? How is it an improvement over an ordinary corporate database? The answer, says Preston Byrne, the London-based co-founder of Eris Industries Ltd, is that a blockchain can be programmed to manage relationships between different units within an organization and thus achieve levels of \u201cdata-driven integration\u201d that were previously impossible. The presence of a verifiable, indisputable record of blockchain \u201ctransactions\u201d means that disparate units \u2013 let\u2019s say, a company\u2019s payrolls department, its Treasury, its human resources division \u2013 can carry out functions without requiring human intervention by different managers. What\u2019s key, says Mr. Byrne, is the idea of \u201csmart contracts,\u201d which function as a set of automated instructions for a computer to perform if a set of conditions is in place. Blockchain-adjudicated smart contracts can make organizational processes more efficient and integrated. A proprietary blockchain solution could, for example, allow a multinational to fluidly integrate communications between the otherwise independently formed databases and software systems of different subsidiaries in different countries. In a provocative \xa0paper released earlier this month, cryptocurrency consultant Tim Swanson argued that decentralized cryptocurrency systems such as bitcoin are deeply flawed, in part because the anonymous, unidentifiable miners that stand behind the blockchain\u2019s legitimacy are incompatible with a real-world legal system that requires identification. Mr. Swanson also worries about the theoretical possibility that some self-interested actor could take over the network and delegitimize past transactions. That risk, he says, would deter big financial firms from seeking to use the blockchain for transmitting and settling very large transactions. Mr. Swanson spotlights 11 firms developing permissioned blockchains, a list that includes Eris, which is building blockchain solutions for clients; Hyperledger , which is focused on efficient settlement solutions for financial firms; and payments system provider Ripple Labs, by the far most well-known and well-funded of this category. The bigger issue is whether such a model of permissioned and centralized blockchains can still fulfill bitcoin supporters\u2019 grand, Utopian vision of a technology to empower individuals and break down monopoly power. In a private Twitter message, Mr. Byrne, who finds himself frequently arguing with bitcoiners, wrote: \u201cThere are two ways to go about the \u2018change the world\u2019 thing: sledgehammer, trying to break down the gate, [or] surreptitiously through a back door. We\u2019re after the latter.\u201d Yet, right across Silicon Valley, investors are betting that bitcoin\u2019s decentralized model can achieve profound structural change. Venture capitalists have poured more than $600 million into projects based on bitcoin. The debate will continue and as corporate America warms to blockchain solutions, tensions over the two models seem certain to grow.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

The U.S. unit of Spanish bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria is trying to speed things up by introducing a new service Wednesday that allows its customers to send and receive money instantly. BBVA Compass is providing the service through Dwolla, one of a growing number of financial-technology start-ups that circumvent the national payments infrastructure that has been in place for decades. That system, called Automated Clearing House, is a fund-transfer network that is an alternative to paper checks and credit cards. ACH is widely used by banks for the transfer of funds between institutions, as well as online payment providers such as PayPal, a unit of eBay But it can take days for an ACH payment to clear when the funds are being transferred between two banks. The group that oversees the ACH network said last month that it is taking \u201cinitial steps\u201d toward same-day settlement. \u201cReal-time isn\u2019t something that customers just want, but it is something they expect,\u201d said Chad Ballard, director of mobility and new digital business technology at BBVA Compass. The regional bank operates nearly 700 branches in Texas, Alabama, California, Florida and other states. Dwolla is based in Des Moines, Iowa. BBVA is the largest financial institution to join the Dwolla network, which has a relationship with a credit union in Iowa. Mr. Ballard said the Dwolla option will be appealing for BBVA business customers, who can use it as a payroll tool. BBVA customers can send money to each other instantly or open a Dwolla account if they want to send money between financial institutions. Transactions that run through the Dwolla network cost 25 cents or are free if the transaction amount is $10 or less. Customers open a Dwolla account and then can send money using an email address, phone number or identification number.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$254.57, up 0.02% (via\xa0CoinDesk) The Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s factious relationship with the bitcoin community is again being tested after a disgruntled new board member declared the digital currency advocacy group to be \u201ceffectively bankrupt\u201d and called for a membership rebellion against a leadership that he accused of acting in secrecy. In response Tuesday, the board of directors systematically disputed \xa0the dramatic claims that newly elected Olivier Janssens had made on Saturday morning, though the leadership of the most high-profile bitcoin representative body did acknowledge that its finances are seriously depleted due to the past year\u2019s collapse in the price of the digital currency. Change is needed, longer-serving board members concede \u2013 just not the nihilistic change that Mr. Janssens is calling for. At issue is a philosophical divide over how to make the organization financially viable while ensuring that funding keeps flowing to a small group of programmers who do critical work maintaining and updating bitcoin\u2019s core software. This cleavage reflects deep-seated tensions within the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s membership, whose voting power is equally divided between a smaller group of industry donors, which together provide 85% of group\u2019s funding, and more than 2,000 lesser-contributing individuals, many of whom hold strong anti-corporate views. Driven by a belief in the \u201cdecentralizing\u201d power of bitcoin, which strips out fee-charging middlemen from transfers of money and assets, individual enthusiasts can often be suspicious of \u201ccentralizing\u201d businesses that seek to profit from the digital currency\u2019s technology. Mr. Janssens, who in February was elected by the Foundation\u2019s individual members to a board seat representing their interests, posted a statement on the organization\u2019s online forum on Saturday stating that the group had \u201cno money left\u201d and had fired 90% of its staff, blaming this on gross mismanagement by a board that had \u201cfailed to tell [members] the truth.\u201d He also accused the existing management of seeking to centralize control over core development of bitcoin\u2019s open-source core software \u2013 something he contends the bitcoin community doesn\u2019t want the Foundation involved in \u2013 and called for members to force a vote for change, including the entity\u2019s possible dissolution. In an interview, Mr. Janssens said he had been confronted with \u201ccertain truths\u201d about the state of the Foundation after he joined the board and \u201cfelt obligated to share them with members.\u201d In its rebuttal statement, the Foundation\u2019s board said it \u201cis not bankrupt nor have there been any discussions regarding a potential bankruptcy.\u201d It said the claim of 90% staff layoffs was also false while acknowledging that in light of the \u201ctough decisions\u2026made to trim down programs\u201d and focus singularly on core development goals some staff members had \u201cleft voluntarily.\u201d Executive Director Patrick Murck himself had \u201cvolunteered to take himself off payroll\u201d and work as a volunteer, it said. Critically, the board noted that \u201cpotential donors and investors interested in funding core development [had] expressed concerns over the Foundation\u2019s corporate governance structure \u2014 that is specifically an elected board.\u201d This governance problem \u2013 the notion that industry donors fear that the elected board\u2019s 50/50 split left its programs at risk of being disrupted by rebellion from individual representatives \u2013 was directly addressed in a strategic plan approved at a March 31 board meeting. Disclosed along with the board\u2019s statement Tuesday, its strategic plan would spin off an entity dubbed New Co. that would be entirely funded by industry donors. It\u2019s role would be to pay for work by bitcoin\u2019s five-person core coding team \u2013 three of whom currently draw a salary from the Foundation \u2013 and develop a standards body around the code. Separately, a \u201cBitcoin Foundation v. 2.0\u201d entity would persist under the current governance structure, but with a slimmed down staff focused entirely on bitcoin promotional activities such as conferences. Though Mr. Janssen also wants to extract the elected board-run Foundation from core development financing, the board\u2019s strategic plan contravened an alternative solution he\xa0 had put forward when campaigning for election. He wants to launch an independent, crowd-funded trust fund \u2014 and has vowed to commit $100,000 of his own money into it \u2013 for bitcoin Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen and his team to use as they see fit. This, he argued in his Saturday statement, was consistent with the wishes of the bitcoin community, which, via his election, had made it \u201cclear that people did not want the Foundation meddling with core development.\u201d Members\u2019 responses to Mr. Janssens\u2019 post were divided. Some applauded him for speaking out and vowed to help him force change at the institution, but others echoed the concerns of one Foundation member, Sebastian Jurk. He said dissolving the foundation would be a \u201cbad advertisement\u201d for bitcoin, generating harmful headlines such as \u201cBitcoin is bankrupt\u201d or \u201cBitcoin is dead.\u201d Mr. Jannsen\u2019s rebellion has gained tacit support from Jim Harper, a Cato Institute fellow and former Foundation employee who was also elected to fill an individual board member seat in the February election. \u201cThe Foundation has become very much industry-oriented and very much a disappointment to the community,\u201d Mr. Harper said in an interview. How this is resolved may come down to the preferences of Mr. Andresen, the leader of the bitcoin core development team. In a post responding to Mr. Janssens\u2019 he wrote, \u201cI still think the best way to move forward with core dev funding is some type of not-for-profit legal entity, whether that is Olivier\u2019s crowdfunded Trust or something else (or both) I don\u2019t really care.\u201d Then he added, \u201cI DO care that it is legal, transparent, and that I\u2019m never put in the position of deciding how to divvy up a Big Pile Of Money.\u201d \xa0(Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $246.45, up 1.3% (via CoinDesk) - Being journalists with myriad responsibilities around here, we didn\u2019t immediately get a chance to read the criminal complaint against two former FBI agents accused of pilfering more than $1 million worth of bitcoin during the investigation into the online drug bazaar Silk Road and Ross Ulbricht. Now that we have had a chance to read it, our response is\u2026wow. The complaint (you can\xa0read the whole thing here)\xa0reads like the plot of a black comedy\u2013which we can see this one day becoming. Two agents, Carl Force and Shaun Bridges, from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who are part of a task force investigating a 22-year old kid who\u2019s running a global online drug market that uses a controversial digital currency, were allegedly stealing the currency themselves, from the kid they\u2019re investigating, each apparently unaware of what the other is doing. They are done in by other FBI agents combing through data from a laptop owned by Mr. Ulbricht that was used against him in court. We can only imagine the shock those agents got when they uncovered evidence that \u201cFrench Maid,\u201d the screen name of somebody who\u2019d been extorting Mr. Ulbricht, was allegedly one of their own. Mr. Bridges\u2019 lawyer said his client is innocent. Mr. Force\u2019s lawyer declined to comment. If the allegations are true, they are brazen. The complaint says the agents stole more than $1 million of bitcoin, moved it into personal accounts, forged their boss\u2019s signature, pressured a startup money-service into moving the stolen money, and extorted the very people they were investigating. At one point, Mr. Force had allegedly moved his bitcoins into an account at Venmo, which froze the account because it looked suspicious. He then grabbed his supervisor\u2019s signature stamp to sign a document he sent to Venmo, ordering the service to open up the account. Mr. Force then, allegedly, tried to convince Venmo not to talk to anybody else about the order. Venmo went to the DEA anyway, forcing Mr. Force to try and enlist another agent in a scheme to seize Venmo\u2019s bank accounts (this was apparently unsuccessful). After the agents arrested Curtis Green, a Silk Road web admin, in January 2013, they gained access to Silk Road\u2019s accounts. That same month, Silk Road\u2019s accounts were pilfered \u2013 by Mr. Bridges, the complaint alleges. (There was a widely reported hack of Silk Road in February 2013 that resulted in $2.7 million disappearing. It isn\u2019t clear if these are different incidents). The complaint says he took that money, and moved it into an account at Mt. Gox. Mr. Bridges moved $820,000 from Silk Road to Mt. Gox, and then to an LLC he started, \u201cQuantum International Investments.\u201d On May 7, the $820,000 went from Mt. Gox to Quantum. On May 9, Mr. Bridges signed off on a seizure warrant for Mt. Gox and its bank accounts. As you can imagine, Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s defense team has a thought or two on this. \u201cThe government\u2019s considerable efforts at keeping this monumental scandal from being aired at Ross Ulbricht\u2019s trial is itself scandalous,\u201d Joshua Dratel, his lawyer, said in a statement, the entirety of which you can read here. Mr. Ulbricht was convicted in February on a number of charges related to his operation of Silk Road. Sentencing is scheduled for May 15. Mr. Dratel said in the statement that the defense was told about the FBI investigation of the FBI agents five weeks before Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s trial was to begin, but were barred from using any information from that investigation as part of the defense case. \u201cThe defense has already moved for a new trial,\u201d he said.

The one-time bitcoin entrepreneur reported to federal prison on Monday to serve a two-year sentence for his involvement in what prosecutors alleged was a drug scheme involving his virtual-currency exchange and an online black market. Mr. Shrem, 25 years old, reported to the federal facility in Lewisburg, Pa., where he will serve his time in a minimum security camp that is adjacent to a high-security penitentiary, said Shawn Barlett, a prison spokesman. The camp holds 466 inmates, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons website. Mr. Shrem was one of the virtual currency\u2019s most prominent advocates at the time of his arrest, dealing a blow to the virtual currency\u2019s reputation just as it was attracting interest from mainstream investors and merchants. \u201cWell, I\u2019m off to prison now!\u201d Mr. Shrem tweeted on Monday, adding \u201cfollow my twitter for tweets from the inside.\u201d But Mr. Barlett, the prison spokesman, said inmates don\u2019t have access to Twitter or the internet, although they may receive restricted email. As for the prison commissary, accounts are funded the old-fashioned way \u2013 via money order, Western Union or Moneygram, according to the prison website. Mr. Shrem\u2019s attorney couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on his incarceration. Launched in 2009, bitcoin is an electronic currency that is created on computers and traded between people who store it in digital wallets. It has also raised concerns among lawmakers and regulators due to its reputation for being used for illicit activity. Mr. Shrem was the founder of BitInstant, a New York exchange that allows users to buy and sell bitcoin. He was arrested in early 2014 and indicted on charges of money-laundering and other crimes that carried a possible prison sentence of 25 years.

Amid a slew of deals involving prominent finance and tech companies lie signs that the U.S. business establishment is exploring innovative new enterprise uses for digital currencies. They are making early, tentative bets that the so-called blockchain-ledger technology behind bitcoin might one day transform how banks, businesses and even smart appliances circulate money, assets and sensitive data around the world. The interest is most evident on Wall Street, where there\u2019s a sense that the bank-dominated, centralized pathways through which international finance passes are long overdue for the kind of Internet-driven cost savings that have affected other industries. \u201cThe price of handling bits [of data]has come down by a factor of 10,000 fold over the last generation; it\u2019s high time that the costs of payments processing fall by a factor of even two,\u201d says former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. \u201cBitcoin offers the prospect of necessary and important disruption in finance for the benefit of buyers and sellers rather than financiers and middlemen.\u201d Most ordinary consumers remain wary of using an unproven, six-year-old digital currency that many associate with illicit drugs, extreme price fluctuations and security risks. But the talk now is that bitcoin\u2019s potential lies more as a low-profile, back-office phenomenon than as mainstream medium of exchange for buying groceries. The idea is that blockchain ledgers, which are verified, updated and maintained by a decentralized network of independently owned computers, for the first time let people and businesses trust each other in peer-to-peer online exchanges of assets, money and information. In cutting out intermediating middlemen, the theory goes, this technology could slash costs, cut settlement times and reduce default risks. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for Wall Street to streamline some operations that are pretty antiquated,\u201d says Duncan Niederauer, the former chief executive of the NYSE Euronext, who this week became an adviser to TeraExchange, the first Commodities Futures Trading Commission-regulated bitcoin derivatives platform. There are still major hurdles to overcome. In addition to the security, criminality and price volatility concerns, it\u2019s not clear that the bitcoin network can be sufficiently scaled up. Total daily bitcoin transactions currently average around $50 million, a tiny sliver of the more than $5 trillion traded in world foreign exchange markets. However, with regulators in the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere devising digital-currency rules aimed at both protecting users and encouraging innovation, companies are exploring possibilities. It marks a big change from a year ago, when bitcoin was mostly viewed as a fringe idea for computer geeks and libertarian opponents of government-issued currencies. In January, the New York Stock Exchange, USAA Bank, Spanish banking conglomerate Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and former Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit took stakes in bitcoin consumer services and exchange provider Coinbase. USAA and Citigroup\u2019s venture capital arm, Citi Ventures, are also doing mentoring work with startups at an accelerator program run by San Francisco\u2019s Plug and Play Tech Center. This week, Nasdaq OMX Group inked a deal providing order-matching technology to New York startup Noble Markets, which is building a high-tech marketplace in which hedge funds and other institutions can trade digital currency-based assets. Nasdaq\u2019s executive vice president for market technology, Lars Ottersg\xe5rd, said his firm is actively exploring ways in which blockchains \u201ccould be leveraged to reduce risk in markets.\u201d Meanwhile, leading figures from Wall Street and Washington are, like Mr. Niederauer, taking job offers in the digital-currency sector. Long-time J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. executive Blythe Masters, who is credited with pioneering the global credit derivatives industry, this month took the helm of blockchain trade settlement firm Digital Assets Holdings. In October, former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Arthur Levitt became an adviser to payment processor Bitpay and in January, digital currency-based payments platform Ripple Labs named former National Economic Council director Gene Sperling as a director. BitFury, which provides specialized computers for the \u201cmining\u201d process of confirming bitcoin transactions, has tapped Jason Weinstein, a former head of the Department of Justice\u2019s criminal division, as an adviser. Various new projects intend to offer a more robust, regulated and Wall Street-friendly trading environment for bitcoin, creating opportunities for investors who were otherwise unable or unwilling to participate in the volatile, hacking-prone web sites that have handled bitcoin trading until now. New York entrepreneur Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group this week opened public trading in its Bitcoin Investment Trust. That fund might soon face competition if twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss earn SEC approval for a full-blown exchange trade fund. With these new trading instruments, the founding firms are hoping to create opportunities for a wider pool of investors \u2013 including those holding the strategic view that new non-currency uses for the blockchain will generate significant demand for the underlying currency. Even if those uses don\u2019t necessarily involve payments in bitcoin, it is expected that the digital currency will still be needed as the foundation for transactions and that should translate into a higher price for bitcoin. Widening the investment pool could also help quell bitcoin\u2019s notorious price volatility \u2014 which could make it more appealing as a currency too. In 2013, the digital currency\u2019s price soared from around $13 in January to a late-November peak of $1,150, only to drop 85% over the following 13 months. Bitcoin\u2019s price has since stabilized around $250, according to an index produced by news service Coindesk. Big-name tech companies are also testing the waters. International Business Machines has a project to research how blockchain technology could allow network-connected gadgets exchange data, money and contracts within a future \u201cInternet of Things.\u201d And Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. has joined a slew of top venture capitalists putting a combined $116 million into a startup called 21 that\u2019s developing blockchain-enabled products. There are still plenty of skeptics, however. Boston University professor Mark T. Williams, a vocal bitcoin critic, says regulation needs to be tougher to protect consumers. \u201cWhat complicates things is this is a nationless currency,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat regulatory bodies are supposed to be responsible for it? \u201c At the other extreme, libertarian-minded early adopters warn that regulation and Wall Street co-optation undermine the empowering, decentralizing elements that first drew them to bitcoin. Outspoken anarchist Cody Wilson, who helped design a technology making it harder to trace bitcoin transactions, bemoans that new bitcoin entrepreneurs \u201cdesire authority.\u201d They \u201cgive lip service to libertarian ideals but actually discard anything that appears to be revolutionary,\u201d he said. Many also wonder whether banks and other legacy institutions might one day quash the technology if it threatens revenues from businesses such as credit cards. Still, the cost savings and potential efficiencies could prove too enticing for businesses to resist. \u201cNot only is it not a threat, it\u2019s potentially an opportunity,\u201d says Mr. Niederauer. \u201cIf the train\u2019s leaving the station, you\u2019d rather be on it and be the conductor, than a bystander on the platform.\u201d \u2013 Follow Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $250.46, up 1.8% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin and Wall Street have been like two hostile cultures, each warily eyeing the other. But attitudes are changing as the sides get to know each other, and nowhere are the emissaries of those worlds working together more directly than at Silicon Valley\u2019s premiere start-up shop, the Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, Calif. Plug and Play runs a program that puts new companies through a three-month boot camp of sorts. Entrepreneurs are given seed capital (for an equity stake, of course), mentoring, networking and the nuts-and-bolts of simply building a company from the ground up. Nearly 3,000 start-ups have gone through the program, including LendingClub and Zoosk Inc. The latest accelerator program is focused on startups in financial technology, \u201cfintech\u201d in the parlance, and includes a handful of bitcoin startups like ChangeTip and 37Coins. They are working directly with mentors from financial firms like USAA, Citi Ventures, and Capital One, and the interest appears to be very much mutual. For both sides, it\u2019s a chance to learn what the other has to offer. For USAA, which earlier this year was part of the group that invested in bitcoin-services firm\xa0Coinbase, its interest in bitcoin is being driven by the military servicemen and women who are its clients. Over the past nine months, said Vic Pascucci, vice president of corporate development,\xa0it\u2019s become clear to the firm than its members are getting interested in an using bitcoin, to a higher degree than the general population. \u201cWhen we see these trends, it\u2019s our job to understand them,\u201d said Mr. Pascucci.\xa0So when the mentorship opportunity came up at Plug and Play, USAA\xa0moved in. Literally. They sent a small team to the campus, and are operating out of an office there. \u201cOur product and services will look very different in six months, nevertheless two years,\u201d said Zach Gibson, a vice president of product innovation at USAA. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we drive change in our products and services.\u201d For Nick Sullivan, founder of the micropayments service ChangeTip, the program is a way for forge relationships in the financial world, and possibly find investments as well. He, too, has seen the change in the banking world in its attitude toward bitcoin. \u201cMy assumption going in [to meetings] is they may feel threatened by bitcoin, but instead what I see is that they are welcoming it.\u201d Jonathan Zobro is one of the founders of 37Coins, a bitcoin startup that\u2019s building a remittance platform. The group is operating in the Phillipines, on one end of the remittance trade, and is looking to gain the knowledge on how to build the platform out for this side,\xa0the expat side. So far he\u2019s been impressed by the talks he\u2019s had with the teams from USAA and Citi Ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising how much they knew,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to have both sides of the market covered, and it feels like we\u2019re starting to get that.\u201d He noted that he\u2019s scheduled to begin working directly with the team from Citi Ventures in a few weeks. To Saeed Amidi, Plug and Play\u2019s founder, he sees the change in attitude at the banks being driven by the pace of technology. \u201cSuddenly they are really open-minded, because they\u2019re scared to be left behind,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the tech world, the toughest to sell to are the banks.\u201d That, he said, is changing fast. \u201cThey are incredibly proactive.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - The Bitcoin Investment Trust, the first publicly traded bitcoin fund, on Thursday received formal approval for listing on OTC Markets Group\u2019s OTCQX exchange. The fund is listed under the symbol GBTC, and trading is expected to begin early next week. It\u2019s the first product from Barry Silbert\u2019s new Grayscale Investments, a digital-asset management firm being launched concurrently by his Digital Currency Group. It\u2019s also the latest addition to the growing number of bitcoin trading platforms that aim to expand bitcoin investments beyond the volatile spot exchanges and attract a new class of investors. There are platforms for trading bitcoin derivatives, like Tera Group\u2019s TeraExchange. Additionally, the Winklevoss twins are working on getting SEC approval to list their own ETF, the Winkelvoss Bitcoin Trust, and are building Gemini, a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange. While Mr. Silbert and his group chose a roundabout way in listing on OTC (you can read the background here), he said they are seeking SEC approval for the fund, and would move to list it on the NYSE or Nasdaq. All of this is\xa0designed to open bitcoin investing up to the wider world of the capital markets, to ordinary investors who have been scared off by bitcoin\u2019s wild price swings. If it all takes off, it could bring a whole new breed of investor into bitcoin. The degree to which traditional investors are willing to take a flyer on bitcoin as an investment will be one key thing to watch. \u201cOver the past three or four months, a handful of banks have started to experiment,\u201d Mr. Silbert said. \u201cSome of them are experimenting around trading, some around using the blockchain for settlement, and some are interested in deploying capital as investors.\u201d The ETF, he said, becomes one option for financial advisors and brokers who are fielding calls from clients interested in getting a taste of bitcoin. \xa0(Paul Vigna) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/26/bitbeat-plug-and-play-builds-a-bridge-between-bitcoin-wall-street/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 26, 13, 50), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: Plug and Play Builds a Bridge Between Bitcoin, Wall Street'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, the latest in cryptocurrency news and analysis, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$258.19, up 1.11% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013Bitreserve is opening up a new front in a battle to disrupt the $500 billion international remittance market. The cloud-based money transfer service, which seeks to combine the low transaction costs of bitcoin technology with the backing of a multicurrency asset reserve to control exchange-rate volatility, is adding\xa0\u201cbitpeso\u201d accounts pegged to the Mexican peso and \u201cbitrupee\u201d accounts pegged to the Indian rupee. \xa0The move is aimed at tapping the payment streams of low-income Mexican and Indian emigres to their families back home. The Mexican peso offering, announced in a blog post by CEO\xa0Halsey Minor, is tied to Bitreserve\u2019s new partnership with its largest investor, Mexican tycoon Ricardo Salinas-Pliego . It plans to allow people in Latin America to receive remittances from family members living overseas and then go to one of the Salinas Group\u2019s 2,600 Elektra retail outlets to cash out those funds in their local currency. The sales pitch is that these transactions occur at much lower cost than remittances sent through established, bank-based services such as Western Union and Moneygram. Mr. Minor, best known as the founder of Internet news and information service CNet and later as a co-founder of cloud-based enterprise software company Salesforce, talks in quasi-revolutionary terms about the project. In his blog post, he wrote, \u201cOur increasingly connected world needs a financial system that supports the fast, free, and easy movement of money, one that empowers the most vulnerable and needy of our global citizens.\u201d Illustrating those global designs, Bitreserve also unveiled a monitoring service dubbed Changemoney.org. \xa0Employing a graphical representation of the globe, the service offers a real-time and historical visualization of Bitreserve users\u2019 holdings and transfers worldwide.\xa0 According to Mr. Minor, Changemoney.org is designed to reflect \u201cthe tenets of digital currency \u2013 inclusion, fairness and transparency.\u201d From its launch in October, Bitreserve has accumulated a total of $10 million in transactions and now holds over $1.3 million in deposits. Those are backed by almost $1.5 million in its reserve \u2013 a publicly disclosed and perpetually updated account of assets that\u2019s intended to instill depositor confidence that the firm has enough funds to cover liabilities denominated in their accounts\u2019 respective currencies. If achieved, that gives Bitreserve the capacity to promise exchange-rate stability and at the same time earn modest interest on the conservative assets held within the reserve. Customers currently import value into Bitreserve by transferring bitcoins from a pre-existing bitcoin address. They then have the option to transfer to \u201cbitdollars\u201d or other currencies for a fee of 0.45%, after which they can shift funds around for free to other currency or asset accounts known as \u201ccards\u201d \u2013 including biteuros, bitpounds, bityen and bitgold. The goal is to end the fluctuations that customers of most bitcoin-only wallet providers face when valuing their accounts in traditional currencies. The risk of exchange rate losses is widely viewed as one of the biggest barriers for getting people to use the otherwise efficient and low-cost benefits of bitcoin transactions to send money around the world. During a visit to New York last week, Mr. Minor said Bitreserve will later this year enable customers to import funds in dollars via direct transfers from linked bank accounts, bypassing bitcoin altogether. That shift could intensify some of the challenging regulatory questions that Bitreserve faces \u2013 whether it should be regulated as a bank, for example, or licensed as a money transmitter. But Mr. Halsey says Bitreserve\u2019s extensive legal team is committed to ensuring that it is fully licensed, regulated and compliant. -Wednesday\u2019s unveiling of the\xa0U.K. government\u2019s consultative study into digital currencies has earned accolades from bitcoin advocates on both sides of the Atlantic. Some are calling its approach a model for other governments to follow. \xa0It\u2019s ironic that a report detailing extensive plans to regulate bitcoin could be so happily welcomed by bitcoiners, whose ranks were for years dominated by hard-core libertarians \xa0and anarchists who saw digital currency as way to subvert government control over money. The reaction thus speaks both to where the industry has come over the past 12 months \xa0- with bitcoin businesses now often viewing government engagement more as a desirable mark of legitimacy than a threat \u2013 and to the proactive approach Britain is taking to promoting cryptocurrency innovation. The report\u2019s key features are: 1) the government\u2019s intent to apply anti-money laundering laws to digital currency exchanges, a move not dissimilar to that taken by U.S. regulators; 2) efforts to train and equip British law enforcement bodies to confront criminal activity in digital currencies; 3) a development of a set of standards and best practices to ensure consumer protection is maximized without over-regulating the industry; 4) an injection of\xa0\xa310 million\xa0into a research institute to study new opportunities in digital currency technology. It\u2019s that last point that distinguishes the U.K. from other governments. More than giving lip service to the desirability of organic innovation \u2014 as, say, the New York Department of Financial Services has \u2014 the U.K. is putting its money where its mouth is. It seems to recognize the potential this technology holds and that it\u2019s important that Britain embrace that if London is to fulfill its goal as the world\u2019s innovation hub for financial technology, or \u201cfintech.\u201d It\u2019s one reason why Jerry Brito, executive director of Washington-based think tank, The Coin Center, wrote that Britain had \u201craise[d] the global bar for how government approach digital currencies like Bitcoin.\u201d And in the government\u2019s own backyard, Tom Robinson, the Chief Operating Officer of bitcoin custodial service Elliptic and a founding member of the U.K. Digital Currency Association, \xa0declared that measures like these \u201cwill help make the U.K. a global hub for digital currencies and maintain its position at the forefront of fintech innovation.\u201d This brings us to a key point: Will the U.K.\u2019s moves impact U.S. regulations? \xa0In an interview Wednesday for a story about his new appointment to mining company BitFury\u2019s advisory board, Jason Weinstein, the former head of the \xa0Department of Justice\u2019s criminal division, told us that the mismatch of regulatory regimes and dispersed law enforcement bodies represents a \u201chuge challenge\u201d for how governments deal with a global, borderless technology like bitcoin and called for greater cooperation and standard-setting among governments on this issue. For now, the American dominance of global finance and the fact that new players need to be in New York gives the U.S. federal and state governments leeway to act independently. But if bitcoin becomes a significant global phenomenon the calculus could change. Here\u2019s the problem: If the U.S. is perceived to be heavier handed than other countries\u2019 regulatory bodies such as Britain\u2019s, innovators will just shift their businesses to those friendlier domains. The technology allows them to be fleet-footed. Depending on how far this process goes, it could force greater coordination among governments and an effort to set common standards. What bitcoiners hope is that Britain sets that standard.

Goldman Sachs Group convened a symposium with over 350 investors and corporations on Tuesday to find some answers. Among the most likely innovation to emerge as disruptors: Car sharing and autonomous automobiles, the Internet on the factory floor, genomic testing, cancer immunotherapy and digital payments. Some autonomous driving could begin before 2020, the Goldman attendees concluded. At the same time, continued growth in car-sharing services like Uber could \u201clower the number of vehicles needed,\u201d a trend that could hurt existing automakers. But \u201cthere would be offsets from more people using cars at the expense of public transport and as older and younger passengers have greater access to mobility,\u201d according to Goldman\u2019s summation of the conference.\xa0The report also said companies like Rockwell Automation and Cisco were spending big money on the so-called \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d that is predicted to connect manufacturing, industrial equipment and other objects to the Internet. Meanwhile, recent immunotherapy cancer treatments are a \u201cparadigm shift,\u201d the Goldman report argues, providing \u201ca durable response to cancer that can be applied across a broad range of tumor types,\u201d including solid tumors. \u201cOld chemotherapies attacked tumors non-selectively and also killed normal cells, causing issues with safety and tolerability,\u201d Goldman notes. By contrast, new \u201cPD-1 therapies\u201d are an improvement because they allow \u201cthe patient\u2019s own immune system to attack cancer cells.\u201d PD-1 drugs block a protein called \u2018programmed death receptor 1\u2019, or PD-1, which acts as a brake on the immune system. PD-1 inhibitor drugs like Pembrolizumab, which recently hit the U.S. market as the first PD-1 inhibitor, release the immune system brake and allow it to destroy the cancer. \u201cThe data and rapid FDA approval of PD-1 in lung cancer support the broad application of PD-1 in cancer,\u201d Goldman says, \u201cand we should expect to see approvals in a variety of solid tumors\u2026patients will want PD-1 because it works better and is less toxic\u201d than chemotherapy. Merck & Co., Bristol-Myers and Roche Holding are leaders in the race to develop effective PD-1/PD-L1 drugs. The Goldman report also predicted big things for genomics, saying that advances in DNA sequencing technology \u201care making it feasible to analyze a cancer patient\u2019s genomic signature on a routine basis.\u201d Cancer patients could eventually receive free genetic testing, tumor profiling and immune system monitoring, all of which will be help in the fight against cancer. Attendees were split on how much Visa and Mastercard need to worry about the growing embrace of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The most likely impact will be on international foreign-currency transfers, which could become more efficient by using cryptocurrencies.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/GZuckerman', 'name': 'Gregory Zuckerman', 'twitterhandle': '@GZuckerman', 'email': 'Gregory Zuckerman'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/18/look-into-the-future-with-goldman-uber-genomics-and-bitcoin/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 18, 16, 24), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Look Into the Future With Goldman: Uber, Genomics and Bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u' The U.K. government is to regulate digital currency exchanges for the first time, in a bid to support innovation in the nascent technology while preventing criminal use. In a document released in conjunction with the announcement of UK\u2019s 2015 budget, the Treasury said that intends to apply anti-money laundering regulation to digital currency exchanges in the UK. The measures will be aimed at creating the right environment for legitimate actors in the space to flourish, while making it \u201ca hostile environment for illicit users of digital currencies,\u201d the government said. The Treasury said it plans to launch a consultation later this year to seek views on how the new regulation should be shaped, including its scope and how existing anti-money laundering regulation should be specifically applied to the sector. The consultation will also look to collect opinions on how to ensure that law enforcement bodies have the necessary skills and tools to \u201cidentify and prosecute criminal activity relating to digital currencies, including the ability to seize and confiscate digital currency funds where transactions are for criminal purposes.\u201d The government also announced that it intends to develop a set of best practices and standards for digital currency businesses to ensure consumer protection. The voluntary standards will be developed by the government, the British Standards Institution and the digital currency industry. The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne had last summer announced that he would look into how virtual and digital currencies\u2014such as bitcoin\u2013should be regulated. The Treasury launched a consultation seeking views from the industry on the matter. The document published today was the government\u2019s response to the first consultation. The government\u2019s move comes a month after the Bank of England announced that it would undertake research on central bank-issued digital currencies. This would look into the costs and benefits of a central-bank run system. The measures are part of wider push by the UK government aimed at supporting growth in its growing financial technology sector and stimulate competition in the banking sector.\xa0 The Budget also included measures to the creation of an open API (Application Programming Interface) in banking \u2013 or a set of programming instructions for accessing web-based applications that would make it easier for fintech firms to access banking data. In the document published on Wednesday the government also acknowledged the potential in the underlying technology behind digital currencies. Over the past year many in the technology and financial sector have come to believe that the distributed ledger system underpinning bitcoin and other virtual currencies can be adapted to record and transfer other types of value.\xa0 The government said it would launch a research initiative to address the opportunities and challenges for digital currency technology. The digital currency industry welcomed the government\u2019s announcements.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$285.86, down 1.56% (via\xa0CoinDesk) -Prominent digital-currency\xa0news service CoinDesk has slimmed down its editorial team. The move reflects broader changes in bitcoin\u2019s development now that a 2013-2014 surge in retail services \u2014 and the ad dollars that came with it \u2013 has taken a back seat to the institutional build-out of digital-currency technology. According to Jeremy Bonney, CoinDesk CEO, the news service has\xa0\u201cover the past couple of months\u201d\xa0laid off two sub-editors and cut back a handful of freelancer\u2019s contracts. With the full-time payroll shrinking from eleven to nine, that\u2019s hardly a massive retrenchment, not for an age in which boisterous new mainstream media outfits can come and go within months. But CoinDesk\u2019s move captures the changing times in bitcoinland, nonetheless. \u201cIn the early days of CoinDesk, things were so frenetic \u2013 many of us would wake up at 4 a.m. to publish the latest price updates, or be working on the weekends with our partners trying to drag us away from our laptops,\u201d says Mr. Bonney. \u201cWe expanded the team last year to make things smoother and easier, but as our processes got better, some of those extra staff weren\u2019t always being used to full capacity.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not heavily venture-funded, and that kind of model would always be hard to deliver value on to investors, considering we\u2019re a trade publication coming up on a million unique visitors a month.\u201d Founded in early 2013 by Shakil Khan, who was an early investor in music service Spotify and private marketplace SecondMarket, CoinDesk\u2019s initial growth coincided with an exponential increase in bitcoin\u2019s price. That drove \xa0a new wave of enthusiasts into bitcoin mining \u2014 the business of earning new bitcoins in return for contributing computer resources to the management of the digital currency\u2019s payment system . It also fueled retail demand for bitcoin currency trading while a growing group of \u201cbitcoin millionaires\u201d demanded merchant services so they could spend their digital currency on things. All that created opportunities for consumer-oriented businesses. Makers of the mining rigs that users would set up in their basements jumped in. And when that model became too expensive for individuals, providers of \u201ccloud mining\u201d contracts started appearing. There was also a rapid expansion in retail-focused bitcoin currency exchanges such as Slovenia-based Bitstamp and the now-defunct Tokyo-based site Mt. Gox and in the merchant services provided by the likes of BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin. As they competed for the bitcoin enthusiasts\u2019 business, these firms beefed up their marketing, promotional and advertising efforts. But part way through 2014, as the collapse of Mt. Gox and a string of scandals drew the attention of regulators and fostered skepticism among the general public, the price of bitcoin fell sharply from the $1,000-plus level it hit in late 2013, quelling the hyped-up enthusiasm of the early users. Until a more robust physical and regulatory infrastructure was built out, various commentators argued, the frontier for mainstream consumer adoption was running up against its limit. Yet since then there has also been mounting interest among investors looking to build out that infrastructure. As innovators came up with new non-currency uses for bitcoin\u2019s core blockchain ledger technology, venture capitalists have poured hundreds of millions into the sector while Wall Street investors have launched projects allowing hedge funds and other institution to trade digital currencies in a more sophisticated, regulated setting. These well-funded newcomers will demand information services but they won\u2019t necessarily buy ads targeted at consumers. So, it\u2019s not surprising that CoinDesk is trying to diversify its revenue stream, getting into the conference business and launching a new subscription-based research product with deeper analysis. Despite the funding challenges, Mr. Bonney remains upbeat about the future. \u201cThis year already, ad revenues are growing, and we\u2019ve launched research reports as well as the first in our Expert Briefing series,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we expand further into events, we aim to do with conferences what we\u2019ve already done with online content for the bitcoin economy.\u201d\xa0(Michael Casey) \xa0 -Bitcoin\u2019s growth in the real world may be up for debate. At South by Southwest, though, there is no debate: there, bitcoin is growing. The sprawling film/music/culture/tech festival that takes over Austin, Texas this year dedicated a full one-day conference to bitcoin, which on Monday brought some of the biggest names in the industry to the Lone Star state. In addition, bitcoin was represented on the exhibition floor of the Austin Convention Center, and was discussed in other panels outside of Monday\u2019s event. (That includes one that \xa0I moderated Tuesday that featured Circle Internet Financial CEO Jeremy Allaire, \xa0DCiq founder Mary Dent and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert.) Bitcoin\u2019s presence has slowly been rising at South by Southwest, which purports to be a showcase for just about everything, from bands to films, from start-up businesses to General Electric Co. Towns like Denton, Texas, have booths, as well as nations like Mexico, Italy, Ireland, and Argentina. There were only scattered bitcoin panels last year. BitPay sponsored an exhibit, and Robocoin brought their ATMs to Austin.\xa0But the cryptocurrency was just an oddity then, like a guitar player on the corner of Sixth and Congress. Some local enthusiasts wanted to change that, and found that the festivals organizers wanted to as well. The idea for the bitcoin conference came from three Austin residents, Naveed Lalani, Christa Clark, and Chris Hogue, who organized the entire thing on their own. They\u2019d been to South by Southwest\xa0in previous years, had seen the scattered bitcoin sightings, but also saw a lot of excitement around the subject. \u201cWe saw the opportunity to do a full-day conference,\u201d Mr. Lalani told MoneyBeat. They began planning for the bitcoin conference last June, getting a lot of help from the festival\u2019s organizers. \u201cThey embraced us,\u201d Mr. Lalani said. \u201cIt felt like we needed to do it,\u201d said Christ Valentine, who runs South by Southwest\u2019s Startup Village showcase. Having a full day of panels dedicated to one subject isn\u2019t something they usually do, he said, but he felt like this was one subject that warranted it. \u201cBitcoin is the future,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are so many questions.\u201d The conference, which occupied Salon G on the sixth floor of the Hilton, across the street from the convention center, drew industry insiders from around the globe. Topics ranged from the basics of bitcoin, to bitcoin in the emerging markets, to the so-called bitcoin 2.0 applications. Nicholas Cary of Blockchain flew in from London on Sunday night, and left Monday afternoon, but sat in on the first panel, along with Stephen Pairs (BitPay), Will O\u2019Brien (BitGo) and Tatiana Moroz (artist and writer). Another panel featured Charlie Lee (litecoin) and Patrick Deegan (ID3). Tina Hui (Follow the Coin), Peter Smith (Blockchain), Connie Gallippi (BitGive), and Adam Draper (Boost VC) participated in yet others. Bitcoin was represented elsewhere, too. Troy Fearnow\u2019s Cryptoart had a large, elbow-shaped space on the floor of the main exhibition hall in the convention center. Mr. Fearnow sells art prints that have QR codes for cold-storage wallets (the private keys are in a sealed envelope on the back).

Bitcoin Latest Price: $295.90, up 0.02% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik\u2019s bold plan to put mini satellites into orbit to provide secure, remote backup for the digital currency\u2019s growing store of critical data has taken a step close to becoming a reality. Mr. Garzik\u2019s company, Dunvegan Space Systems, announced Thursday that it has signed a contract with its partner, Deep Space Industries Inc., to build the first 24-unit constellation of \u201cBitSats,\u201d an idea it first unveiled nearly a year ago. Dunvegan plans to have the BitSats keep a complete record of bitcoin\u2019s ever-growing blockchain ledger, thus acting as crucial \u201cfull nodes\u201d to backup bitcoin\u2019s all-important core database at a time when the number of earth-based computers providing this vital storage service has declined. Separately, Mr. Garzik said, Dunvegan will offer BitSats to paying customers, who would use them for proprietary data storage solutions and communications services. For such companies, which might choose a space-based operation for, among the reasons, keeping their most sensitive data physically removed from potential attackers, the company already has a price menu: $1 million for one BitSat, $19 million for a full 24-unit constellation. This for-profit part of the business would monetize an operation that was initially conceived as a public utility aimed at securing bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network. \u201cAs programmers, we are always asking that higher-level question: how can you solve that problem and at the same time several other problems? And that\u2019s where the revenue model came from,\u201d Mr. Garzik said. \u201cBasically we look at [the BitSat] as a platform that can do on-demand data broadcasts to any location on earth, as well as store data for customers.\u201d Mr. Garzik, who also works for bitcoin payment processor BitPay and is a member of the five-person team assigned to coordinate development and maintenance of bitcoin\u2019s core open-source software program, initially looked at having the BitSats mine for bitcoin rewards in space. But he said it would have been prohibitively expensive as many many more solar panels would be needed to power up the high-powered chips needed to compete with fast-paced bitcoin mines on earth. As it is, the BitSat \u201cnano-satellites\u201d are small \u2013 10 cm x 10 cm x 30 cm. Yet even that is larger than the initial 10x10x10 prototype because it had to accommodate more panels to fuel the on-board computers. The small size of the units makes launching them a much more cost-effective operation than traditional, full-scale satellites because they can hitch rides with launches put other equipment into orbit. Dunvegan\u2019s partner, Deep Space Industries, is already involved in commercial spacecraft projects but is perhaps best known for its plan to develop asteroid mining.\xa0 (Michael Casey) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$283.62, up 4.52% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013Researchers at the European Central Bank, recognizing the explosion of \u201caltcoins\u201d since their last comprehensive study of digital currencies in 2012, have updated that report with a follow-up. Other than conveying a kind of legitimacy to bitcoin by the mere fact of conducting the study, the group didn\u2019t exactly come up with a ringing endorsement. The report\u2019s conclusion: bitcoin and other \u201cvirtual currency schemes\u201d \u2013 or VCS, as the ECB prefers to describe this currency-technology combination \u2013 still aren\u2019t really big enough to matter to the eurozone economy right now. But if future iterations overcome some of the flaws, the report\u2019s authors add, these \u201cinherently unstable\u201d payment tools might pose challenges to monetary authorities and so warrant continued examination. \u201cConceptually,\u201d the report concluded, \u201cVCS could jeopardise financial stability.\u201d But it added that they currently pose no such threat, \u201cgiven their limited connection to the real economy,\u2026 the low volumes traded and the lack of wide user acceptance.\u201d Although it acknowledged that digital currency technology has some potential advantages for consumers and merchants, overall the report read like a fairly comprehensive dissing. The ECB dwelled more on the risks and limitations of digital currencies than anything else. Its choice of nomenclature \u2013 emphasizing the \u201cvirtual\u201d nature of these units \u2013 reflected the ECB\u2019s prevailing view that they don\u2019t actually constitute money or currencies in accordance with any economic or legal definition. Perhaps most striking was the narrow purview of the research, which avoided addressing much of the past year\u2019s innovation in the digital currency sector. Although it contained geeky comparisons of \u201cproof of work\u201d versus \u201cproof of stake\u201d mining software programs, the two main competing validating systems for digital currency computer networks, there was close to zero discussion of the many non-currency uses for blockchain technology now being developed. Not only were these various \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d applications ignored, the report hardly addressed\xa0the notion, widely discussed in both crytpocurrency and financial circles, that digital currencies could play a back-office role in the financial system even if they are shunned by mainstream consumers and businesses. And while the ECB researchers discussed at length the critical problems of bitcoin\u2019s exchange-rate volatility and insecurity, they overlooked advances aimed at addressing these shortcomings. No mention was made of reserve-backed pegged crytpocurrencies, \u201cmultsignature\u201d password systems for protecting digital wallets, or the provision of \u201cdigital vault\u201d custodial services that come with insurance from A-rated underwriters. Not surprisingly, the report was dismissed as being out of touch by pro-bitcoin commenters on social media site Reddit\u2019s \u201cbitcoin/r\u201d forum.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $251.44, down 0.4% (via CoinDesk) - Stellar, the cryptocurrency-based payments system launched last year by Jed McCaleb, announced a partnership with banking-software company Oradian to use Stellar platform in its core banking software for microfinance institutions (MFI), with an eye toward using digital-currency based payments networks to improve the ability of financiers to work with each other. Since launching Stellar in July 2014, the team behind it \u2013 led by Mr. McCaleb, who previously founded both Mt. Gox and Ripple \u2013 has been busy managing its growth and looking for different uses of its protocol. In looking at the world of the unbanked and the microfinance industry, they think they found a good use. Microfinance is a field pioneered by Dr. Mohammad Yunus in Bangladesh in the 1970s. The idea behind it is to extend banking services on a very small level to people in emerging markets who don\u2019t have the resources to tap the traditional banking services. The industry has grown to the point where about 190 million families are currently served by microfinance, according to the World Bank. But it\u2019s not exactly a modernized industry. Physical security is an issue, and the growth of the industry itself has stretched its ability to operate efficiently. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for microfinance companies to communicate with each other,\u201d said Joyce Kim, executive director at the Stellar Development Foundation. The combined Oradian/Stellar product would allow microfinance companies to quickly send money to each other. \u201cThere\u2019s something like 100,000 microfinance institutions, how do we connect them? How do they get the kinds of efficiencies that will change their lives?\u201d The partnership is going to move slowly, beginning with a pilot program in Nigeria, where moving money often physically carrying cash on a 12-hour bus ride. Stellar could, obviously, change that dynamic. (Paul Vigna) - Nathan Lands thinks that he\u2019s come up with bitcoin\u2019s proverbial killer app.\xa0Mr. Lands, just 30, and his business partner William Cotton have come up with what they hope will be a user-friendly product that will give people an easy way to access and utilize the blockchain. It\u2019s called Blockai (\u201cThe idea is it\u2019s an \u2018eye\u2019 into the blockchain,\u201d he said) and the duo hopes it does for bitcoin among the general public what Netscape did for the Internet, which is to be the first product that was broadly accessible to the general public. Becoming the Netscape of the blockchain is a lofty goal, and plenty of competitors are aiming at the same target, but it\u2019s one upon which Mr. Lands\u2019 has been fixated. This is his second stab at the killer app. He launched QuickCoin in 2014, which was a program that nestled inside Facebook\u2019s platform, and allowed users to send small amounts of bitcoin to their friends. The app got a flurry of attention at the outset, but it never really took off. Mr. Lands gleaned something from that failure, though. \u201cCash works fine,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be other, unique reasons to use bitcoin.\u201d In capitalizing on the promise of the blockchain, he thinks that he\u2019s found that unique reason. \u201cReally, the blockchain at its core is the world\u2019s first reliable public database.\u201d That gives users an opportunity to upload anything from a simple message to a friend to a work of art or a legal document, and use bitcoin\u2019s currency to monetize that asset. What Blockai seeks to do is become the easy-to-use platform that facilitates that. The team is working on the beta version now \u2013 perfecting the desktop version, building a mobile app \u2013 and doing the rounds on the fund-raising circuit. Mr. Lands expects to launch the product broadly in the next two or three months. \u201cNetscape took regular people into the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to do the same thing for the blockchain.\u201d (Paul Vigna) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/02/28/bitbeat-stellar-takes-a-step-into-the-microfinance-world/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 28, 10, 38), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: Stellar Takes a Step Into the Microfinance World'}, {'articleText': u' Investors looking to bet on the future of digital currency could soon have an equity vehicle for doing so, courtesy of a penny stock reverse merger that should see bitcoin derivative trading platform Tera Exchange become a listed company. Tera Group Inc. announced earlier Friday that it has entered into a merger agreement with MGT Capital Investments, a New York Stock Exchange-listed company that runs online gaming sites. Under the terms of the deal, Tera will take a controlling stake in MGT, which will issue common stock shares worth 70% of its pro form equity to Tera\u2019s owners. MGT, which has a market capitalization of $5.2 million, was last quoted at $0.70, up 36% on the day. In September, Tera became the first regulated platform for bitcoin derivatives, when the Commodities Futures Trading Commission approved its platform, which uses the proprietary TeraBit Index as a dollar/bitcoin price benchmark for managing swap contract execution. Swaps on the Tera platform are settled in dollars, which means that traders need not have direct ownership of bitcoins to participate. The development of swaps and options trading in bitcoin is considered by many as a critical step in taming the sometimes wild volatility in the bitcoin market, as these hedging vehicles allow traders to offset risks of exchange rate losses. \xa0A smoother price is in turn seen as a necessary prerequisite for enticing more people and businesses to use and accept bitcoin as a means of payment and value transfer. Since its launch, Tera\u2019s platform has seen over a million \u201cindications of interest,\u201d or bids and offers, though only a very small number of those have resulted in executed trades, said CEO Christian Martin. \xa0That divergence, he said, reflected the price discovery process that\u2019s inevitable in a very new marketplace with no historical references for building consensus around the valuation of differently timed swap contracts. Mr. Martin, who has spent 25 years in emerging-market trading environments, said this was akin to the early days of the credit-default swap market. Back then, \u201cpeople were starting to develop a use case and when the use case was developed then you got liquidity, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at with the bitcoin community.\u201d Tera\u2019s products are marketed to institutional investors. Currently, its clients include bitcoin payment processors, exchanges and insurers, along with a few hedge funds and other investment institutions. Mr. Martin said that the company hopes to benefit reputationally from being the first bitcoin exchange with a public U.S. listing and that this status should help it raise capital for future operations. The Tera team is as yet undecided what to do about MGT\u2019s legacy gaming operations, he said, acknowledging \u201cthere are synergies\u201d with the bitcoin business. He added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to review all of that together [with the MGT management] and decided whether that is an asset that has more value broken up or if it has more value in itself.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $237.71, down 0.4% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin security company BitGo has secured a theft insurance policy attached to its proprietary multi-signature wallet protection service, a first for the digital currency industry that could pave the way for companies to provide greater assurances to customers that their bitcoins are safe. According to an announcement Wednesday, A-rated insurer XL Group will provide comprehensive protection so that any paying BitGo enterprise customer is automatically eligible to insure theft claims up to $250,000 and to increase that coverage by paying a flat 1% fee. BitGo CEO Will O\u2019Brien said the process took nine months for XL\u2019s examiners to vet BitGo\u2019s \u201cmulti-sig\u201d system for bitcoin wallets, which assigns multiple private keys, or passwords, to different entities and so makes it much harder for a hacker to take control of the wallet. Multi-sig systems can be described as a digital equivalent of the dual-key processes used to unlock safety deposit boxes, much like those used at Swiss private banks. In BitGo\u2019s case, its software is marketed to firms such as bitcoin exchanges and digital-currency investment managers and pitched as way to give their retail customers both personal control over their assets and added security. Unlike other policies secured by wallet providers, which cover the bitcoins themselves, BitGo\u2019s policy from XL essentially insures the technology. Mr. O\u2019Brien argued that this would create a \u201cscalable platform\u201d to help the wider bitcoin industry attract customers who\u2019ve otherwise been leery of the security risks associated with the digital currency. A string of bitcoin hacking attacks \u2013 notably, that which destroyed Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox last year and January\u2019s breach at Slovenia-based Bitstamp \u2014 as well as associations with criminality, have helped foster an impression of insecurity around bitcoin in the public eye. But those events have also given impetus to BitGo, with the company seeking to establish a set of standards around its model for the industry.\xa0 After Bitstamp temporarily ceased operations in January to address the hack on its operational, or \u201chot,\u201d wallet, it enlisted the help of BitGo to get back up and running with a multi-sig infrastructure. In designing the XL insurance program, BitGo tapped the services of Ty Sagalow, a 30-year insurance veteran and former chief operating officer of AIG\u2019s e-business risk insurance business who now operates his own consultancy, the Innovation Insurance Group. Mr. Sagalow described a lengthy process of convincing XL to underwrite an operation in a bitcoin industry that \u201cis not only new but also has a history that would be worrisome to the insurance industry.\u201d But in the end, he said, XL realized the potential and reach of a deal that represents \u201ca watershed event not only for the bitcoin industry but for the insurance industry.\u201d Other bitcoin service providers have sought to provide in-house assurances to customers of their security of their funds, some of which include promises of insurance. San Francisco-based wallet and custodial services provider Xapo recently expanded its security operations to upgrade its own proprietary multi-sig process and so-called \u201cdeep-cold storage\u201d of the private password keys used to unlock bitcoin transactions. Taking the idea of a \u201ccold wallet\u201d \u2013 where the keys are kept offline, away from the prying eyes of hackers \u2013 to another level, Xapo uses underground vaults in refurbished nuclear bunkers in Switzerland and other places to store keys on servers that will never touch the Internet and to create a system of transaction execution that leaves no trace of their use in an online setting. On the strength of this security, Xapo offers its clients insurance. However, its policy is underwritten according to a \u201ccaptive insurance\u201d model, which limits its liability to the capital that the company itself commits to the coverage. Other wallet, exchange and custodial services providers that employ sophisticated security protections, including Circle Internet Financial and Coinbase, offer their customers differing degrees of insurance as well.

Bitcoin, the six-year-old fledgling cryptocurrency with an\xa0image problem, will be getting a makeover. \xa0Unless you\u2019re familiar with social-media stars like Julia Kelly, Jorden Keith, and Acacia Brinley, though, it\u2019s going to be an ad campaign unlike any you\u2019re used to. A consortium of bitcoin insiders, including the Bitcoin Foundation, BitFury, BitGo and Tally Capital,\xa0hired avante garde ad agency TheAudience\xa0to rebuild the currency\u2019s reputation among the general public. The goal is pretty standard: highlight bitcoin\u2019s positive aspects \u2013 its potential to help the \u201cunbanked,\u201d for instance \u2013 and get people to forget about Mt. Gox and Silk Road. \u201cWe need to highlight the opportunity of bitcoin, we need to educate people on what it is,\u201d said Oliver Luckett, the firm\u2019s CEO, sounding as passionate about it as any bitcoin evangelist. What\u2019s different is how the firm will go about achieving that goal. There have been very brief efforts at bitcoin ads. BitPay, the merchant-services firm, bought a U.S. college football bowl sponsorship. The \u201cBitcoin Bowl\u201d (the company boldly chose to use not its name but the currency\u2019s) put the name before millions of sporting fans; the company\xa0ran ads during the game, too\xa0(which North Carolina State\xa0won, 34-27,\xa0over the University of Central Florida). What is different is how TheAudience plans to go about selling that message. The firm, founded in 2011 by a threesome of Mr. Luckett, a former Walt Disney executive, super-agent Ari Emanuel, and Naspter co-founder Sean Parker, doesn\u2019t just create spots and buy ad space. The firm taps a network of social-media stars \u2013 some call them microcelebrities, Mr. Luckett prefers to call them influencers \u2013 to tout products on their own networks, their YouTube or Vine channels. This campaign from TheAudience will feature social-media stars like, for example, Ms. Brinley (none of the firm\u2019s stable of online stars have been specifically tied to the bitcoin campaign),\xa0who would incorporate the product, in this case bitcoin, into their work they produce online, maybe a mention of it, or a photo on Instagram. Social-media stars like Ms. Brinley aren\u2019t a household name in the way that, say, a show like The Simpsons is. But she does have 640,000 followers on Twitter, 530,ooo on YouTube, and 1.7 million on Instagram (moreover, those followers \u2013 online, tech savvy, millennials \u2013 also happen to be a perfect target audience for an online currency). \u201cThese influencers are the key,\u201d Mr. Luckett said, and while he touts this method as new, it\u2019s really just the platform that\u2019s new. He compared this kind of collaboration between artist and brand to the earliest days of radio and television, when companies would sponsors shows like soap operas, which got their name because the sponsors were soap and detergent companies. The microcelebrity names may not resonant like Peyton Manning, who\u2019s made an entire second career out of being a pitchman, but these are powerful channels TheAudience is tapping. \u201cThey can push a button and 8 million people will sit down to watch their content,\u201d Mr. Luckett said of his influencers. So, it won\u2019t be \u201cgot bitcoin.\u201d More like\xa0Little Orphan Annie and Ovaltine, and that worked out nicely for both Annie and Ovaltine.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $238.95, up 1.5% (via CoinDesk) -Demand\xa0for services\xa0from digital wallet provider Blockchain has surged over the past six months and much of it has come from the finacially troubled parts of the developing world London-based Blockchain announced Monday that it had passed the milestone of 3 million wallets, having crossed the 2 million mark back in August. According to CEO Peter Smith, that tally refers to \u201cunique users\u201d who are now most rapidly signing up in countries such as Argentina and emerging markets \u201con the periphery of the eurozone,\u201d places where trust in the local financial system has been wracked by crises. In addition, Blockchain announced significant growth in transaction volumes, reporting that over $270 million in bitcoin transactions occurred via its wallets over the past seven days. The company said this is an industry record, and that it represents a 200% increase from the same week a year ago. Mr. Smith said that between 30% and 35% of transactions made via its wallets are \u201centerprise transactions,\u201d where bitcoins are transferred to and from firms such as merchants or exchanges, and the remainder are \u201cpeer-to-peer,\u201d typically involving individuals. Bitcoin wallets, of which Blockchain is one of a number or providers, are the main tool with which users interact with the bitcoin network. Wallet owners use unique passwords known as private keys to send bitcoin to other wallets. Mr. Smith took the opportunity reiterate his company\u2019s case in the long-running debate over whether its model of independent user-controlled wallets is superior to those of custodial companies that manage customers\u2019 personal keys on their behalf on the grounds. Citing the outpaced demand for Blockchain wallets over others\u2019 products in crisis countries such as Argentina, he said, \u201cpeople have really low levels of trust in these markets, and they don\u2019t want to trust people to hold onto their money. They want tools that allow them to manage their own funds.\u201d Arguably, Blockchain also has an advantage over the leading custodial wallet providers, including Coinbase, Circle and Xapo, in that its services are more easily accessed in developing countries, where bitcoin demand growth is strongest. The custodial service providers, which argue that their model gives customers peace of mind against the risk that they lose or forget their private keys, typically also offer them the opportunity to buy bitcoins with dollars. That requires regulatory compliance to a degree that a purely bitcoin-to-bitcoin service doesn\u2019t need to meet. Under Blockchain\u2019s current model, customers are encouraged to purchase bitcoins through a third-party service such as a digital-currency exchange and then to transfer them to their Blockchain wallet. (Michael Casey) UPDATE: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Blockchain wallets had processed $270 million in bitcoin transactions over the past seven weeks. The period of measurement was in fact seven days. - Rakuten, a big Japanese e-commerce retailer, will \u201cprobably\u201d accept bitcoin, an executive said at a financial conference, according to a post in our Japan Real Time blog. It would become one of the biggest companies in Japan to take an interest in the cryptocurrency. \u201cWe are thinking about it, and we will probably do it,\u201d said founder and CEO Hiroshi Miktani. He didn\u2019t offer any specific timetable for such a move. Bitcoin has been growing in Japan, but it\u2019s slower than you might think. The country doesn\u2019t rank in the top 10 in terms of merchant adoption, behind the U.S., several European countries, Canada, Singapore, and Australia. So having Rakuten, which was founded in 1997, and\xa0had 2014 sales of $16.5 billion (2 trillion yen) would be a significant vote of confidence for bitcoin in Japan. It is also another notable recent vote of confidence from a major company, after Dell last week announced that it was expanding its bitcoin acceptance to Canada and the U.K. (Paul Vigna) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/02/23/bitbeat-blockchain-hits-3-million-wallets-fueled-by-developing-world-demand/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 23, 17, 9), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: Blockchain Hits 3 Million Wallets, Fueled By Developing World Demand'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

A lot of companies have dipped a toe into bitcoin, from Overstock.com Inc. to Microsoft Inc. But it hasn\u2019t always been clear how much business the digital currency has brought them. This is a sign that, for Dell at least, the bitcoin option has registered with its customers. The company noted that it\u2019s seen purchases ranging from small-scale purchases of software and peripherals to a $500,000 purchase of a \u201chighly configured\u201d PowerEdge server system. (Paul Vigna) - Ever try to tell the IRS that your return got lost in the mail?\xa0How\u2019d that work for you? Probably not well. The issue of lost tax returns is one that the startup Factom is using to illustrate the potential of its business. The service is building\xa0a data-management business on top of the bitcoin blockchain, and allows users to essentially create a permanent record of, well, their records. The product is still in an early \u201calpha\u201d phase of testing. An initial \u201cbeta\u201d release is planned for the second quarter, which will coincide with a crowdsourced round of fund raising. Factom is one of the more talked-about \u201cbitcoin 2.0\u2033 startups, which all revolve around the idea of using the so-called the blockchain,\xa0bitcoin\u2019s open-ledger record-keeping function, for services apart from moving money. The idea is that anything that can be digitized, from a currency value to a tax return to a note on a house, can be stored in the blockchain. Most of the efforts are in the nascent stages, but this is going to be a hot field as cryptocurrencies develop. Factom used the current tax season to plunk out an example of what its service can do: it embedded the public tax return of President Barack Obama into its chain (as this is still a service in alpha mode, the return wasn\u2019t embedded in the actual blockchain.) \u201cThe point of this exercise, is that the IRS loses people taxes all the time,\u201d said\xa0said Peter Kirby, Factom\u2019s president. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the messy, messy, messy process of governance\u201d when you\u2019re handling millions of documents. Now, it\u2019s highly unlikely that the president\u2019s taxes would ever get lost, but the average Joe may find a utility here. What happens is, a user uploads their data to Factom\u2019s decentralized protocol. At that point, the document is embedded and timestamped. The user shares the private key to that data with the recipient party, in this case, the IRS. When the IRS takes possession, that transaction is timestamped as well. There is no chance the return got lost in the mail, or lost at the IRS. There is no squabbling about what happened to the return. A 2012 lawsuit out of Maine, in which a medical center couldn\u2019t apply for a tax refund because its tax return was literally lost in the mail,\xa0illustrates the point. Because the medical center didn\u2019t get a receipt from the local post office, it couldn\u2019t prove that it had actually filed the return, and the IRS wouldn\u2019t accept its application for a refund. The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the medical center, saying the burden in such a dispute is on the taxpayer to prove that they actually mailed their return.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $219.47, down 1.5% (via CoinDesk) - BitPesa, the Nairobi-based startup that\u2019s taken aim at the global remittance business, announced that it\u2019s raised $1.1 million in a second round of funding led by San Francisco-based Pantera Capital. Dan Morehead, Pantera\u2019s CEO and founder, joined the startup\u2019s board of directors.

Conversely, the U.K. has been more difficult. \u201cIt gives us a hint about where to move next.\u201d The remittance business and emerging markets are one of the most promising fields for cryptocurrencies, at least so far as providing both a legitimate business case and a social good. There are more than two billion people considered \u201cunbanked,\u201d without access to banking services. Anyone with access to a cellphone, however, can potentially access services like BitPesa. It remains a small slice of the overall business \u2013 BitPesa hasn\u2019t yet reached its goal of capturing 1% of the local market. But it is, as Ms. Rossiello pointed out, growing, and receiving funding from the likes of Pantera is a sign that big players in the digital-currency world are taking it seriously. (Paul Vigna) - Our colleagues over at the Journal Reports team are taking an interest in cryptocurrencies. They\u2019re planning to cover the space in a special report that will run in a few weeks (March 2), and as part of that, they\u2019re asking for our \u2013 well, your, really \u2013 help. The team is asking what you think on the issue of cryptocurrencies: do they have a future? While the poll question itself is a yes-or-no question, the poll includes a field for comments, so this is your chance to make your case for, or against, bitcoin and its peers. Here\u2019s their pitch: Few currency topics generate as much excitement\u2013and controversy these days\u2013as Bitcoin. Naysayers argue that cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional currencies which are backed by central banks, have no real underlying value. Others counter that a cryptocurrency\u2019s worth is still what the market says it is\u2014as is true for many forms of investment. These advocates say investors should focus on which cryptocurrencies are widely accepted, which will grow in popularity, and which will collapse. What do you think? Do cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have a future? (Results and excerpted reader comments will be published in a coming WSJ report). Here\u2019s the poll, and they are absolutely encouraging people to write comments.

Hopefully, we\u2019ll return to a more frequent release schedule in coming weeks. The long-awaited revised draft of the New York Department of Financial Services\u2019 so-called \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal for firms engaged in digital currency-related businesses was released late Wednesday. At first glance, Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky appears to have lived up to his promise to pare back some of the more draconian provisions of the first draft that attracted much criticism from bitcoiners. Yet neither did he give them everything they wanted. The new draft includes an exemption from having to obtain a license for software developers that aren\u2019t engaged directly in money transmission or exchange. It also offers the prospect of a softer regulatory touch for small startups \u2013 a clear acknowledgment that innovation shouldn\u2019t be stifled \u2013 and takes a far less strict position on reporting requirements. But although some leading lights in digital currency land gave it a cautious welcome, it\u2019s clear that many still worry Mr. Lawsky\u2019s proposal could overly constrain innovation in this nascent industry. In a blog post responding to the release, Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburgh of the Washington think tank Coin Center said \u201cthe NYDFS has shown a willingness to embrace criticism that should be celebrated by the Bitcoin community.\u201d However, they added, \u201cthere is much that can still be improved in the new draft proposal.\u201d (The Center also included a useful marked-up document showing how the proposal has changed.) In particular, Coin Center team took issue with the idea that exemptions for startups would be subject to the discretion of the superintendent, rather than defined by a clearer set of standards. They argued that, as written, it creates regulatory uncertainty surrounding the whim or replacement of government officials. Messrs. Brito and Van Valkenburgh also noted that issuers of decentralized currency, of which bitcoin itself is one, might not be exempt from licensing requirements under a rule that would cover institutions \u201ccontrolling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency.\u201d \xa0They ask: \u201cIf one read this section to apply to decentralized currencies, would mining be considered \u201cadministering\u201d the currency?\u201d Barry Silbert, the CEO of New York-based Digital Currency Group, shared Coin Center\u2019s concerns about the discretionary aspect to the exemptions. He said the new proposal is a \u201cstep in the right direction, but there is still work to be done\u201d as it continues to place \u201csignificant burdens on digital currency firms of all sizes without a clear \u2018on-ramp\u2019 for startups.\u201d Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of Boston-based bitcoin consumer services company Circle, similarly welcomed the new proposal in principle, saying it would bring it \u201cone step closer to being a template framework that regulators globally will consider as Bitcoin is integrated into the global financial system. \u201c However, he criticized a continued provision that companies notify and get approval for any new product feature.\xa0 \u201cThis cuts deeply against the grain of agile, internet based software innovation, and is nearly inconceivable,\u201d Mr. Allaire said. \u201cInternet technology companies deploy new features into products on a daily or weekly basis.\u201d Additionally, reporting requirements on \u201cchange of control or control persons\u201d\xa0 could be an onerous requirement for highly innovative companies for which venture capital-raising is an ongoing and rapidly changing process. Indeed, it will be interesting to see how Silicon Valley\u2019s influential band of venture-capital investors in bitcoin respond to that latter provision, which some fear could stymie fundraising. David Berger, CEO of the New York-based Digital Currency Council, was more encouraged, however. He welcomed, in particular, the new exemption for non-financial activities built on bitcoin\u2019s so-called blockchain ledger, a reference to those cases where only a nominal amount of digital currency is used, typically for purely functional rather than financial purposes. \u201cIt appears aimed to ensure that the BitLicense does not stifle the innovative applications of the blockchain beyond currency, many of which are just emerging or yet to emerge.\u201d A month-long comment period now begins.\xa0(Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

We\u2019ve been hearing from our sources for some time now that Wall Street\u2019s taken an interest in bitcoin, but it\u2019s always been sideline chatter. A VC from Silicon Valley breezes into town and meets with some bankers. Analysts relate conversations they\u2019re hearing and having. With the news today, it appears Wall Street\u2019s sending a message about the future of digital currencies. It\u2019s been building slowly. The first tangible sign that bitcoin might have a life on the street came when Bloomberg chose to add price quotes to its terminals. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission asserted its authority over bitcoin trading, and bitcoin exchange TeraExchange sought the CFTC\u2019s approval when it offered a bitcoin swap. And, of course, there\u2019s\xa0Benjamin Lawsky, the\xa0superintendent\xa0of the New York State Department of Financial Services, whose \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal will bring some regulation to bitcoin. So it seems \u201cthe Street,\u201d that metonym for the broad financial sector, has been perking its ears up regarding bitcoin for some time, and that this new development did not come out of the blue. Tom Glocer, the former Thomson Reuters CEO who was a participant in the fund raising, said he\u2019d never heard of Wall Street making bitcoin investments before, but that it made sense. When he ran Thomson Reuters, he noted, the firm had a greenhouse fund to invest in new businesses. \u201cNot to make money, but to make sure you understand and get first dibs to apply new technology.\u201d That appears to be what\u2019s happening now. In its press release about the deal, financial firm BBVA Group echoed that thought when it described why it decided to invest in this funding round. \u201cCoinbase touches the most important aspects of that emerging ecosystem, giving it one of the best viewports into new developments and applications for the technology.\u201d A number of backers these days in fact seems to have shifted their gaze away from the price, which has fallen more than 80% from its peak. Mr. Glocer said said was less interested in bitcoin itself, and \u201cmore interested in the underlying blockchain technology, and what you can do with it.\u201d The services that Coinbase offers, and the promise of the blockchain, he said, \u201cwould work just as well with a biteuro, bitdollar, or bityen.\u201d That gets to the heart of the matter, really. When people say they\u2019re more interested in the technology behind bitcoin than bitcoin itself, what they\u2019re really saying is that if the technology can work for bitcoin, it could work for any currency. Indeed, Coinbase and several other services providers\u2013Circle comes to mind, as does BitReserve\u2013specifically set up their products to minimize the emphasis on bitcoin. What Coinbase is working on now, Mr. Armstrong told us, is expanding, both geographically and in its services offerings. It launched an updated mobile app, and is focused on building up its mobile-money business. Mr. Armstrong talked about India, and the potential there to tap into the nearly 1 billion cellphone users. The firm\u2019s also focused on its API platform. \u201cWe\u2019re building the infrastructure of bitcoin,\u201d he said, comparing the activity in the industry now to the early days of the Internet, and the web-hosting services that allowed people to easily get online. That is, apparently, an argument that went over well with Wall Street.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $217.80, up 23% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin prices are back up, and watching them do their imitation of a seismograph this past week\xa0reminded us of two previously unrelated comments we collected last spring from bitcoin believers that seemed relatively innocuous at the time. Now they seem prescient, and offer some insight into what\u2019s happening with the price. Last spring, we were interviewing Laszlo Hanyecz, the Florida programmer famous for initiating the first purchase of a product using bitcoin, when he made an offhand comment about the price. \u201cI think the price is artificially inflated,\u201d he said. We took it down in our notes, but never made reference to it. Didn\u2019t seem significant. The second comment, also in the spring, came from Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist at New York brokerage Convergex, who\u2019s taken an interest in bitcoin. Toward the end of an interview with him, he said that for bitcoin\u2019s sake, he hoped that they held off offering options trading and other derivative products as long as possible. Why? We asked. \u201cBecause,\u201d he said, \u201cright now, there\u2019s no way to short it.\u201d When bitcoin\u2019s price plummeting sharply over the weekend, amid a lot of talk about market manipulation, these comments came back to us, and it occurs to us that what you\u2019re seeing in bitcoin trading right now is a messy transition from a rudimentary, limited market structure to one a more developed market with more options \u2013 but without any of the safeguards that protect traditional investors. \u201cThe introduction of margin trading may be one of the causes of the recent price drop we have seen in bitcoin,\u201d Pantera Capital wrote in a morning note. \u201cIncreased use of leverage in the bitcoin market, both on the long- and short-side, has likely increased the magnitude of price moves.\u201d Pantera noted that short positions had hit an all-time high over the past few days, \u201cas shorts try to take advantage of the price drop and the forced selling to liquidate leveraged long positions.\u201d The total number of active bitcoin swaps, instruments that can be used to bet on price swings, has jumped from around 5,000 in December to about 25,000 currently, Pantera said. The first swap to trade on a regulated exchange didn\u2019t happen until October, on TeraExchange, a platform that registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Others,\xa0like SolidX, have been raising funds to build a swaps business as well. The argument is that these kinds of products will bring in more investors, and liquidity. For now, it\u2019s creating more volatility. Even up into late 2013, bitcoin was the ultimate binary trade: you either bought, or you sold. There was no way to bet on where you thought the price might be going, or to bet against bitcoin. Even selling wasn\u2019t really betting against the price; if you sold, you were only selling to somebody interested in buying.\xa0That led to what was essentially a one-way trade in an illiquid market. That structure fed into the wild price spike, which topped out around $1,150. But in the last year, a variety of options have opened up, including leveraged bets that magnify the gains and losses of traders and options bets that allow investors to put money on a decline. At the same, time, this is still a thin, thin market, giving anybody looking to move the price a bigger target to hit. Trying to move, say, the U.S. equities market by buying futures on the S&P 500 is expensive. Trying to move bitcoin is far cheaper. Bitcoin exchanges, however, do not have any of the kinds of rules that equities exchanges do. There are no uptick rules. There are no circuit breakers. Not only is bitcoin virtually unregulated, it\u2019s highly automated, and there\u2019s some evidence that traders are shorting bitcoin, then flooding the market with automated sell orders to drive the price down. It all leads to the conclusion that bitcoin has not yet shed its Wild West days. \xa0(Paul Vigna) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/01/15/bitbeat-as-price-surges-bitcoins-wild-west-days-come-alive-again/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 15, 13, 14), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: As Price Surges, Bitcoin&rsquo;s Wild West Days Come Alive Again'}, {'articleText': u' Bitcoin is getting hammered in markets that trade the digital currency, prompting providers of its core computing infrastructure to shut down operations. The selloff, which appears to have been exacerbated when Asian traders were forced to meet collateral demands under margin trading rules, left bitcoin down 14.49% at $194.04 in the late New York morning Wednesday, following a 15.02% plunge Tuesday, according to news service Coindesk. The digital currency is now down 39% from Dec. 31 alone and is off 83% from the all-time high of $1,165 that it hit at the end of a furious rally in November 2013. That price decline is creating something of a mini-crisis in the business of bitcoin mining, the vital process through which new bitcoins are added to the money supply. Working within a network of independent computers, bitcoin miners are tasked with confirming transactions initiated by users of the digital currency and compete to solve a mathematical puzzle in order to be compensated for that work with newly issued bitcoins. As the price of bitcoin falls against the dollar and other fiat currencies, it induces miners to shut down operations, because they can no longer cover costs such as equipment, rent and electricity quoted in those traditional currencies. The problem was made more acute by what had been a yearlong, exponential buildup in mining infrastructure \u2013 machines comprised of highly specialized, super-powerful computers \u2013 which made competition for bitcoins tougher. Bitcoin\u2019s core software algorithm periodically adjusts the difficulty of its mathematical puzzle to keep it in line with the amount of computing power in the network. That way, new bitcoin payouts are kept to more or less a 10-minute schedule regardless of how well equipped the miners are to solve the puzzle. On Monday, CEX.io, a company that mines bitcoins on behalf of clients that rent out its computing power, announced that it would temporarily halt this \u201ccloud mining\u201d operation, citing \u201cthe recent bitcoin price drop, as well as the upscaling of the mining difficulty.\u201d And on Tuesday, CoinTerra Inc. confirmed that it had been forced to default on a bond payment after being shut out of a Utah data center in which it had run a bitcoin mining operation that once accounted for around 3% of the total bitcoin network. The facility owner, C7 Data Centers Inc., has sued it for non-payment of fees. These and other developments have for the first time led to an unprecedented sustained decline in the hashrate, a metric that measures the overall computational power of the total bitcoin mining network, and for the first time, a downward adjustment in the algorithm\u2019s difficulty function. Over the prior year the hashrate had increased 30-fold to the point the total computational capacity of the network was 13,000 times that of the world\u2019s 500 largest supercomputers combined. The mining exodus and falling hashrate, along with last week\u2019s hacking attack that suspended trading at Slovenia-based bitcoin exchange Bitstamp, have fed investor fears and led many to cash out, says Greg Schvey, a partner at bitcoin market analytics firm, TradeBlock. That selling was exacerbated in Asian trading, where exchanges such as Hong Kong-based Bitfinex allow leveraged-based margin trading and where automated margin calls were triggered once the price fell below levels at which those traders are required to post more collateral. This led to automated waves of selling. But, Mr. Schvey added, the market \u201cis getting to the point where it finds an economic equilibrium,\u201d with enough mining operators exiting to boost the market share of those who remain. He compared the scenario to oil markets, where drillers are only now responding, belatedly, to falling crude prices by shutting off rigs and leaving a larger market share to those who can still afford to produce. Gavin Andresen, who as the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s Chief Scientist leads a team of mostly volunteer software developers who maintain bitcoin\u2019s core code, said he\u2019s not worried about depleting the mining stock, known as hashing power. \u201cA lot of hashing power is not going away,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who basically have free power and who are running industrial miners that they are going keep running no matter what the price.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

As we\u2019ve argued elsewhere, we don\u2019t think the price is a reasonable gauge of the prospects for cryptocurrency technology\u2019s future, mostly because the currency itself is of secondary importance in many of that technology\u2019s future applications. That said, there are some important questions about what the price decline means for that most vital of activities within the bitcoin ecosystem: mining. The profitability of mining, which is crucial to bitcoin because it is the means by which transactions are confirmed and new bitcoins are brought into being, is highly \xa0sensitive to bitcoin\u2019s price in dollars. \xa0In theory, then, as that price falls, it should discourage new entrants into the business and encourage existing operators to leave. Despite this direct link, the sharp price decline of 2014 coincided with a remarkable 30-fold surge in the hashrate \u2013 the main measure of the size and power of the bitcoin mining network \u2013 which brought bitcoin\u2019s aggregate computational power to a level 13,000 times that of the combined clout of the world\u2019s 500 biggest supercomputers. Now, finally, the hashrate is falling amid signs that miners are turning off rigs. That in turn will have a counterbalancing effect because a lower hashrate means that bitcoin\u2019s software adjusts down the in-built difficulty function that determines how much computational work, or hashing, a miner must undertake to solve the system\u2019s key mathematical puzzle that earns rights to new bitcoins. A lower hashrate equals softer competitive pressure. But before we get to that it\u2019s worth pondering why we saw last year\u2019s counterintuitive hashrate increase. Firstly, let\u2019s acknowledge that both the bitcoin price and mining network experienced extreme bubbles \u2014 the currency in 2013, mining last year. Each bubble fed off the other in powerful but different ways, but in the latter case with time delays reflected a classic failure of synchronization between financial markets, which react to news instantaneously, and contractually bound capital investments in land, plant and equipment, for which change occurs much more slowly. We see this now in the delays with which oil drillers are shutting down rigs even though crude oil\u2019s 55% price decline from mid-2014 has rendered many unable to pay their debts. As bitcoin\u2019s priced surged 8,000% to $1,100 in the 12 months to December 2013, mining investors saw a chance to get rich. They built out warehouse-based operations with rows and rows of fast-paced rigs that used ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) chips to launch the newest thing: cloud mining. This was a new service for small players to participate in the otherwise competitively difficult business of mining by buying contracts that give them shares in big, efficiently run facilities\u2019 aggregate hashing power. Those contracts locked cloud mining companies into long-term customer commitments, as did their lease contracts with data centers and the purchase contracts they had with suppliers of ASIC chips and rigs. So through much of 2013 they kept building out facilities, even as the falling price of bitcoin meant that both the companies and their clients were losing money. There was also a natural incentive to double down as the hashing power and efficiency of new chips and rigs relentlessly improved. As Ravi Iyengar, CEO of cloud mining and mining equipment maker CoinTerra, explained during a visit to one of their operations in Utah last year, his company could price its 12-month contracts at cost but still make money adding more efficient rigs to CoinTerra\u2019s total hashing complex. The same logic, applied across numerous cloud mining companies no doubt induced them to keep investing in new rigs, which perpetually increased the network hashrate. Balaji Srinivasan, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, argued that this relentless investment in new equipment had a secondary, negative effect on the bitcoin price as mining companies sold their digital currency holdings to pay for their chip and equipment purchases in dollars. Now this vicious cycle seems to be ending, mostly as cloud miners throw in the towel. On Monday, bitcoin mining and exchange provider CEX.IO said it would temporarily suspend cloud mining services, in part because of \u201cthe recent bitcoin price drop.\u201d This among, other signs of trouble in cloud mining \u2013 notably at CoinTerra, which is now facing a lawsuit from the same datacenter provider and has been shut out of that facility \u2014 suggests the falling price has pushed the industry, finally, into a tipping point. As such, the hashrate appears not only to have stabilized but is falling. Whether this also signals the end of the painful price retraction is another question. UPDATE: The \u201cLatest Price\u201d portion of this post has been updated to show the price was down, not up.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $315.08, up 1.7% (via CoinDesk) - Barring some insane rally or plunge, the price of a bitcoin is going to end the year down sharply from its price one year ago. Bitcoin ended 2013 at $757 \u2013 nearly 60% higher than Wednesday\u2019s price of around $315. It\u2019s off even farther from the December 2013 all-time high of $1,147. But as we\u2019ve argued, the price of bitcoin isn\u2019t really the most important measure of its impact. The number of merchants that accept it has risen sharply, and some of the biggest names in the corporate world have dipped a toe in the cryptocurrency waters, including Dell Inc. and Microsoft Also, the amount of venture-capital money going toward bitcoin startups more than tripled in 2014, from about $93 million a year ago to $315 million this year. (Still a pittance for the VC industry, which poured more than $4 billion into Uber and Xiaomi.) Also, as opposed to markets in the Russian ruble and crude oil, where the respective crashes have investors and citizens chewing their nails, we have yet to run into anybody in the bitcoin world who\u2019s concerned about the price collapse. Strip out the October-December 2013 price spike, and the currency is still on a multi-year upswing. It is too soon to declare that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are here to stay, though. Mobile payments seem like a hot topic for the new year, but it\u2019s going to be a crowded, competitive space. Bitcoin, for all the publicity it\u2019s gotten, still comes off as a very techie, geeky product. Nobody has yet come up with that mass-market app that will make it truly accessible to the public. In the meantime, Apple has jumped in with its Apple Pay mobile wallet, and Alibaba Inc. has its wildly successful Alipay offering. Those are two formidable competitors. Still, if 2014 wasn\u2019t exactly the Year of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency did gain a certain level of mainstream acceptance. \u201cThis is the first step in a journey,\u201d Scott McAllister, senior vice president of digital marketing and revenue at Time, told MoneyBeat, after the media company started accepting bitcoin for four of its titles. He was speaking of the company\u2019s efforts, but it\u2019s not a bad way to think of the bitcoin economy overall. After all, paper money is nearly 1,000 years old. Bitcoin is just over six years old. It\u2019s not even old enough to have an \u201cauld lang syne\u201d yet. Maybe someday it gets there. (Paul Vigna) - Corporate America isn\u2019t alone in its interest in bitcoin. The Big Apple is getting curious as well.\xa0The city\u2019s Department of Finance released a request for information on mobile payments systems that could possibly be used as a replacement for its antiquated parking-ticket payment systems. The department collects $550-$600 million annually, and is interested in a system that would be cheaper for both itself and the people tagged with those tickets. The city stressed that at this point it is looking for information only, \u201cto identify and assess mobile platforms that support the payment of parking tickets and learn about their current use and future viability.\u201d The request mentioned by name credit cards, ACH transfers, and \u201calternative payment methods, such as bitcoin, Apple Pay, PayPal, etc.\u201d MarketWatch\u2019s Jennifer Booton wrote about the proposal, and dropped in on the MoneyBeat show this morning to talk about it.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $313.17, down 1.1% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin got introduced to the sports world on Friday, with the inaugural Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl. The game featured a commanding performance from the North Carolina State Wolfpack, who took control in the second half and thumped the University of Central Florida Knights, 34-27.\xa0It was a bit surreal watching the cryptocurrency mingle with college football fans, and it led to things like this\xa0local news segment that tried to explain bitcoin. College football fans and bitcoin fans are both lively groups, and the whole event seemed pretty festive. Bitcoin enthusiasts used the virtual currency to snap up more than 300 travel packages to the contest, said Ashley Wheeler, the coordinator for the game. Organizers also arranged a special option that allowed tickets to be purchased with bitcoin before general sales to the dollar-wielding public. More than 100 merchants in the area were accepting bitcoin around the time of the game, Ms. Wheeler said. But for bitcoiners \u2013 and BitPay, which bought a three-year sponsorship \u2013 victory won\u2019t be determined by the score after 60 minutes, but rather by how widely bitcoin\u2019s acceptance grows among consumers. At this point in time, it appears that merchants are running ahead of consumers in jumping on board. Buying the naming rights was a clever marketing play on the part of BitPay (which also ran a few of its own commercials during the broadcast, see below). We\u2019d love to know just how many of the more than 3 million people watching Friday night\u2019s game\xa0actually knew what bitcoin was, and how many not only knew but were bitcoin holders themselves. Here\u2019s one of the three commercials BitPay ran during the broadcast:  Indeed, Bitcoin still remains a small part of the overall payments pie, and determining its exact size is difficult.\xa0There is no reliable measure of how many bitcoin transactions are going toward payments. The number of overall bitcoin transaction has steadily been rising, currently in a range roughly between 80,000-100,000 per day. However, given the encrypted nature of bitcoin transactions, it is impossible to tell what the transactions are covering. Trading, legal ecommerce and dark-web/black market sales are probably the three big categories, but we don\u2019t know the percentages. What we do know is that about 76,000 merchants as of September accepted bitcoin for payments, according to CoinDesk, a number that will surely rise at year\u2019s end. In the past year, a number of increasingly larger companies have tipped a toe in the water, from Overtstock.com Inc. in January to Microsoft Corp. this month, with Expedia, Dell Inc., CheapAir.com and Dish Network in between. Most merchants, and the major bitcoin-services firms like BitPay, have declined to release concrete sales data. CheapAir has booked roughly $2.3 million worth of sales in bitcoin, CEO Jeff Klee told MoneyBeat. On a dollar amount, that\u2019s about 2% of its overall business; going by the number of transactions, it\u2019s about 1% of the company\u2019s business. Overstock reportedly will do about $3 million in bitcoin sales this year, below its earlier estimates. \u201cGenerally speaking, we\u2019re really happy with it,\u201d Mr. Klee said. He said the experiment has exceeded the company\u2019s expectations, and it has brought them \u201ca lot of new customers who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have known about us.\u201d \u201cAs a merchant, I can\u2019t say enough good things about bitcoin.\u201d Paul Walsh, the chief investment officer at Dell, said via email that the firm was\xa0\u201cpleased by the response to our current Bitcoin pilot on Dell.com,\u201d \xa0Mr. Walsh said the company expected initially to see mainly consumers using bitcoin, but instead has seen customers of all sizes using it. The company is not releasing sales data, but did note that its largest bitcoin sale came on a \u201chighly configured\u201d $50,000 PowerEdge server system. \u201cThis form of payment is clearly resonating with consumer, small- and medium-businesses,\u201d he wrote. BitPay counts 50,000 merchants as its customers \u2013 including Microsoft \u2013 up from only about 10,000 at the start of the year. Landing one of the biggest companies in the world as a customer, chief commercial officer Sonny Singh said, means bitcoin has gone mainstream. \u201cMicrosoft officially crossed the chasm with that.\u201d Apart from a company like, says, Chevron, \u201ceveryone should be okay with taking bitcoin.\u201d Let\u2019s see where we are after next year\u2019s Bowl game.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$311.48, down 2.41% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013The most striking thing about Benjamin M. Lawsky\u2019s speech today weren\u2019t the sweeping amendments to the New York Department of Financial Services\u2019 original BitLicense proposal\xa0\u2013 though those were truly significant and\xa0generally welcomed by the bitcoin community\xa0\xa0\u2013 but the context in which he framed his comments. The New York Superintendent of Financial Services seemed determined to put his stamp on the idea that digital currencies have a future, one that could, once the technology gets through its teething problems, force the legacy payments and banking systems to innovate in order to survive. Here\u2019s how he framed it. Virtual currency could have the potential to force the existing, legacy payments system to up its game in a significant way. It is, of course, important not to be Pollyannaish about these types of things \u2013 as is sometimes the tendency among tech evangelists. Virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are a very, very long way from being a credible challenger to banks or the existing payments system. (Though the imprimatur of financial regulation will probably help.) But I think virtual currency could eventually cause some amount of self-reflection in the legacy financial system. And it may even cause some banks to confront the Blockbuster Video problem. The problem [is] that in an age of heightened consumer expectations for real-time, digital payments, if banks fail to innovate, they could eventually face a real challenge. A Blockbuster comparison\u2026 \xa0There are a lot of bitcoiners feeling vindicated by those remarks.\xa0(Michael Casey) \xa0 \u2013We reached out to Jim Harper for his thoughts on Mr. Lawsky\u2019s address and in the process heard something that seems to have mostly slipped below people\u2019s radar: Mr. Harper has left the Bitcoin Foundation. The move seems linked to the Foundation\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d toward promoting core software development for bitcoin and away from the kind of public policy issues that Mr. Harper was handling in his position as its Global Policy Counsel. Mr. Harper, who remains a fellow at libertarian think tank The Cato Institute, reserved comment on the change. After all, he is still running for a seat on the Foundation\u2019s board, where he hopes to convince its members of the continued importance of the foundation\u2019s public advocacy work. In late October, Patrick Murck succeeded Jon Matonis as the foundation\u2019s executive director and moved to shift the Foundation\u2019s mission to software development. The following month, Mr. Harper\xa0penned a blog post\xa0on what he clearly saw as the flaws of a narrow concentration. It was entitled \u201cA Foundation that can Walk and Chew Gum at the Same Time.\u201d Asked about Mr. Harper\u2019s departure, Mr. Murck said, \u201cthe foundation has shifted focus; policy work is not a priority now and our focus is on supporting bitcoin core development.\u201d He said \u201cJim did a great job\u201d but that with the Bitcoin Foundation having \u201cblazed a trail\u201d in terms of \u201clegitimizing bitcoin in the minds of regulators\u201d it\u2019s now time for \u201cothers to follow\u201d the trail it blazed. Mr. Murck noted that agencies such as the newly created Coin Center think tank in Washington and the Chamber of Digital Commerce are filling that public advocacy role, as are the independent chapters of the Bitcoin Foundation in other countries. As for Mr. Harper\u2019s view of Mr. Lawsky\u2019s speech, on a day in which most bitcoiners were enthusiastic he brought some caution to the mood. The Cato fellow said the New York Department of Financial Services has still not followed through on a promise to make public the analysis that led to the BitLicense draft. It\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d that it do so, he said, so that people can assess what kind of risks the regulators perceive to exist with digital currencies and determine \u201cwhat problems it seeks to solve.\u201d (Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$366.28, down 2.11% (via\xa0CoinDesk) -The Securities Exchange and Commission said Monday that it had sanctioned an Oregon man for running unregistered trading venues for securities that used the virtual currencies bitcoin and litecoin. The SEC said Ethan Burnside had agreed to settle the case with a payment of $68,000 that was comprised of the profits from the unregistered trading sites and an unspecified penalty. He is also prohibited from participating in the securities industry. In a press statement, the SEC said Mr. Burnside\u2019s company, BTC Trading Corp., had operated two online platforms \u2013 BTC Virtual Stock Exchange and LTC-Global Virtual Stock Exchange \u2013 on which account holders could use bitcoins or litecoins, respectively, to buy and sell securities of mostly virtual-currency-related businesses. He set up those sites without registering them as broker-dealers or stock exchanges, the press release said. According to the release, Mr. Burnside also offered to sell unregistered shares in the two exchanges themselves, as well as in a separate Litecoin venture that he owned and operated. In an emailed statement, Mr. Burnside\u2019s lawyer cited language from the underlying settlement agreement which had said that his client provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to help the SEC deal with the emerging technology of bitcoin-based transactions. That agreement said \u201che retained financial audit experts to assist in the generation and formatting of reports in order to enable staff to quickly ascertain the scope and operation of his enterprises. Burnside\u2019s efforts facilitated the staff\u2019s investigation involving an emerging technology,\u201d according to the lawyer, Steven Ungar of Portland-based Angeli Ungar. The action comes amid speculation within the bitcoin community that the SEC is taking a closer look at a growing number of \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d businesses that use cryptocurrency technology to provide a decentralized platform for the issuance and trading of digital coins and tokens. \xa0An SEC spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny whether a wider probe is underway and declined to comment on the case beyond the details included in the press release. In October, reports emerged that the SEC had sent out letters seeking information from issuers who\u2019d used a platform developed by Counterparty on the grounds that those enterprises could be selling unregistered securities. Those Counterparty-related letters have not been confirmed \u2013 though it is known that the SEC has investigated separate cases in which funds in bitcoin were solicited on cryptocurrency-related online forums for digital currency-based investment projects. At the time, both Counterparty and a popular service known as Swarm that provides tools for firms to create and sell cryptocurrency tokens over the Counterparty platform said they had not been serviced with letters from the SEC. That was also the case for other cryptocurrency platforms, such as Ethereum, Mastercoin and BitShares.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$377.14, down 1.2% (via\xa0CoinDesk) Payments network provider Ripple Labs has scored a win in its attempts to woo institutional finance firms to its international money transfer service, inking a partnership with UK-based cross-border payments firm Earthport. The partnership with Ripple will bring together the San Francisco-based firm\u2019s software with London-based Earthport\u2019s payment services system. Ripple aims to shake up the correspondent banking model with low-cost money transfers and foreign exchange transactions, pitching to institutional clients such as large banks. Earthport counts Bank of America and HSBC among its banking clients and helps firms clear and settle payments in 65 countries. \u201cEarthport marks the most expansive and the first network use of Ripple to date,\u201d said Ripple CEO Chris Larsen in emailed comments. \u201cThat kind of scale accelerates the realization of a value web or Internet for money \u2013 a complement to today\u2019s information web that enables people to move money just like they move information today.\u201d Mr. Larsen described the partnership as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the broader cryptocurrency industry as \u201cEarthport is the first traditional, global network player to embrace distributed ledger technology.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to the core transactional ledgers on which cryptocurrency payment systems like Ripple and bitcoin are based. These ledgers, which are managed by a decentralized network of independent computers, permit fully authenticated peer-to-peer transfers of value in a direct, low cost and near-instantaneous manner without intermediaries. Ripple describes itself as \u201ccurrency agnostic,\u201d which means users can send claims and assets of value denominated in a variety of currencies. Ripple has been reaching out to regional banks, remittance services and other financial service providers, arguing that the Ripple platform allows them to make cross-border transfers directly with each other. These firms would then be able to bypass the larger, correspondent banks that aggregate much of the world\u2019s money flows. That would save the smaller banks money on fees and free up capital that was used as collateral at the larger institutions. The arrangement means that Earthport \u2018s customers will have a pre-established system for handling their technological, regulatory compliance and security needs but can also exploit Ripple\u2019s speedier, lower cost means of payment transfer. \xa0(Michael Casey and Sarah Krouse) \u2013Domain name and Internet security provider Verisign has analyzed bitcoin-related domain name registrations to conclude that the digital currency is becoming more mainstream as a player in Internet real estate. In a blog post on the topic, the Verisign team found that whereas bitcoin domain registrations saw rather erratic growth in prior years, when they spiked around moments at which bitcoin\u2019s price in dollar\u2019s also spiked, this past year has seen more steady growth in registrations even though bitcoin\u2019s price has slumped. So, while there were 4,572 registration in 2011, a year in which bitcoin\u2019s price first surged, there were only 1,734 registrations in the quieter 2012. Then, in the boom year of 2013, there were 23,226 registration. And whereas the pattern should have seen them drop back off in 2014, Verisign tallied 15,232 registrations in the eight months to August, keeping them on track to modestly exceed those of last year. The past year has also seen a number of high-value domain purchases, Verisign noted, asking, \u201cCould this be an indication that Bitcoin is here to stay?\u201d This Verisign chart demonstrates the changing relationship between bitcoin domains and price.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $377.14, down 1.2% (via CoinDesk) - Lyn Ulbricht didn\u2019t know much about bitcoin until her son was arrested last year and accused of running an online bazaar called Silk Road where buyers used the virtual currency to buy drugs and other illegal goods and services. Now she\u2019s on a crusade \u2013 not only to clear her son, but to draw attention to what she considers to be over-reaching government practices. \u201cA government that defies and ignores the constitution in order to bag their trophy is a threat to everyone,\u201d she said on Monday during a panel discussion that promoted an upcoming documentary about civil rights in the digital world. Ross Ulbricht, 30 years old, is facing trial in a New York federal court next month on the charges associated with last year\u2019s shutdown of Silk Road. Mr. Ulbricht, who is accused of operating Silk Road under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts, has pleaded not guilty to an assortment of drug, hacking and conspiracy charges, \u201cI\u2019m not here to defend Silk Road and I\u2019m not here to defend drug use,\u201d said Ms. Ulbricht. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment on the case. On Thursday, the U.S. Marshals Office will conduct its second auction of bitcoin that were seized in the Silk Road case. The 50,000 bitcoin being sold are worth nearly $19 million, based on the CoinDesk price index. At the time of her son\u2019s arrest, Ms. Ulbricht was living in Austin, Texas, and Costa Rica, where she and her husband rent out four beach houses that they built. Since then, the couple has moved to the New York area to be closer to their son, she said. She says she visits her son frequently in Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center. \u201cHe is positive and doesn\u2019t complain,\u201d she said, adding that he is working with his legal team on the defense. For Ms. Ulbricht, who declined to provide her age, the past year has included a \u201csteep learning curve\u201d about bitcoin and the technology that powers the virtual currency. Created in 2009, bitcoin isn\u2019t backed by any government and is traded or swapped electronically between buyers and sellers of good and services. \u201cI\u2019m not very technically inclined,\u201d says Ms. Ulbricht, adding that she was \u201ckind of on Facebook\u201d before the arrest. Along the way, she has become a digital-rights activist who says that the government\u2019s practices in pursuing people like her son aren\u2019t keeping pace with 21st century technology. Among other things, she has criticized a lack of information from law enforcement on how the Silk Road server was found. \u201cThis is an opportunity to call attention to what I consider alarming developments in our country while at the same time defending Ross and raising funds for his defense,\u201d she said in an interview after the panel discussion. She now maintains a website that provides information about the case and seeks to raise money for her son\u2019s defense.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$380.03, up 0.37% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013\xa0After reading Union Square Ventures partner\xa0Fred Wilson\u2019s post about his investment in blockchain-based digital identity provider Onename\xa0last month,\xa0we decided to give it a whirl. The result was +Mikejcasey, a new online identifier. At this stage, +Mikejcasey and the handles of 24,000 other Onename users are vessels with few places to go. But if founders Ryan Shea and Muneeb Ali fulfill their goal, their model for a universal personal ID verified by cyrptocurrency blockchain technology could disrupt the hotly fought business of Internet identities and personal information. If Onename and applications like it were to become ubiquitous, they could conceivably save us from drowning in a sea of passwords and, in theory, allow us to restore some control over our personal information. So what is a Onename ID? By Mr. Shea\u2019s definition, it is \u201ca digital identity that you can take with you and say, \u2018hey, this is really me.\u201d In part, the concept mimics existing services that outsource identification to a third party \u2014 those ubiquitous \u201clogin via Facebook\u201d or \u201clogin via Twitter\u201d apps, for example \u2013 but with a very big difference. Whereas those require users to lodge personal information on the centrally controlled servers of big social media companies, Onename stores it in an encrypted state on a blockchain, the kind of decentralized digital ledger around which cryptocurrency networks are organized. \xa0(Onename currently uses the blockchain for Namecoin, a bitcoin-derivative cyrptocurrency whose ledger is designed specifically to allow a decentralized registry of names and website URLs.\xa0 But Mr. Shea says Onename\u2019s software protocol is \u201cblockchain agnostic, so any blockchain could be used.\u201d) Armed with a cryptographic password known as private key, Onename users have sole control over the encrypted information behind their ID via their private key, or password, and so can prevent third parties from obtaining it and selling. The idea is that it would put users in a position to negotiate with anyone wanting access to that information. Could the Facebook model be turned on its head? Might advertisers one day pay the users of a social network rather than the company managing that network? Mr. Shea also points out that the service could include a facility to transfer ownership of a username, much as a website domain name can be sold and transferred. If one of the many Michael J. Casey\u2019s out there decided they absolutely had to have +mikejcasey, they\u2019ll have to come up with an offer. Like everything in cryptocurrrency, Onename\u2019s success will depend on it gaining much wider traction. For now, it is still very much at the concept phase, even as a core group of mostly bitcoin-initiated users have started using functions such as one that allows them to send bitcoins directly to each other\u2019s usernames without have to key in lengthy alphanumeric bitcoin addresses. One day, suggests Mr. Ali, you could use your Onename ID to assign rights and powers to do all sorts of things \u2014 \u201cto open your garage door, release your medical records or lodge an online vote.\u201d (Michael Casey) \u2013On the sidelines of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CEO Council event in Washington, WSJ Live anchor Sara Murray sat down with mercurial entrepreneur and CEO of the Digital Currency Group, Barry Silbert, to discuss why people should care about bitcoin. Two takeaways: It took Mr. Silbert six months of digging into bitcoin before he realized that it was \u201cactually something that might change the world\u201d and while his firm is hiring and seeing interest from people with banking, regulatory and technology experience, the most important attribute for an applicant is to be \u201centrepreneurial and a risk-taker.\u201d Watch the video here: \xa0 Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$378.13, up 0.28% (via\xa0CoinDesk) - Before the Thanksgiving hiatus, BitBeat looked at Paycoin, the new cryptocurrency promoted by bitcoin mining company GAW Miners. The result: A fierce battle\xa0played out in our comments stream. Clearly, people hold passionate, deeply divided views over GAW. Depending on which \xa0comment you read, GAW\u2019s CEO, Josh Garza, is either launching a cryptocurrency revolution or is the architect of an elaborate con job. For now, GAW\u2019s main business revolves around \u201chashlet\u201d mining contracts. \xa0Like other \u201ccloud mining\u201d contracts, hashlets\xa0offer people rights to a portion of the stream of bitcoins that the company\u2019s mining computers earn for contributing to the bitcoin network\u2019s upkeep of its transactions ledger. Unlike other such contracts, hashlets\u2019 terms can vary over time, have price points as low as $9.95, and can be traded on the company\u2019s eBay-like electronic market. Fans say this flexible arrangement has allowed them to stay profitable in a difficult environment in which retail miners are struggling to compete with the large-scale, industrial-grade bitcoin mining operations. \xa0Mr. Garza\u2019s critics, by contrast, say they\u2019ve lost money and were misled about the prospects of a return on investment. They accuse GAW of everything from overstating the size of its mining infrastructure and inflating its revenue to censoring its in-house \u201cHashtalk\u201d discussion forum and even running an outright Ponzi scheme. Mr. Garza denies all charges of wrongdoing and stands by the heady claims he makes about the size of his operation: 200,000 customers; $120 million in revenue over six months; a mining operation that accounts for 50% of all new bitcoin computing power coming online. In investigating these claims, BitBeat viewed a bitcoin address at Blockchain.info that was cryptographically proven to belong to GAW and in which almost 28,000 bitcoins \u2014 currently worth more than $10 million \u2013 have flowed from mining operations over the past two months. We were told this was just one of a number GAW mining addresses. We also obtained a copy of the lease contract to a 150,000-square foot warehouse in Park Purvis, Miss., where GAW\u2019s mining operation occurs, and saw photos of a new operation under constructions with hundreds of rigs stacked on shelves, high-tension wires and heavy electrical infrastructure. Separately, Jihan Wu, the CEO of bitcoin mining equipment maker Bitmain, told us GAW was \u201ca very important participant\u201d in the industry and confirmed delivery of a single Bitmain order to GAW worth 5 petahashes per second. (For context, the overall mining power of the bitcoin network is currently 288 petahashes, or 288,000 trillion hashes per second.) Mr. Garza says Bitmain is just one of GAW\u2019s major suppliers. As for the charge that GAW is a Ponzi scheme, Mr. Garza pointed out that his principal partner,\xa0Cantor Fitzgerald Vice Chairman Stuart Fraser, in whose name the patent for one of Wall Street\u2019s most important bond trading programs is listed, has \u201cgot more to lose than all of us combined.\u201d He added, \u201cWhy would a guy that already has a ton of money, and would get thrown in jail if he was involved in anything sketchy, be involved in a scam?\u201d Mr. Garza said GAW follows meticulous compliance and record-keeping to ensure it can\u2019t be charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with selling unregistered securities. \u201cIf one cent of our payout (to customers) comes from anything other than mining, it is a security,\u201d he said. As such, he said, GAW is not counterparty in trades with any of its customers, although it does charge a \u201csmall percentage\u201d for facilitating customer-to-customer hashlet trades over its platform. Meanwhile, Mr. Garza said claims that the company censored the Hashtalk forum misrepresent its policy for maintaining decorum. He said community members will \u201cdownvote\u201d people whose comments aren\u2019t constructive and that the only rule the forum moderators enforce is \u201cshow some respect.\u201d This, he said, was a deliberate strategy to attract newcomers into cryptocurrencies who might otherwise be put off by the freewheeling language on existing bitcoin forums, where it\u2019s all \u201cF-you this and Ponzi-that.\u201d As for those who complain of losing \xa0money, Mr. Garza cites the inherent risks in mining, where profitability is influenced by the price of bitcoin, which fell sharply from over $600 at the start of the summer to just above $300 in October. The critical comments, he said, mostly come from people who were not as adept at GAW\u2019s \u201cskill-based\u201d trading model. Still, many say that GAW \u2014 as with all cloud mining operations \u2014 could be far more transparent. Amith Nirgunarthy, CEO of cryptocurrency information site IHB.io, says GAW should provide \u201ctheir coinbase addresses on the bitcoin blockchain.\u201d Without that, he said, \u201cnone of their mining contract payouts can be traced to virgin bitcoins,\u201d ensuring that it \u201csmells like a ponzi scheme.\u201d In rebuttal, Mr. Garza says bitcoin purists\u2019 demands for total transparency are inconsistent with how for-profit companies compete in the real world. \u201cNo normal company does that,\u201d Mr. Garza said, adding that \u201coperating that way won\u2019t make more companies want to come into this space.\u201d Whether any of this helps placate GAW\u2019s highly vocal critics remains to be seen.

Gox exchange investigate the loss of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins and manage the process of paying back its creditors, the companies said Wednesday. The partnership agreement was approved by a Tokyo bankruptcy court Monday, Ayako Miyaguchi, the head of Japan operations for Kraken, told The Wall Street Journal. Mt. Gox creditors are likely to welcome Payward\u2019s involvement. They had expressed dissatisfaction with the work of Nobuaki Kobayashi, the court-appointed trustee overseeing Mt. Gox\u2019s liquidation, saying his lack of bitcoin knowledge would likely slow the process and result in a less-favorable outcome for them. The Tokyo-based Mt. Gox was once the world\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange. It failed in February after it discovered the loss of what its chief executive said were 850,000 bitcoins\u2013worth around $500 million at the time\u2013most belonging to around 127,000 creditors. Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpel\xe8s later found 200,000 of the lost bitcoins, but said he believes no more will be discovered. Japanese police are investigating. The losses damaged the reputation of bitcoin, which had been gaining popularity worldwide. Mr. Kobayashi said he picked Payward because of Kraken\u2019s proven operating history, and because its system, according to the company, has never been breached by hackers. He was scheduled to hold a second meeting with creditors at the bankruptcy court Wednesday. To seal the deal, Kraken agreed to pay 30 million yen, with the money to be distributed to creditors at the end of liquidation process. Kraken will provide funds to support the liquidation but it won\u2019t seek to rehabilitate Mt. Gox or buy any of its assets, including the outstanding debt and large user database, Ms. Miyaguchi said. \u201cThe outcome of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy proceedings will deeply affect the bitcoin community as a whole,\u201d Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to volunteer our resources and expertise in an attempt to minimize damage to creditors, restore faith in the bitcoin community, and demonstrate trusted leadership in the industry.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mochi_wsj', 'name': 'Takashi Mochizuki', 'twitterhandle': '@mochi_wsj', 'email': 'Takashi Mochizuki'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/11/25/kraken-bitcoin-operator-to-help-liquidate-mt-gox/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 11, 25, 23, 31), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Kraken Bitcoin Operator to Help Liquidate Mt.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$378.84/ up 0.96% (via\xa0CoinDesk) Josh Garza, who has built what may be the world\u2019s fastest growing bitcoin mining operation, is setting his sights on something even bigger: \u201cthe cryptocurrency of the future.\u201d That\u2019s the claim made in a press statement Monday to mark the launch of the ICO (initial coin offering) of Paycoin, a digital currency that Mr. Garza\u2019s GAW Miners company says will address \u201call the inherent shortcomings that have prevented bitcoin from achieving mainstream adoption.\u201d The core technology underlying Paycoin, which was previously codenamed \u201cHashcoin,\u201d is modeled on bitcoin and its public ledger, known as the blockchain. However, Paycoin\u2019s blockchain is independent of bitcoin\u2019s and, \xa0unlike the better known digital currency, will involve an additional layer of \u201cmining\u201d computers beyond the base level of miners employed to routinely confirm the validity of transactions and to maintain the ledger. Those higher-level \u201ccontroller\u201d miners will perform the special task of compressing data to make Paycoin transactions more streamlined. The controllers will periodically bid for the right to perform this task, for which they will be rewarded in paycoins. In theory, their contributions to computing efficiency should allow Paycoin transactions to be confirmed and settled much faster than the 10-minute minimum that applies to bitcoin. When the coin opens to the public on Jan. 2 with what Mr. Garza says will be an anticipated market capitalization of $250 million, the company will partly back that with a store of fiat currency worth around $100 million. While those funds won\u2019t function as a 100% reserve, they will combine with added features within the Paycoin protocol, including a supply schedule that fluctuates depending on the level of miner demand, to reduce exchange-rate volatility and thus seek to resolve one of bitcoin\u2019s biggest barriers to mass adoption. In a move that could assuage cryptocurrency enthusiasts that might accuse it of \u201ccentralization,\u201d the company itself won\u2019t sell \u201cpre-mined\u201d Paycoins for its own account but will from the outset join other miners in bidding for \u201ccontroller\u201d mining contracts. Backing Mr. Garza is Stuart Fraser, Vice Chairman and Partner at Wall Street inter-dealer broker Cantor Fitzgerald LP, a long-time backer of Mr. Garza\u2019s projects, including his first big venture, the Great Auk Wireless company, which sold broadband services to remote New England villagers. Whether Mr. Garza can replicate his past success in this project remains to be seen. But Paycoin is poised to benefit from having one of the biggest mining operations behind it. It will also tap a passionate community of GAW clients, many of whom have purchased early rights to mine Paycoin and who debate and discuss the launch on a very active online\xa0forum run by the company. According to Mr. Garza, his Bloomfield, Conn.-based company\u2019s cloud mining operation is run out of a 180,000-foot Mississippi warehouse with 15MW electricity capacity. From there, it sells small \u201chashlet\u201d cloud mining contracts to customers. The hashlets are differentiated and structured in such a way that clients can trade them on an exchange, where the price fluctuates depending the market\u2019s view of \xa0mining-profitability variables such as the bitcoin exchange rate, electricity prices and the rate at which competition for bitcoins is increasing within the network. The service, which offered guarantees to overcome some of the customer relations problems of the delay- and lawsuit-prone bitcoin mining industry, now accounts for a whopping 50% of all new mining capacity coming online, he said. \xa0After starting operations in the summer, GAW is on track to finish the year with $120 million in sales, he said. \u2013UPDATE: An earlier version of this blog post incorrectly stated that Paycoin\u2019s software would function as a separate layer on top of the existing bitcoin blockchain. Paycoin will be comprised of its own, separate blockchain. \u2013The array of new trading instruments for taking investment bets on bitcoin continues to expand. Today, the North American Derivatives Exchange, or Nadex, announced that it planned to launch bitcoin binary options contracts in early December. A binary option is a derivative trading option for which there are two possible outcomes \u2013 typically, that a call or put option pays out a certain amount or that it pays nothing, depending on where an underlying asset\u2019s price trades within a certain time frame. Nadex\u2019s bitcoin option contracts, which are pending approval by the Commodities Futures Exchange Commission, will be priced on the basis of TeraExchange\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index, which it described as \u201cthe global benchmark for USD/XBT contracts.\u201d (\u201cXBT\u201d is \xa0that currency code that many platforms are now using to signify bitcoin.)\xa0TeraExchange launched a CFTC-approved bitcoin derivatives trading platform in September.\xa0 In a press release, Nadex said it had \u201cseen strong demand from retail traders looking for new ways to trade bitcoin.\u201d Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

The firm sells two kinds of machines: a version that processes only cash-to-bitcoin transactions and costs $6,500 to buy, and a version that handles two-way transactions, which costs $12,500. The firm says operators are clearing their investments in the machines in anywhere from three to nine months. The bitcoin ATM industry is dominated by a few large players, Lamassu, Robocoin, and BitAccess primarily, but as \xa0it grows, others are aiming for a piece of the pie. The number of active machines isn\u2019t exactly clear. According to the data site bitcoinpulse,\xa0there are 300 bitcoin ATMs in operation. According to CoinDesk, which has an interesting\xa0bitcoin ATM map, there are 250 machines in operation; 51 ATMs in the U.S. across 20 states, and 64 in Europe spread across 20 countries. (Paul Vigna) \u2013This week\u2019s PR debacle at smartphone-based taxi ride service Uber drew a lot of attention, with executives reportedly suggesting the use of an internal Uber tool known as \u201cGod View\u201d to dig up dirt on journalists\u2018 ride activity in what seemed like a potential form of blackmail. The incident illuminated two misconceptions about Uber that are relevant to creators of cryptocurrency-based community ride-sharing systems. \xa0Those are that, unlike those bitcoin-inspired models, Uber \xa0and competitors such as Lyft are not 1) ride-sharing services, nor 2) decentralized. Matan Field, a founder of\xa0Tel-Aviv-based\xa0blockchain-based ride-sharing service La\u2019Zooz, \xa0says Uber is a \u201creal-time smart taxi application but it is definitely not ride-sharing.\u201d Whereas Uber is run by a for-profit company and operated by drivers that are also seeking a profit, La\u2019Zooz is not a company at all, but a \u201cdecentralized organization\u201d that\u2019s owned, run and used by the same community in collaborative way. The system is set up to encourage payments \u2014 via special tokens known as zooz \u2014 at a \u201cfair fare\u201d rate based on the shared cost of the ride. This definition of ride-sharing will help La\u2019Zooz deal with legal challenges such as those posed by city taxi authorities, Mr. Field said. And because there is no single, centralized profit-seeking company running LaZooz, it\u2019s designed to make it impossible for any manager of such a centralized company to use some sort of \u201cGod\u2019s View\u201d tool to gain access to sensitive rider information. Mr. Field said that while users will input a personal profile that\u2019s used to help riders choose who they want to travel with, that information will be encrypted and only made available between two users at the time of solicitation. No one will have access to a central repository of any information on users, including of their riding activity. La\u2019Zooz is currently in beta and working through its bugs, but a map on its web site shows that it s slowly growing users around the world by encouraging people to download its app. Those early adopters are busily accumulating preliminary zooz tokens via the \u201cproof of movement\u201d function tied to their phones\u2019 geolocation service, but they can\u2019t yet use them to pay or charge for shared rides. The organization\u2019s big challenge will be to gain a \xa0critical mass of users in one single place so that the ride-sharing function can be turned on and the new community can start to use the service for which it was set up. It\u2019s not sufficient to grow its users around the world; there must be a concentration in one place. Mr. Field said the team has a strategy in place for boosting \xa0La\u2019Zooz communities in Israel in the hope that it will later develop similarly large user bases elsewhere. We will have to see if La\u2019Zooz or its future imitators can work. But one thing\u2019s for certain, it\u2019s not to be confused with Uber. (Michael Casey) \u2013It\u2019s official: the Bitcoin Foundation is changing its focus to almost exclusively work on promoting the development of bitcoin\u2019s core protocol software.  New Executive Director Patrick Murck hinted as much when we spoke to him last month but the details of it were laid it in a blog post Wednesday by Foundation communications director, Jinyoung Englund. Based on the results of a survey of members, the Foundation has decided to a series of practical first steps, Ms. Englund said, including \u201cshedding anything that does not support core development, preparing to bring on at least one additional full-time developer for testing within\xa0the next several months, and launching at least 4 developer training and certification workshops around the world starting 2015.\u201d (Michael Casey) - Mozilla, the open-source software group, was in the news this week when it struck an agreement with Yahoo, making the latter\u2019s search engine the default option for Mozilla\u2019s Firefox browser. Presumably, Yahoo outbid Google for the contract (which cost Google roughly $300 million a year). But Mozilla isn\u2019t done raising money. The foundation announced that it will start accepting bitcoin donations, via Coinbase.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $376.50, down 2.4% (via CoinDesk) - Coinbase is giving micropayments a try. The bitcoin-services provider on Tuesday unveiled its tip button, a product users install on their sites that encourages readers to \u201ctip,\u201d to give a tiny amount of money for the material sites are producing. A number of Coinbase\u2019s clients have agreed to install the button, including Adam Carolla, Fred Wilson (on his A VC blog), the podcasts AstonishgingLegends, the crowdfunding writers\u2019 site Beacon Reader, and bitcoin social network Zapchain. The product grew out of a side project one of Coinbase\u2019s engineers was working on. The goal was to come up with a one-click system, something that would make the transaction simple enough to encourage its use, and something that would be compelling for individuals and give them a way to make money off their products and websites. The amount can range from as low as a \u201cSatoshi,\u201d the smallest divisible amount of a bitcoin \u2013 0.00000001 \u2013 up to $50, but the user sets the pay. Micropayments have long been a meme in bitcoin circles. Since bitcoin transactions carry with them such low costs, it becomes possible to send extremely small amounts of money between two people. There are others out there doing it. ChangeTip is one, which allows people to send messages, and tips, through various social media. Coinbase\u2019s is different in that it\u2019s something that a blogger, say, would embed in their site. We noticed on Fred Wilson\u2019s blog, for instance, the tip button was embedded within his most recent blog post next to the tweet button. This whole online tipping idea, though, is about more than showing appreciation. If it takes off, it could represent a new business model for a host of online businesses. For media purveyors, for example, it could even be an alternative to the advertising model, the company suggested. \u201cThis is all very \u2018to-be-determined,\u2019 but we think that it\u2019s a good experiment,\u201d Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told MoneyBeat. \u201cWe just want to help the bitcoin ecosystem grow. I guess what we want to get out of it is we just want to introduce new people to bitcoin.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - Jim Harper, who is the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s global policy counsel, has announced his candidacy for the foundation\u2019s January board elections. Three seats are open. \u201cI am enthused and gratified by the hard work so many people have put in and are putting into the Bitcoin Foundation,\u201d he wrote in an online post outlining his reasons and objectives. \u201cBut I am also concerned by challenges it faces in vision and direction, organization, management, and fundraising.\u201d Mr. Harper is as close to an \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate as the world of cryptocurrencies has, and that will contrast sharply with at least one other candidate. Cody Wilson, the co-founder of the decidedly anti-establishment Dark Wallet and the first person to use 3-D printers to make a gun \u2013 has announced his candidacy to the board \u2013 with the sole intention, should he get elected, of shutting the foundation down. \xa0(Paul Vigna) - If you\u2019re in lower Manhattan tomorrow, there\u2019s a bitcoin conference at Kings College, the fall Digital Currency Roundtable. Participants include Alex Waters, who\u2019s running an incubator program in New York for bitcoin startups, Ryan Straus, a lawyer at the Seattle practice Riddell Williams, and Robert Alder, who\u2019s worked at both the early bitcoin exchange Tradehill as well as Goldman Sachs, and is currently building a bitcoin hedge fund. The discussion will center around the bitcoin\u2019s impact in finance, business, economics, and politics.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$397.21, up 2.2% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013A\xa0$21 million fundraising round for bitcoin innovation firm Blockstream revolves around its signature project, Sidechains, which aims to turn its \u201cblockchain\u201d ledger into a disruptive, decentralizing platform for peer-to-peer digital-asset exchanges. Based on a white paper released last month, sidechain software will allow independent blockchains to \u201cpeg\u201d to bitcoin\u2019s blockchain so that users can transfer digital currencies across blockchains without involving third-party institutions. Many coders believe this opens the door for cryptocurrency technology to one day drastically alter the way our economy functions. Sidechains promise to allow \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d developers \u2013 whose inventive decentralizing applications are increasingly catching the attention of Silicon Valley and Wall Street investors \u2013 to exploit the relative depth of bitcoin\u2019s network without putting at risk the billions of dollars now wrapped up in bitcoin. Thus they pose a challenge to independent \u201caltcoins,\u201d which have until now touted themselves as the best route to achieving the Promised Land of economic decentralization. This can all sound pretty cryptic to the uninitiated. So we reached out to the creators of the Sidechains project. Via a shared Google document, we posed questions to seven of the white paper\u2019s\xa0 co-authors: Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Tim\xf3n and Pieter Wuille. They represent some of the most important players in the bitcoin coding community and, with the exception of Mr. Poelstra, are all founders of Blockstream. Here are their communally edited responses, which we further modestly edited for space: What exactly is the Sidechains project all about?  Sidechains are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks that provide useful security, risk and performance enhancements for global systems of value exchange that work without the need for intermediaries, central banks or other third parties. Like the core technology undergirding Bitcoin, sidechains are new blockchains that will usher in a wide array of new digital assets. Blockstream is the company founded by the inventors of sidechain technology, but sidechains, as expressed in software, are an open source technology. What, at its core, does the Sidechains project seek to achieve? Many people are interested in the potential of blockchain technology to be extended to other asset types and business opportunities than are possible with Bitcoin. Sidechains enable those innovations to happen in an open, interoperable way that build on bitcoin\u2019s network effect as the most accepted digital asset in the market. What opportunities does it create down the road for meaningful applications that changes people\u2019s lives? There has been a lot of discussion about applying bitcoin\u2019s decentralized and distributed network to areas beyond peer-to-peer payments. Even people who are skeptical that bitcoin will one day become a dominant, global currency have noted that the blockchain holds many opportunities in other areas of the financial services industry and even beyond. Common examples of these innovations include: All of these applications will affect billions of people around the world and our technology is a massive step towards making these things possible. We hope that hundreds of companies will take our work and begin exploring some of these applications and hundreds of others. To be able to innovate on these fields, people have created independent blockchains, including their own independent \u2014 and highly volatile \u2014 currencies. Compare this to a world where you\u2019d need to exchange your dollars for Botswana pula before you could buy a car with it. Sidechains enable innovating on the technology, without needing to first beat the network effect of established currencies. What is the upshot from Sidechains for altcoins and especially for separate, non-bitcoin blockchain projects such as Ripple and Ethereum? Sidechains enable innovation without the speculation of new alt coins or currencies. We believe, as do many leading experts, that extending Bitcoin is more likely to succeed as a result of Bitcoin\u2019s network effect and its basis as a neutral currency free from the influence or interests of its inventors. Users interested in the features of those altcoins rather than currency speculation may like to see those same features implemented in a sidechain that\u2019s interoperable with the main Bitcoin network without having to worry about additional exchanges rates and volatility. Ethereum, once implemented, could become a sidechain by accepting bitcoins. Its features could also be run on a sidechain. In that context, the ether currency [used by Ethereum\u2019s network] would be unnecessary, as bitcoin would be the fee currency in the sidechain. It\u2019s certainly possible that new innovations and capabilities brought to market using Ethereum\u2019s contracting language in a bitcoin denominated sidechain could still provide value to its users. Where does it all end? What does the Sidechains project say about the big-picture future of Internet-based exchanges of digital assets and value? The future we see is an internetwork of chains, building on and growing the existing Bitcoin network effect with smart-contracts enabling many aspects of financial transactions to be conducted without counterparty risk. We call this the \u201ceconomic singularity,\u201d and believe it will bring benefits of modern commerce and stable financial markets to billions of people around the world. (Michael Casey) \xa0 \xa0\u2013For the first time, a Wall Street firm has made a direct investment in a bitcoin company. Granted, \xa0the investing firm is hardly a bitcoin neophyte \u2014 it\u2019s brokerage Wedbush Securities, whose payments analyst Gil Luria has been a trailblazer in covering bitcoin as a subject for research. But Wedbush\u2019s move to take an undisclosed stake in bitcoin marketplace Buttercoin provides further evidence that the Street is gaining interest in cryptocurrencies. Mr. Luria, who helped broker the deal for his firm, said it was impressed by Buttercoin\u2019s functionality as a trading site, its robust technology, its comprehensive approach to regulatory challenges, and \xa0its vision on how to develop the industry. The firm benefited, he said, from a sound relationship with a U.S. bank \u2014 a rarity among many domestic bitcoin exchanges, many of which use banks in Europe. Buttercoin CEO Cedric Dahl said the company \xa0is concentrating on serving bitcoin businesses such as payment processors that need to trade bitcoins for dollars as well as financial institutions. He said \xa0the firm \xa0has already seen significant demand from the latter since it formally launched \xa0little more than a week ago. Mr. Dahl describes Buttercoin as a \u201cmarketplace\u201d and a \u201ctechnology provider\u201d rather than an \u201cexchange.\u201d And on that basis it has deferred licensing requirements to its as-yet-undisclosed banking partner instead of going through the laborious process of getting state-by-state money transmitter licenses as many bitcoin businesses have. Still, as part of an initiative launched almost a year ago Buttercoin is in close contact with various levels of government to ensure that it is compliant with a \u201cregulatory landscape that is constantly changing,\u201d he said. As with all bitcoin service companies, the effort to find a bank willing to work with them was a challenge. \u201cI cannot stress enough how difficult it is to have \xa0banking relationship,\u201d Mr. Dahl said. Wedbush, which decided to invest in Buttercoin after searching for a service through which it could conduct its own bitcoin trading, must wait on regulatory changes before it can trade bitcoin on its clients\u2019 behalf through the marketplace. For now, Mr. Luria said, Wedbush will use Buttercoin\u2019s service to \u201ctrade an immaterial amount for our own account.\u201d However, if the regulatory framework permits, the plan is to eventually\xa0\u201chelp our clients trade bitcoin just like we help them trade stocks,\u201d Mr. Luria said.

Their bet: that the project\u2019s A-list of cryptography experts and bitcoin coders will unleash a new wave of Internet disruption that decentralizes the entire economy. The company, known as Blockstream, aims to enhance bitcoin\u2019s \u201cblockchain\u201d \u2014 the distributed, public ledger that is the defining technological feature \u2014 and turn it into a universal platform for multiple new applications that go far beyond the digital-currency payments for which bitcoin is best known.\xa0 The co-founders hope to turbo-charge the development of so-called Bitcoin 2.0 applications, which will allow people to engage in \u201ctrustless\u201d transactions without having to pay fees to middlemen such as trustees, registrars and escrow managers. The decentralized blockchain is \u201cextremely difficult to corrupt\u201d and so has the potential to be \u201can efficient platform for trading pretty much anything of value,\u201d said Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn who was one of three lead investors in the funding round. Blockstream, he said, is \u201cdeveloping the bitcoin ecosystem\u201d to facilitate these prospects. The other two leads were Sun Microsystems founder Vinod Khosla\u2019s Khosla Ventures and Canadian firm Real Ventures. Other contributors among the list of nearly 40 in total included Google Chairman Eric Schmidt\u2019s Innovation Endeavors and Yahoo founder Jerry Yang\u2019s AME Ventures. Blockstream has no clear roadmap on how it will turn an open-source software engineering project into a corporate money-maker. Instead, investors took a leap of faith, mostly based on the reputations of the company\u2019s co-founders, who Tally Capital partner and co-contributor Matthew Roszak described as the \u201chighest caliber of human capital in the blockchain planet.\u201d [Click here to read a\xa0Q&A with the cryptography brains behind Blockstream and its signature project, Sidechains.] Blockstream came from the initiative of Adam Back, a Malta-based British cryptographer whose \u201chashcash\u201d and \u201cproof of work\u201d inventions were critical to the currency mining and transaction confirmation system developed by the mysterious inventor of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.\xa0 \u201cAdam is second only to Satoshi in bitcoin,\u201d said Mr. Hoffman. Late last year, Mr. Back flew to Montreal to recruit Austin Hill, a 1990s pioneer of encryption-based privacy-enhancing services, to his cause. The pair had first met as members of the early-Internet Cypherpunk movement, a loose-knit community of cryptography enthusiasts and pro-privacy activists that included Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Messrs. Hill and Back then appealed to Belgian Pieter Wuille and American Gregory Maxwell, two members of the five-person team of software developers assigned to maintain and update bitcoin\u2019s core software code, as well as to Matt Corallo, one of the biggest contributors to core bitcoin development projects, and others. The money will go toward implementing these developers\u2019 primary project: Sidechains, which aim to bypass bitcoin\u2019s rigid organizational structure by creating parallel blockchains in which innovators can safely develop new Bitcoin 2.0 applications without jeopardizing bitcoin\u2019s core computer code and putting billions of dollars\u2019 worth of digital currency at risk. Bitcoin 2.0 ideas include: \u201csmart contracts\u201d whose obligations aren\u2019t managed by lawyers but are executed by a software program; stock trading that requires no brokers; and decentralized registries for transferring homes, cars and other assets without agents, notaries or registrars. But there are many other possibilities, developers say. \u201cWe are just millimeters into a marathon in terms of developing the software that can use the blockchain,\u201d Mr. Hill said. For Mr. Khosla, smartphone apps offer the best analogy for the open-source blockchain platform\u2019s unimaginable prospects. \u201cWhen Apple first announced the iPhone, nobody imagined there\u2019d be a million apps and that the slogan would be \u2018there\u2019s an app for that,\u2019\u201d he said. The payoff for his investment in Blockstream will come later when it allows him to conduct privileged due diligence on many of these future money-earning applications, he said. Still, the indeterminate nature of Blockstream\u2019s business model made it a complicated investment for many venture capitalists, who typically must justify returns to their investors. The manager of one fund said he turned down the pitch because he couldn\u2019t invest in such a vague plan. Mr. Hoffman said he invested via his personal not-for-profit foundation, not his Greylock Partners firm, because he felt strongly that Blockstream\u2019s first funding round \u201chad to be invested in the development of the bitcoin ecosystem and not have, as its primary focus, economic returns.\u201d While leading commentators from the bitcoin community have mostly praised Blockstream, some commentators have worried that a private company with such intellectual clout could have undue influence in a bitcoin network that\u2019s supposed to be community-owned and decentralized. Mr. Hill said that\u2019s why it was paramount that Blockstream was set up in a transparent way, as \u201ca public utility, and not a way to hijack bitcoin.\u201d UPDATE: The post was changed to correctly identify Mr. Yang\u2019s\xa0AME Ventures.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$401.21, down 6.09% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013Virtual currency products such as bitcoin wallets could receive\xa0protections against fraud under rules proposed\xa0\xa0today by a U.S. financial regulator that are mostly aimed at\xa0prepaid debit cards. This news comes courtesy of a guest post from Alan Zibel in Washington: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday proposed a slate of protections for lost or stolen cards, access to account information and limits on borrowing. \xa0Buried deep in the CFPB\u2019s 870-page proposal are a few lines that could have an impact on virtual currency wallets such as those offered by Blockchain, Coinbase, Circle and Xapo. \xa0\xa0The CFPB said its regulations could apply to virtual wallets and other virtual currency products \xa0and sought comment on how the proposal might apply to them. The proposal \u201cmay have potential application to virtual currency and related products and services,\u201d the CFPB wrote. \xa0The CFPB said it is still analyszing virtual currencies and mobile financial products, including whether existing rules and the new prepaid debit card proposals apply. The proposal marks the second CFPB action that could impact the virtual currency world. In August, the CFPB said it would solicit complaints about virtual currency, putting the industry on notice the regulator is watching its activities. At the time, the CFPB said it would use consumers\u2019 complaints \u201c to help enforce federal consumer financial laws and, if appropriate, take consumer protection policy steps.\u201d (Alan Zibel) \u2013After Wednesday\u2019s stunning 16.42% gain in bitcoin\u2019s price, the market has understandably taken a breather Thursday \u2014 and in the context of classic bitcoin volatility, a 6.0% decline can truly just be \xa0seen as a \u201cbreather.\u201d Yet the question still remains: What drove it higher in the first place? Some are just saying that regulators are sounding less menacing and that\u2019s breeding a modicum of confidence. Others are talking about the onset of new trading tools, exchanges and instruments that are starting to draw a trickle of more sophisticated, professional investors into bitcoin. More technically, there\u2019s the idea that short-sellers in the rapidly developing bitcoin futures and derivatives markets were caught out by some big orders, which forced them to have to \u201ccover their shorts\u201d and buy back bitcoin that they\u2019d previously borrowed and sold. Then there\u2019s a theory, floated in this tweet by Josh Metnick of peer-to-peer messaging service EMP, that the gain was driven by Wednesday\u2019s news that bitcoin-based digital asset trading platform Counterparty had ported over competitor Ethereum\u2019s entire programming language. The news definitely drove Counterparty\u2019s internal currency, XCP, higher, but how that might directly help bitcoin needs a leap of interpretation. The idea is that amid the raging debate over whether the future of crytpocurrency innovation belongs on the bitcoin blockchain platform \u2014 where Counterparty is based \u2014 or on new, fully independent blockchains such as Ethereum, the market saw Counterparty\u2019s audacious grab of Ethereum\u2019s technology as a blow in favor of the former. Notably, whereas bitcoin-based Counterparty has rallied, the prices of many independent altcoins have lately lagged that of bitcoin. This perhaps reflects renewed enthusiasm for the theory that bitcoin will emerge as the winner in the race to develop second-generation cryptocurrency services, particularly after the launch of the Sidechains proposal\xa0for advancing innovation on bitcoin. We suspect that this debate still has a long way to go. Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Joseph Lubin offered some compelling reasons Wednesday why its independent platform is better able to scale up for the kind of multifaceted, data-heavy applications that people plan to run on it. In general, though, it does seem that there\u2019s more buzz around the prospects offered by new \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033 applications and that certainly won\u2019t hurt the price. (Michael Casey) \u2013Bitcoiners, now is not the time to declare victory on the \u201cBitLicense.\u201d\xa0 That\u2019s the message from the\xa0Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s Global Policy Counsel, Jim Harper, in a blog post\xa0warning those who joined the outcry against the New York Department of Financial Services\u2019s \u201cheavy-handed\u201d first draft rules for a special bitcoin service-provider license not to be too persuaded by recent\xa0conciliatory remarks from NYDFS chief Benjamin M.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $425.13, up 15.84% (via CoinDesk) \u2013Counterparty, a service that uses bitcoin\u2019s core blockchain ledger to provide decentralized trading platforms for digital assets, is now allowing its users to tap the software capabilities of one its major \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033 competitors. The competitor: Ethereum, whose core software code is written in a highly flexible programming language that allows outsiders to write their own programs and applications to run on top of the service\u2019s independent blockchain. \xa0Counterparty\u2019s move to incorporate that programming code\xa0illustrates both the advantages and pitfalls of open-source software models.\xa0 Many cryptocurrency businesses have adopted open-source arrangements, with the hope that openly publicizing the firm\u2019s software code can harness the creativity of outsiders who want to tinker with it. But it also allows competitors to easily and legally copy that code. The move by Counterparty, announced earlier Wednesday, also heightens a growing debate over which platform provides the best home for Bitcoin 2.0 innovations. Bitcoin 2.0 is the umbrella term for a suite of as-yet-unproven ideas that seek to cut middlemen out of a wide range of economic activities and to push the capabilities of cryptocurrencies beyond the digital payments for which bitcoin is best known. Firms such as Counterparty have chosen to build their service on top of bitcoin\u2019s blockchain ledger, banking on a far deeper and wider network of users than is claimed by any of its so-called \u201caltcoin\u201d imitators. \xa0In contrast, Ethereum and others such as Next decided that bitcoin is limited by various flaws and rigidities that are hard to change because it requires a majority of participants to approve fixes. Instead, these firms built entirely new, independent \xa0blockchains to enhance their offerings \u2013 in effect, trading initial market depth and infrastructure for flexibility, speed of transactions, scalability and other advantages. In a statement, Counterparty lead developer and co-founder Adam Krellenstein said that including the Ethereum programming language would allow users to write their own smart contracts \u2014 programs that allow contractual obligations to be executed between two parties without having to trust middlemen such as lawyers, escrow managers or trustees. Previously, the Counterparty development team would have to get involved whenever users wanted to write programs for new applications that hadn\u2019t already been developed in-house. In the statement, Evan Wagner, another co-founder, vouched for the superiority of bitcoin over independent blockchains. \u201cThe future of cryptocurrency depends on our ability to build real products that real people can use as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of reinventing the wheel, and creating new blockchains from scratch, we, the cryptocurrency community, should be making evolutionary, tractable improvements to Bitcoin itself, whenever possible.\u201d That sentiment dovetails with the intent behind the recent \u201cSidechains\u201d proposal by a group of top bitcoin software developers, who aim to get around the rigidities of bitcoin to promote innovation while still making use of bitcoin\u2019s core infrastructure. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin responded by saying that even with the Ethereum-enhanced coding language, Counterparty and bitcoin still face big drawbacks. For one, he said, it takes 10 minutes for bitcoin\u2019s network of \u201cminers\u201d to confirm transactions, whereas they can be confirmed within 10 seconds on Ethereum. He also cited the concentration of ownership in the bitcoin mining sector, which poses a threat to its integrity. Ethereum\u2019s incentive system is designed to avoid those threats and other limitations of bitcoin\u2019s blockchain as tries to accommodate an increasing number of transactions and larger amount data. \u201cWe have the luxury of designing for scalability from scratch. \xa0We are not trying to shoehorn extremely complex functionality into a few bytes of a transaction in a protocol that was not designed to be general,\u201d Mr. Lubin said in an email. \u201cPutting Ethereum on the Bitcoin blockchain will be like writing a version of Netflix on a protocol that is designed for a different narrow purpose, like the SMTP (e-mail) protocol. \xa0You could maybe do it, but why would you want to? \xa0And certainly the user experience would be awful.\u201d(Michael Casey) \u2013How about that bitcoin chart?\xa0A move of almost 16% so far today has pushed bitcoin back above $400 \u2013 to about $425 \u2013 and put in place a 25% gain over the past seven days. As always, fundamental explanations for this move are hard to find. But it\u2019s fair to say that the flushing out some of the heavy selling that occurred last month and the fact that the price seemed to find a relatively stable base above $300 is helping to bring buyers back into the market. On top of that, there have been somewhat more bitcoin-friendly signals on the regulatory front as New York\u2019s Financial Services Supervisor, Benjamin M. Lawsky, floated the idea of a compliance-light \u201ctransitional\u201d BitLicense for bitcoin startups and as the U.K. showed more interest in developing blockchain technology. In general, too, there has been growing enthusiasm for the prospect of new Bitcoin 2.0 innovations, especially on the back of the Sidechains proposal. Bitcoin\u2019s volatile price history tells us that the party could easily end soon enough. News that the Securities and Exchange Commission is truly widening its crackdown against cryptocurrency issuers of digital tokens wouldn\u2019t help, nor would any other regulatory action or security breach. But the improvement in the price will bring tentative smiles to bitcoiners\u2019 faces and could help to entice more of those professional high-net-worth investors that many in the industry are seeking to attract. (Michael Casey) In the News: \u2013One potential reason for buyers coming in: The news earlier this week from global payments processing giant NCR that one of its point-of-sale platforms will begin to accept bitcoin by the end of this year. BitBeat has been on a short hiatus, so we\u2019re bringing this news to you two days after the company announced it. But while there are limits to how far NCR will go with this \u2014 and although meaningful usage, as always, will ultimately depend on much larger number of consumers participating than has so far been with bitcoin \u2014 it will be seen as a vote of confidence for the digital currency. And that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s worth mentioning here.

The question seems so obvious to us that it rarely gets asked. But the reality is that money is a much more ephemeral, hard-to-define thing than the tangible concept of \u201ccold hard cash\u201d that\u2019s instilled in the public imagination. With bitcoin and other digital currencies now challenging people\u2019s assumptions about money and currencies, one New York artist\u2019s project is doing the same. When Nicky Enright hawks his \u201cinternational currency,\u201d the elaborately designed \u201cGlobo,\u201d in a \u201cbuy-one-get-one-free\u201d deal that\u2019s offered for \u201ca limited time only,\u201d the people he meets are both confused and intrigued. What is it? Is it worth anything? What can they buy with it? And the big question that gnaws at them: Is it \u201creal?\u201d As Mr. Enright points out, any currency \u2013 whether it\u2019s the almighty dollar or his lesser-known artistic offering \u2013 is a symbol. And just like art, its value lies in its symbolic power. In the case of a currency, that power is significant indeed, since it symbolizes the values that we collectively agree to assign to the goods and services that are exchanged for it. And as Mr. Enright reminds us, in assigning value in this way, society is also assigning values to the different forms of human labor, both physical and intellectual, that go into the production of those goods and services. The degree to which a currency successfully and broadly captures this shared agreement of value ultimately determines how useful and widespread it becomes as a medium of exchange. And while it\u2019s true that the dollar and other national currencies have the advantage of being issued and accepted by powerful national governments, these national symbols of value are no more or less \u201creal\u201d than Mr. Enright\u2019s Globo. \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $348.31, up 3.31% (via CoinDesk) - Preet Bharara had a busy Thursday. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, along with the FBI\u2019s New York field office, made two bitcoin-related arrests: Trendon Shavers, who ran the early bitcoin start-up Bitcoin Savings and Trust, and Blake Benthall, who allegedly ran the Silk Road 2.0 website. The FBI alleges that Mr. Benthall, 26 years old, has been running Silk Road 2.0 since December 2013. The site, the FBI alleges, is an online drug bazaar in the mold of the original Silk Road. That site was shut down by the FBI in October 2013, which led to the arrest of Ross Ulbricht (Mr. Ulbricht plead not guilty in September to charges of drug trafficking and Internet distribution of narcotics as well as one of conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent documents and is awaiting trial.) A month later, Silk Road 2.0 was launched. Like the original, it existed inside the so-called dark web, was accessible only through a Tor server, and used bitcoin as its currency. By September 2014, the government alleges, the site had 150,000 users and was generating about $8 million a month in sales. FBI alleges that Mr. Benthall, using the alias \u201cDefcon,\u201d ran Silk Road 2.0 and oversaw \u201call aspects\u201d of the operation, including computer coding and managing a small staff. The government said that it actually infiltrated the site by having an agent pose as a customer, who then ingratiated himself to the support staff, who in turn gave him direct access to Mr. Benthall. Daniel Blank, a federal public defender appointed to represent Mr. Benthall when he appeared in San Francisco federal court Thursday, declined to comment. Mr. Benthall was charged with one count of conspiring to commit narcotics trafficking, which carries a minimum 10-year sentence, as well as counts of computer hacking, trafficking in fake IDs, and money laundering. Mr. Shavers, 32 years old, was arrested at his home in McKinney, Texas, on charges related to securities and wire fraud. The feds allege that Bitcoin Savings and Trust was simply a ponzi scheme in which he bilked investors out of about $4.5 million. Mr. Shavers was fined by the SEC in September for his role in Bitcoin Savings, ordered to pay $40 million in disgorgement and a $150,000 civil penalty. He could not be reached for comment at the time. The Bitcoin Savings and Trust was one of the first wide-scale bitcoin businesses, and Mr. Shavers was a frequent poster on the early bitcoin message boards, where he drummed up business \u2013 promising a 7% weekly return on investment \u2013 and also parried with disgruntled customers, according to the U.S. Attorney and FBI complaint. (Paul Vigna) \u2013The team at Swarm, which develops blockchain-based tools for clients to sell digital \u201ccryptotokens\u201d to the public, has decided it\u2019s best to face head on the legal questions swirling around this new form of finance. They\u2019ve teamed up with Harvard and MIT law professors to sponsor a workshop on \u201cCrptyoledgers and the Law\u201d at Harvard Law\u2019s Berkam Center from Jan. 17-19, in which they\u2019ll seek a way forward for lawyers and regulators in this uncharted territory. The initiative comes after a report last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission sent letters to issuers of such digital tokens in an inquiry into whether they were guilty of issuing unregistered securities. Although at least one or two small issuers \xa0appear to have been served with notice, none of the bigger players in the emerging \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033 field for decentralized financial activities appear to have received anything from the SEC. While that has brought sighs of relief at companies such as Counterparty, on whose blockchain-based platform Swarm\u2019s system operates, as well as to other new blockchain-based services such as Ethereum and Mastercoin, many worry that the SEC could yet come down on them. At issue is whether selling \xa0the tradeable digital tokens that are integral to these operations constitutes the sale of a security \xa0requiring registration by the SEC. According to a document from Swarm, the workshop hopes to answer three questions: -Under what circumstances should tokens be treated as securities in accordance with existing regulations such as the 1933 Securities Act? \u2013Under what circumstance can new laws be developed to accommodate these tokens, such as for the purposes of assinging intellectual property to them? \u2013To what extent can technical and contractual tools be developed to facilitate a form of industry self-regulation. Participants include lawyers Elizabeth Stark, Andy Beal, Aaron Wright, Pamela Morgan and \xa0Primavera de Felippi, who is a researcher at the Harvard Berkman Law Center, as well as John Clippinger from MIT Media Labs, \xa0Swarm CEO Joel Dietz and Constance Choi from the Washington-based Digital Asset Transfer Authority, an advocacy group dealing with policy surrounding digital assets. \u2013In case you missed it, our Lisa Fleisher sat down with Bitcoin Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen in a public interview at the Dublin Web Summit earlier Thursday, an event attended by the likes of rockstar venture capitalist Peter Thiel and rockstar rockstar Bono. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr. Andresen weighed in on everything from consumer adoption of bitcoin to regulation, as well as on the challenges posed by concentrated control of bitcoin mining. He even gave a decent layman\u2019s explanation of what the Sidechains project is about and why so many developers like him are excited about it.

The banks\u2019 losses were exacerbated, says Factom CEO Paul Snow, because they did a poor job of keeping track of home loan documents, which made it harder to resolve disputes over how they were handled. \u201cIf there had been a Factom chain behind each mortgage account, then determining what data was missing would have been obvious\u201d says Mr. Snow, \xa0who caught up with BitBeat in a conference call from the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas. The robo-signing debacle is a compelling example of what Factom hopes to fix by taking entries from giant databases and encrypting them in such a way that the entire body of information can be imbedded into bitcoin\u2019s core blockchain ledger. The idea \u2013 like that of many of these \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033 venture, which seek to exploit the digital currency\u2019s decentralized network for services other than currency payments \u2014 is that the blockchain\u2019s irrefutable record will validate the data entries and provide a time-stamped account of changes that are made to them. Factom seeks to keep institutions\u2019 record-keepers honest but also give them a tool for managing and ordering their sprawling databases. The idea of inserting documents into the blockchain has become popular. Some are seeking to put wedding certificates on there, others are posting university degrees. But for big databases, the bitcoin software has posed a challenge because of a requirement that the blocks of 10-minute-grouped transactions that make up the blockchain cannot contain more than 10MB of data. Factom gets around this by working off the blockchain at first, taking multiple data entries and reducing to a single verifiable hash, and then inserting that hash, of miniscule data size, into the ledger. Banks are not the only institutions that might be interested in such a service. Messers. Snow and Kirby pointed out that their product could make the job of auditing public companies easier for accounting firms and thus reduce the compliance costs for such companies. Factom could also be used to keep track of different stages of a supply chain or a series of business processes, or it could capture in \u201cprovable\u201d form the ever-changing portfolio of reserve assets for any financial company that\u2019s required to back its operations with reserves. Ultimately, the goal, they said, is to win over government regulators, who they hope will come to see blockchain-imbedded databases as a powerful way to compel transparency in finance and other business sectors. If this sounds like an instrument to enhance official snooping into private records, Mr. Snow was quick to point out that the system comes with a key privacy protection under what\u2019s known in the cryptography world as a \u201crevealable secret.\u201d When using Factom, you are effectively \u201cgiving notice that you know something,\u201d but you aren\u2019t revealing the contents of that information until such time as an auditor requires you to do so. The transparency implications are powerful, he said, because its keeps information private but also makes it harder for people to lie. \u201cVery few of us are good enough liars that we can figure out what lies to tell now about something that will happen in the future,\u201d he said.\xa0(Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

You\u2019d have to cash your paycheck for an exorbitant fee and then fork over bills to buy money orders to send funds. You couldn\u2019t shop online. You\u2019d be in constant fear of being robbed. An estimated 2.5 billion adults worldwide live in this costly, inconvenient manner. Now, after decades of failed government pledges to help the \u201cunbanked,\u201d new mobile phone-focused technologies and outside-the-box approaches to money, identity and regulation are encouraging hopes of an impending escape from this financial straitjacket. \u201cWe feel that we are on the cusp of a revolution,\u201d says Rodger Voorhies, director of the Financial Services for the Poor initiative at The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \u201cThe fact that mobile handsets are so distributed provides the opportunity to radically change the cost of payments.\u201d He cites a McKinsey & Co. study finding that transaction costs for the poor could be cut by 90%. The Gates Foundation has partnered with the World Bank and a separate consortium of governments, private sector providers and development agencies to roll out a global financial inclusion strategy. It is also providing grants to startups offering \u201cmobile money\u201d solutions. At stake is globalization\u2019s next boom. Total financial inclusion could unlock the $9.6 trillion in \u201cdead capital\u201d assets that Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto says the world\u2019s poor own but can\u2019t leverage. It could free up billions in fees that immigrants pay for annual remittances, flows that are three times that of world aid budgets. And it would open world markets to tens of millions of prospective new suppliers of goods and services. A year ago, World Bank President Jim Yong Ki set a goal of \u201cuniversal financial access\u201d by 2020. Similarly bold objectives have in the past come and gone without success \u2014 including in the U.S., where the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimates there are 9.6 million unbanked households. So skepticism is warranted. Still, the root causes of financial exclusion are known: inadequate documentation, onerous regulations, and inefficient, outdated banking infrastructure, all of which trap the poor in a vicious cycle. They are denied bank loans \u2014 not because of bad borrowing behavior but because they can\u2019t prove their reputations or affirm their assets \u2013 and so depend on usurious payday lenders and pawn shops. Those who are seamstresses, food vendors or other microbusiness owners cannot cheaply send or receive money, which cuts them off from new markets and suppliers and stymies growth. Now a new model presents itself: Kenya\u2019s groundbreaking M-Pesa service, which lets people send monetary equivalents via simple SMS messages. After launching in 2007, M-Pesa is used by two thirds of Kenya\u2019s adult population and, according to owner Safaricom, handles transactions worth 43% of its GDP. Its success has converted Nairobi into a vibrant \u201cSilicon Savannah\u201d hub of mobile banking innovation and spawned imitators around the world. With M-Pesa, the 80% of Kenyans who are unbanked can send money at rates that typically range between 1% and 3%, far less than the 10-to-40% previously charged for money transfers and much safer than entrusting cash to travelers. And new competitors are putting the service under pressure to bring its rates down even more. Users can redeem or purchase M-Pesa \u201cmoney\u201d for cash at special outlets, at which point it reconciles with the banking system via Safaricom\u2019s account. But because internal M-Pesa transfers occur within a closed-loop mobile network, they are much faster and cheaper than if each were passed through that banking system. Financial inclusion activists are also excited about digital currencies such as bitcoin, which bypass fee-collecting financial intermediaries and which, unlike banks, tolerate very small transactions at low cost. Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and reports of illicit usage and stolen funds haven\u2019t exactly endeared it to poor people. But digital currency\u2019s real promise lies in its underlying decentralized technology, a base infrastructure that allows digital value exchanges in any form. Digital currency startups such as Ripple Labs and BitReserve already allow cheap transfers of claims in dollars and other mainstream currencies. Meanwhile, MIT\u2019s Media Lab is taking on the documentation challenge with a concept called digital identity. The principle is that Big Data analyses of a person\u2019s online and cellphone activity \u2013 their travel, spending, calling histories \u2013 can be reliable proxies for identity and credit-worthiness. For now, government regulators are resisting this alternative to traditional IDs. But they can still eliminate many \u201ccrazy policies\u201d that \u201cdon\u2019t actually work for the poor,\u201d insists the Gates Foundation\u2019s Mr. Voorhies. He suggests a \u201ctiered know-your-customer\u201d regime, for example, with easier documentation requirements for small accounts that pose no money-laundering risks. The good news: regulators are listening. Officials from more than 50 developing countries that have set financial inclusion targets meet periodically to brainstorm ways to ease regulatory burdens. If nothing else, it\u2019s an all-too-rare case of policymakers cooperating for a worthy cause. \u2013 Follow Michael J.

Lawsky grabbed headlines in the bitcoin world by announcing a proposal to create a lighter-touch \u201ctransitional BitLicense\u201d for small digital-currency startups. The announcement suggested that the barrage of complaints bitcoiners had lodged over the initial BitLicense proposal had some of their desired effect. Still leading commentators in the digital-currency community are only cautiously welcoming the statement. They\u2019re reserving judgment until the regulation arrives in its eventual written form. \u201cAs always, the actual language of the regulation will be what matters,\u201d said Jim Harper,Washington-based Global Policy Counsel for the trade group the Bitcoin Foundation. Mr. Harper said he was concerned that Mr. Lawsky\u2019s whole approach and warned people not to be satisfied with the concessions but demand a framework that\u2019s truly supportive of \xa0innovation. Jerry Brito, executive director of the digital-currency policy advocacy group the Coin Center, said Mr. Lawsky\u2019s speech at least showed he was listening and that the transitional license idea could suggest the NYDFS is embracing the idea of a \u201cstartup on-ramp.\u201d But he said Mr. Lawsky\u2019s proposal seemed more complicated than a preferable, simple solution, which would be to fully exempt from licensing requirements all companies whose transaction volumes are below a certain level. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of bitcoin wallet and custodial services provider Circle, which launched its first IOS and Android wallet apps at the conference, said he welcomed the \u201crisk-based approach\u201d implied by Mr. Lawsky\u2019s easier compliance offering for low-risk startups. However, Mr. Allaire warned that there could be complications if NYDFS\u2019s proposals are inconsistent with federal rules being developed by the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, of FinCEN.\xa0\xa0(Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Adam Draper, the fourth generation of the Draper venture-capitalist family, is expected to announce later Monday morning that Boost VC has closed a fund that will invest in and provide other support to 200 companies over the next three years. Half of them will be bitcoin-related. Mr. Draper and his father, Tim Draper, are big bitcoin advocates. The elder Draper has invested in a number of bitcoin companies and earlier this year won a government auction of nearly 30,000 bitcoin that had been seized in a raid on an online black market. His son, 28 years old, started Boost more than three years ago and it has increasingly taken on a bitcoin focus. The program last week completed its fourth session, which consisted of 27 companies \u2013 15 of which had ties to bitcoin. \u201cThis is a good stamp of approval for bitcoin in general,\u201d the younger Mr. Draper said in an interview. He said that he and co-founder Brayton Williams initially sought to raise $6 million, but received additional interest to bump the fund up to $6.6 million. Boost said the fund\u2019s investors include Mr. Draper\u2019s father and grandfather, Bill Draper. Other investors include\xa0internet pioneer Marc Andreessen, software engineer Ben Davenport, former American Online CEO Barry Schuler and others.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $352.24, up 0.9% (via CoinDesk) - We continue to think that bitcoiners should be keeping one eye on the larger universe of payments systems, and the developments happening over there, because as bitcoin and cryptocurrencies move further afield from their home turf, they are going to be in competition with these outsiders. To that end, we were intrigued by the news Monday that both CVS Health and Rite Aid Corp.\xa0abruptly cut off \xa0Apple Pay, Apple new mobile wallet service, over the weekend.\xa0That came after a week where the drug stores\u2019 customers were able to use Apple Pay. Why the turnabout? Well, the companies aren\u2019t saying, but it may have something to do with MCX, a retailer consortium, led by Wal-Mart Stores, that is developing its own mobile-payments system called CurrentC. CurrentC is still in development. It won\u2019t be out until at least 2015, MarketWatch\u2019s Jennifer Booton noted Monday on the MoneyBeat show, but when it does launch, it will do two things: cut out middlemen like Apple, and\xa0give the retailers first dibs on all that supposedly rich customer data. Can\u2019t blame them for trying, either. Momentum in mobile payments seems to be growing. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced at our WSJD conference that one million people activated Apple Pay accounts in its first 72 hours of business. Then, at the same conference, Alibaba Group Holding Chairman Jack Ma suggested that his company and Cook\u2019s company could combine efforts on their mobile-payments platforms. That would create the equivalent of four 800-pound gorillas in the room. Bitcoin, in our eyes, is therefore in competition with start-ups like Square, and tech companies like Apple, Google and Alibaba, and banks, and retailers \u2014 though many bitcoin advocates rightfully make the argument that, rather than being competitors, a lot of these technologies could one day become a platform on which digital currencies could trade. \u201cIt\u2019s a new world, and it\u2019s a world that completely in flux,\u201d MarketWatch\u2019s Booton said. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts need to keep that in mind. (Paul Vigna) \u2013This announcement came a week ago, but it\u2019s eye-catching enough to warrant a mention now: an Israeli \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033 startup is using \xa0blockchain technology to combine cryptocurrencies with ride-sharing business model like that of taxi service apps Uber and Lyft. Announced on Oct. 19 at the Inside Bitcoins Tel Aviv conference, La\u2019Zooz purports to be the first \u201cdecentralized, collaborative transportation network built around digital currency.\u201d Unlike Uber and Lyft, which run a for-profit model via its own server, La\u2019Zooz \xa0says in a statement that its \u201csmart transportation system will not only be run by the community; it will be owned by the community,\u201d with drivers and passengers who transact in the system\u2019s native digital tokens, called Zooz, driving its funding and development. The process starts with people downloading the La\u2019Zooz app and sharing their GPS information, a step that immediately makes them eligible to earn currency merely by the \u201cproof of movement\u201d demonstrated by their smartphone\u2019s geo-location activity. Tokens will also be distributed for inviting friends to join the network or for contributing to web development. Those same Zooz token will then be used to pay drivers for rides. The idea appears to be that the Zooz currency will develop its own value because the utility it brings as a means efficiently arranging ride shares. \xa0(Michael Casey) In the News: - Blockchain technology, the open ledger upon which bitcoin rests, has the potential to massively simplify banking. You hear that often from bitcoin insiders, but the idea was offered up this weekend by a banking insider. Oliver Bussmann, CIO of the giant Swiss bank UBS, said that the biggest disrupting force in banking is the blockchain.\xa0\u201cI believe \u2013 and this is my personal view \u2013 that blockchain technology will not only change the way we do payments but it will change the whole trading and settlement topic,\u201d \xa0said Mr. Bussmann. So, while we continually point out that there\u2019s a lot of competition out there in the payments game (see above), there are also those who see bitcoin and the blockchain as the platform that will eventually be the winner.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $356.67/ down 0.23% (via CoinDesk) \u2013At the heart of Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne\u2019s plan for a decentralized cryptocurrency-based stock exchange is the promise of doing away with a centralized system for settlement and clearing that he has campaigned against for a decade. For now, though, U.S. securities regulations will force Overstock\u2019s so-named Medici exchange to adopt key aspects of that centralized system \u2014 most importantly, a clearing house. Still, the team from cryptocurrency startup Counterparty that\u2019s been tasked with building the exchange, in which trades of \u201ccryptosecurities\u201d will be embedded \xa0into bitcoin\u2019s universal \u201cblockchain\u201d ledger, say it will nonetheless produce a far more transparent system than that of traditional stock exchanges. Speaking in a conference call with BitBeat, they also claimed that Medici would prevent \u201cnaked short-selling,\u201d a commonly used strategy for betting against shares that was the target of a long-running,\xa0quixotic and at times wacky campaign\xa0by Mr. Byrne. For now, the exchange will fall short of what Counterparty cofounder Evan Wagner described as the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of direct peer-to-peer share exchanges. Still, he said, the project offers a unique opportunity to demonstrate the blockchain\u2019s capacity to make individual trades fully traceable, which he said could make pricing fairer and prevent fraud. \xa0Ultimately, their goal is to show regulators that it offers a path toward a fully decentralized system for stock transfers. \u201cThere are big things we can do from day one with regards to transparency,\u201d said Robby Dermody, another of Counterparty\u2019s cofounders. In the long run, Mr. Demody said, peer-to-peer share trading over Medici would incur just 20% of the costs carried by the current, centralized system run by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the entity owned by Wall Street banks and brokerages that manages clearing for most securities in U.S. capital markets. Overstock.com communications director Judd Bagley, who also participated in the interview, contrasted the traceable transactions that Medici will employ at the outset to that of the DTCC, which at the end of each day nets out multiple individual payments and security transfers to and from each brokerage into single end-of-day settlements. Without that netting, \xa0Mr. Bagley argued, investors can\u2019t engage in naked short-selling because each sale or short sale will correspond with the actual delivery of a security. Mr. Bagley has had a central role in coordinating Mr Byrne\u2019s anti-naked short-selling campaign over the years. Whereas in traditional short-selling investors first borrow or at least arrange to borrow shares before selling them, all with the goal of buying them back at a profit after they\u2019ve fallen in price, a naked short sale occurs without the investor making those arrangements in advance. \xa0In both cases, the investor posts the proceeds of the sale as collateral with their broker until the securities are delivered to the buyer at the time of settlement. Naked short-selling is legal so long as the investor fully intends to seek out and borrow the shares after selling them. Mr. Byrne and others contend that the occurrence of failed settlements in naked short-sale transactions \u2013 cases where borrowed shares aren\u2019t delivered \u2013 makes the DTCC complicit in a conspiracy among hedge funds to unfairly drive down the stock of certain companies and obtain outsized profits. The Overstock CEO laid out his argument in a 2008 Forbes Op-ed in 2008. Critics of Mr. Byrne say nearly all such failures are the result of technical difficulties and the DTCC is usually able to resolve them shortly after the settlement period. His controversial claims, in which he has at times cited particular journalists and an unnamed \u201cSith Lord\u201d hedge-fund manager as parties to the alleged conspiracy, seems to be a key motivator of Mr. Byrne\u2019s bid to build the cryptosecurity exchange.\xa0The DTCC declined to comment for this article.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$380.36, up 0.53% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013Some of the biggest names in bitcoin\u2019s coding community \xa0have unveiled a new cryptocurrency software project that\u2019s likely to cause a stir. The so-called sidechains project was officially launched Wednesday with a whitepaper that proposes the creation of new sideline versions of bitcoin\u2019s \u201cblockchain\u201d transaction ledger. People can import bitcoins into these sidechains from the core bitcoin blockchain and transfer them back without a trusted third-party\u2019s intermediation. The idea is that they create an independent environment for innovators to freely work with and enhance copies of the core software without inadvertently harming bitcoin\u2019s basic software program, its so-called protocol. The proposal, which could pose a major challenge to various \u201caltcoin\u201d competitors to bitcoin, aims to ramp up the development of \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d technologies to decentralize commercial \xa0and financial activity. The proposal also carries weight because of the names behind it. The paper\u2019s lead author is Adam Back. In 1990s, he developed \xa0a program known as \u201chashcash\u201d whose core features were incorporate into the basic design of bitcoin\u2019s core \u201cmining\u201d system for processing transactions. Among the whitepaper\u2019s eight other authors are two of the five-person core development team \xa0charged with managing bitcoin\u2019s underlying software \u2014 Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille. Gavin Andresen, leader of that core team, is listed in the acknowledgements as having offered reviewer comments. The sidechains project is backed by Blockstream, a new company focused on cryptocurrency innovation that includes Messrs. Back, Wuille and Maxwell among its 11 co-founders, along with Austin Hill, who created Zero-Knowledge Systems, which develops cryptographic privacy and anonymity solutions, and who was a very early developer of e-cash products. Sidechains \u201callows you to have innovation without speculation,\u201d said Mr. Back in an interview.\xa0He noted that hundreds of altcoin competitors to bitcoin, created as a vehicles for innovation, suffer from market challenges and can sometimes breed suspicions about the proprietary interests of their founders. \u201cIn the past when people have started alternative currencies it tends to create problems when the currency grows a little bit and then somebody copies it, which is why you get dozens and dozens of altcoins,\u201d he said. None of these altcoins\u2019 protocols are \u201cinteroperable\u201d with each other, Mr. Back said. That means if a person wants to transfer value from one blockchain to another, they have to work through a third-party provider such as a digital-currency exchange, which reintroduces the core problem that bitcoin seeks to solve: dependence on trusted counterparty. In an alternative strategy, developers looking to innovate \xa0have built new software programs that work directly on top of the existing bitcoin blockchain. Startups in this field have created mechanisms to imbed extra information into bitcoin transactions so that parties can do things like exchange digitized assets or enter into \u201csmart contracts\u201d that are executed without the intermediation of lawyers or courts. But these programs, Mr. Back said, are hindered by bitcoin\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all network,\u201d which isn\u2019t designed to handle multiple, complex tasks beyond the exchange of bitcoin currency. And while smart minds are seeking to alter bitcoin\u2019s software to scale it up and allow these new uses, it\u2019s difficult to speedily enact change \u2013 both because it can introduce dangerous software bugs and because the political structure of the bitcoin network requires the majority support of bitcoin miners if major changes are to be adopted. The sidechains project seeks to address all of that through a \u201cpegging\u201d system so that transactions transferring bitcoins out of the \u201cparent\u201d bitcoin blockchain \xa0and into a sidechain ledger are confirmed and authenticated by the same computer network of miners that runs bitcoin. The sidechain is entirely independent of the bitcoin blockchain but both ledgers remain interoperable. Mr. Back and Mr. Maxwell will hold an AMA (\u201cask me anything\u201d) session on the popular social network site Reddit Thursday.

Now he\u2019s climbing onto another new-technology wave with Bitreserve, a bitcoin-wallet service unveiled in May that will become publicly available later this month. Bitreserve has a few features differentiating it from other digital-currency wallet services. It taps the efficiency and low-transaction costs of bitcoin, but also promises to lock in users\u2019 bitcoin deposits at fixed exchange rates. The service does not allow actual exchanges of bitcoin against fiat currencies but rather promises to absorb and manage the risk of bitcoin losing value against them by maintaining and\xa0publicly displaying an asset reserve covering 100% of\xa0its clients\u2019 dollar- and other currency-denominated deposits. The goal is to\xa0overcome the extreme price volatility that has been the digital currency\u2019s primary deterrent for mainstream users and thus provide them with a service for cheap, reliable money transfers. \u201cWe want bitcoin to go from being this weirdo currency to being \u2018my currency,\u2019 \u201d says Mr. Minor. A key target market for the service is that of remittances, by which immigrants in the U.S. send money back to their home countries. Remittances from the U.S. to Mexico alone ran to an estimated $22 billion last year, according to the World Bank. By locking in rates in dollars and/or Mexican pesos and by keeping transaction fees as low as 0.45%, Bitreserve aims to take a portion of that market away from dominant providers such as Western Union, which use the more costly banking system to send money. Bitcoin is built on a decentralized network of computers that confirms peer-to-peer transactions without requiring fee-charging intermediaries such as banks and credit-card companies. That structure helps keep the underlying costs of payments and money transfers down. But the digital currency is notoriously volatile, having lost about 50% of its value versus the dollar this year, after gaining 5,500% in 2013. Much like bitcoin-based digital wallet services, Bitreserve allows people to easily and cheaply transfer funds to other users in digital form. Unlike pure bitcoin services it allows them to fix their assets in a \u201chome\u201d currency, taking on the exchange-rate risk itself. Bitreserve then manages that risk by immediately buying the underlying currencies and\xa0investing them in reserve assets. For the whole thing to work, users must trust that Bitreserve stands behind the fixed exchange rates, key to which is their perception of its reserve management. The service seeks to win them over\xa0by \xa0publishing and constantly updating in a real time the breakdown of the reserve\u2019s assets. The portfolio is expected to include \xa0short-term bonds and other highly liquid, low-risk securities, all denominated in the various underlying currencies. Bitreserve\xa0will profit by the degree to which the return on those reserves outpaces its customers\u2019 assets. \u201cHolding money is its own business model,\u201d Mr. Minor said. This policy of full reserve disclosure is helped by the transparent features of bitcoin\u2019s universal ledger, the so-called blockchain, which displays every underlying transaction publicly. With these real-time disclosures, and backed by quarterly audits, Bitreserve is betting that customers will reach a sufficiently high level of confidence in the currency values quoted on its site. \u201cWe are going to be the first fully transparent financial institution ever,\u201d Mr. Minor said. \u201cI want to form a new level of compliance based on stewardship of capital. I think it\u2019s the only way forward.\u201d Like other early Internet entrepreneurs, including Netscape founder and now venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Mr. Minor\u2019s enthusiasm for bitcoin is shaped by a belief that it offers similar opportunities to build value on top of a new software platform. Bitten by the Internet bug in the early 1990s, Mr. Minor quit a job in corporate finance at Merrill Lynch to launch the tech-news website CNET with a $50,000 investment in 1993, eventually turning into one of the first online news services to turn a profit (CBS acquired it in 2008 for $1.8 billion). He stepped down as CEO in 2000 to focus on investing. A series of successes added to Mr. Minor\u2019s personal fortune \u2014 cloud-based enterprise software company salesforce.com was one; Grand Central, which became Google Voice, was another \u2013 which he then parlayed into real estate and artwork purchases. But the financial crisis threw those investments into the red and in 2013, he was forced to declare chapter 7 bankruptcy. Still, even at that point, Mr. Minor had discovered bitcoin and was dreaming of its possibilities. \u201cI totally got the idea of being able to send value through the Internet just like information,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I did not get was that anybody would hold something so volatile.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/22/cnet-founder-readies-bitreserve-launch-in-bid-to-quell-bitcoin-volatility/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 10, 22, 13, 51), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'CNET Founder Readies Bitreserve Launch in Bid to Quell Bitcoin Volatility'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $383.58, up 1.11% (via CoinDesk) - Gavin Andresen doesn\u2019t know if Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s ever coming back, and while he is not yet ready to give up his long-held stance that bitcoin is an experiment, the day is coming soon. Those were just a few of the things to come out of his \u201cAMA\u201d (Ask Me Anything) session Tuesday on the popular website Reddit. Mr. Andresen is a key player in the bitcoin world, the lead scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation who guides the core developer team. He touched on hacking, how government will content with bitcoin, and what he\u2019s most worried about. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Satoshi will ever reappear,\u201d he said in response to one of the first questions. Mr. Andresen, who worked closely (albeit remotely) with Nakamoto in bitcoin\u2019s early days, is widely known as the last person to speak to him (or, at least, to be aware that he was speaking to him). You can read the entire exchange here. He was asked about his stance, one he\u2019s repeated a number of times, that bitcoin is still an \u201cexperiment\u201d (the protocol that guides bitcoin, for example, is still at version 0.9.3, not even at the 1.0 stage that for software signifies getting past the beta testing stage). In order for bitcoin to get past the experimental stage, he said, \u201cwe need regulatory clarity, ease of use, and no-single-point-of-failure security. I think we\u2019re very close on all of those things.\u201d Bitcoin will move into version 1.0, he added, when \u201cit feels like it is stable and won\u2019t need to change (besides minor bug fixes) for two or three years.\u201d He was asked when he might do a TED talk. \u201cI actively try not to be the celebrity spokesmodel for the Bitcoin Project. Somebody else can do the TED talk.\u201d (Paul Vigna) \u2013Members of the bitcoin community certainly made the most of the extra 45 days that the New York Department of Financial Services gave them to respond to the BitLicense proposal it first release in July. With Tuesday the deadline for that extended comment period, a flood of comments have come in over the past 48 hours, and it\u2019s clear from them that bitcoiners remain very concerned about the impact of the proposed regulation. Even after New York Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin S. Lawsky recently indicated that the next draft would contain various changes in line with the bitcoin community\u2019s wishes\u2014that bitcoin miners and developers would be exempt from its requirements, for example \u2014 the prevailing concern is that draconian rules could quash innovation in their industry. Among some of the more high-profile comment letters, the newly formed Washington-based Coin Center joined forces with the two other think-tanks, the Center for Democracy and Technology and the TechFreedom, to highlight the benefits of financial privacy that digital currencies offer and the threat to that posed by the BitLicense. Their letter discussed the benefits in terms of cost savings from a reduction in identity theft and fraud and of overcoming the problem of lost business activity when people working under the current centralized paradigm forego actions for fear of \u201cpublic discovery\u201d. It then went on to describe various aspects of the existing BitLicense draft that could hinder those benefits, including that it requires identity information for every virtual currency transaction and that it doesn\u2019t exclude individuals from reporting requirements. In general, the three think tanks said, the BitLicense as written \u201cwould severely harm user privacy and create major obstacles to innovation. Virtual Currency technology has the potential to unleash a new class of innovative products and services, and it would be profoundly unfortunate if Virtual Currency innovators, investors, and users were inhibited by onerous and harmful regulations issued by the Department.\u201d Also weighing in was bitcoin wallet and custodial services company Circle. In its latest submission, general counsel and chief compliance officer John A Beccia reiterated a point that the company\u2019s management has made before that if the proposed rule \u201cwere to be enacted in its current form, Circle would have no choice but to exclude New York residents from its service.\u201d His letter listed a host of problems \u201cwhich could negatively impact consumers and businesses that wish to utilize digital currencies.\u201d These included the breadth of businesses that could potentially be covered by the license and the onerous use of capital requirements for virtual currency businesses. Mr. Beccia even questioned whether an entirely separate license for virtual currency was necessary when there are existing federal and state compliance rules for virtual currencies. Tim Byun, the chief compliance officer for payment processor Bitpay, also filed a comment letter in which he focused on what he said was the NYDFS \u2018s failure to apply innovation in its own rulemaking. Mr. Byun said the NYDFS should look into new technologies such as the \u201cproof of solvency\u201d properties available in the bitcoin blockchain ledger, which could supplant inefficient rules on capital that arise from outdated banking legislation. \u201cIn our humble opinion, the construct of the rules feels more like a compilation of every banking rules and regulations that exist rather than a risk-based ensemble of controls that enables innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d he wrote. (Michael Casey) - It\u2019s election season at the Bitcoin Foundation.\xa0Board elections will be held in January, and the foundation sent out an alert on Monday updating members on the process and to begin soliciting nominations. The last round of elections had a nasty tone to it. Several original members were under a black cloud, Mark Karpales and Charlie Shrem, as well as one of the people up for election, Brock Pierce. The hope is for a less rancorous go-round this time. The group amended its bylaws to stagger terms, and cut them from three years to two years. Two seats will be open in the January elections: Peter Vessenes, a founding member, and Gavin Andresen.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $379.88, down 1.7% (via CoinDesk) -\xa0After months of relative quiet on the VC front, investments in bitcoin companies is heating up again. The latest news is that Bitnet, which provides bitcoin services for merchants, secured $14.5 million in Series A funding from a group led by Highland Capital Partners and including the Japanese ecommerce site Rakuten. It\u2019s not as big as the $30 million\xa0raised by Blockchain, which holds the current record. But it\xa0comes on the heels of two bigger deals earlier this month: Blockchain\u2019s deal, and $20 million that went to BitFury. VC\u2019s have invested $317 million in bitcoin companies since bitcoin\u2019s creation in 2008, according to CoinDesk\u2019s latest \u201cState of Bitcoin\u201d report. That figure includes recent deals like Blockchain\u2019s, and is a 41% increase from the second quarter\u2019s $225 million total. Just over a year ago, September 2013, that figure stood at $30.4 million. Bitnet is less than a year old, \xa0founded in January by John McDonnell and Stephen Mc Namara. Both men have a background in payments technology, and both worked at CyberSource, the payments-systems company that Visa bought in 2010 for $2 billion. Mr. McDonnell was head of business development, and Mr. Mc Namara was chief software engineer. The firm has a staff of 27 and offices in San Francisco and Belfast. Rakuten, in addition to its investment, will begin using Bitnet\u2019s services. It\u2019s entering a crowded market. In terms of merchant services, their bitcoin competition includes Coinbase, BitPay, and GoCoin, among others. But in terms of digital, mobile payments, all of them are competing against trends in the fiat world as well. What\u2019s going to matter in terms of user adoption with bitcoin as it moves beyond the true-believer phase is ease of use. In that sense, Apple, which launched its Apple Pay service on Monday, is a competitor, too. (Paul Vigna) - Circle Internet Financial, the bitcoin-startup founded by Jeremy Allaire, submitted its take on the BitLicense proposal to the New York State Department of Financial Services, making largely the same points that Mr. Allaire and his co-founder, Sean Neville, made in separate letters back in August. \u201cThere are several requirements that are so burdensome (and in some cases nearly impossible to comply with) that if the proposed rule were to be enacted in its current form,\u201d the letter, signed by general counsel John Beccia, reads, \u201cCircle would have no choice but to exclude New York residents from its service.\u201d The DFS shares some of the same concerns. Circle, for instance, says the proposal is too broad in its definition of a virtual-currency firm. This is something Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky has specifically singled out in public comments, so it\u2019s likely that that definition will be changed. A revised version of the proposal will be released, with another open-comment period. \u201cWe believe there is an open question as to the need for a separate BitLicense,\u201d Circle writes. \u201cCurrent state money transmitter laws may be adequate for digital currency firms, especially if they were amended to address risks associated with digital currency transactions. This is the approach that has been effectively taken by other states, such as Texas, and should be considered by the NYDFS.\u201d Somehow we don\u2019t think Mr. Lawsky\u2019s going to buy that one. (Paul Vigna) - A fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders that is attempting raise money while illustrating\xa0the deadly effect of Eloba began accepting bitcoin and dogecoin on Monday. Called \u201cA Day Without Touch Challenge,\u201d the idea is that volunteers try to go as long as they can without physically touching anybody else. Once they inevitably to, they flip a coin. \u201cThe toss represents Ebola\u2019s lethality. Heads you live, tails you die.\u201d While Ebola is spread via bodily fluids and only by people who have started exhibiting symptoms, simple body contact can spread the fluids, which spreads the disease. \u201cThe idea of losing the ability to touch and be touched has made the humanitarian crisis real for me in a way it never was when all I had were statistics,\u201d Dr. Karin Tamerius, the fundraiser\u2019s campaign manager, wrote. She sent us the pitch after reading our piece on Ebola and bitcoin. \u201cTo our knowledge,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is the only way for supporters of [Doctors Without Borders] to contribute cryptocurrency to the cause.\u201d They hope to raise $500,000 by year\u2019s end. The longest any volunteer has lasted in the challenge is about 63 hours, Ms. Tamerius said.

Gox, once one of the world\u2019s busiest crypto-currency market places. Kraken\u2019s chief executive said the company would provide a more secure service than the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, adding that users would have the option to deposit cash in a local bank account for yen-denominated trading. \u201cWe look forward to bringing our expertise and service to Japan, where we will fulfill the overdue need for an exchange,\u201d CEO Jesse Powell said during a recent interview. Public confidence in bitcoin took a hit in Japan when Mt. Gox went under in February having lost half a billion dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoin belonging to 120,000 creditors. Since then many locally operated bitcoin exchanges have popped up, including BitOcean Japan\xa0and\xa0BtcBox, but none has so far managed to build up the same kind of market share enjoyed by the defunct exchange. Kraken only started trading in September 2013 but has already become one of the main exchanges for euro-denominated transactions. It has so far been serving customers in Japan via deposits to its accounts overseas in dollars and euros. But international money transfers from Japanese banks are subject to high transaction fees, and some domestic banks have been rejecting transfers if they are bitcoin-related, hence the move to formally launch the service in Japan with cooperation from local banks. Touching on the legacy of Mt. Gox, Mr. Powell said his operating platform wouldn\u2019t repeat the mistakes made by the defunct exchange, though he also said assets left by Mt. Gox, such as its client database, could be attractive enough for Kraken to pursue a takeover. Mt. Gox\u2019s undoing was ultimately caused by a lack of security that allowed hackers to compromise its exchange platform. Mr. Powell said Kraken had also been a target for cyber-attacks, but his exchange had never been breached. \u201cOur experience and proven track record of competence, security, compliance and technological robustness would be great reasons to use Kraken,\u201d the 34-year-old CEO said. Mr. Powell said negotiations with local banks on working together took longer than expected as some banks refused to provide a service to a bitcoin-related business. Bitcoin proponents hope the entry of the exchange will accelerate acceptance of the digital currency in Japan, which some believe to be the home of bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Many Japanese companies\u2013unlike some of their U.S. counterparts such as Dell Inc.-say they have no plans to accept bitcoin because they don\u2019t want to enter a business \u201cgray zone.\u201d Bitcoin is also seeing growing competition from tech company platforms seeking to tap into the transaction business, such as Apple\u2019s Apple Pay as well as messaging app provider Line\u2019s Line Pay.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mochi_wsj', 'name': 'Takashi Mochizuki', 'twitterhandle': '@mochi_wsj', 'email': 'Takashi Mochizuki'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/20/kraken-to-launch-bitcoin-ops-in-japan-this-month/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 10, 20, 2, 19), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Kraken to Launch Bitcoin Ops in Japan This Month'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $379.86, down 0.06% (via CoinDesk) - News this week regarding Apple\u2019s digital wallet and Alipay underscore the challenges bitcoin and its backer will face in pushing cryptocurrencies past the small community of fervent believers and into the mainstream. Hundreds of banks are jumping on the mobile payments bandwagon \u2013 via Apple. Our colleague Robin Sidel wrote that debit-card and credit-card companies are getting on board \u201choping to keep a tight grip on customers\u201d who might scamper off if they find their cards incompatible with Apple\u2019s system. Meanwhile, Alipay, the payments company that processes many of Alibaba\u2019s transactions and a pretty big company in its own right, signed up its 190 millionth user, its 190 millionth active user. That\u2019s up from 100 million in late 2013. Both of these services have something in common: They are both tied into existing platforms that people already use and are comfortable with. Beyond these two companies, WeChat has 440 million active users, and Line has 170 million active users. Both of these companies offer mobile payments. Compare that to bitcoin and its 10 million some-odd wallets, of which we don\u2019t exactly know how many are active. Marc Andreessen, the VC who in another life created Netscape Navigator and is a big bitcoin backer, acknowledged Apple Pay\u2019s potential, but is betting that over the long run, bitcoin will have the bigger impact. Bitcoin, he said at a California conference, \u201cwill actually have a big impact over 20 years, but Apple Pay is the thing that\u2019s going to have a big impact in the next three years. And the combination of those two is going to cause enormous change.\u201d This isn\u2019t really about the pros and cons of one system over the other, or the distinction between a platform and a currency. Bitcoin offers some features the others don\u2019t. But most people don\u2019t care about the kinds of libertarian ideals that permeate bitcoin\u2019s core or banks creaming fees off the top. They just want a product that works. The reality is that there are competing products out there that already have large, active, installed user bases. Sure, Apple Pay could bring mobile payments to a new crowd, which could later reach out on its own to bitcoin, and Apple\xa0could add bitcoin to its wallet. But it\u2019s not a given that people will jump from Apple to bitcoin, or that Apple will feel compelled to add bitcoin. In other words, Coinbase and Blockchain and Circle are not competing with just each other for customers. They are competing with Apple and Alipay and WeChat, too. The market for mobile, digital payments is already crowded.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $380.08/ down 3% (via CoinDesk) -Financial inclusion has become a long overdue buzzword among aid agencies and international economic policymakers of late \u2013 and it\u2019s opening the door for bitcoin and blockchain technology to become a part of the discussion among international policymakers. Earlier this month, Gates Foundation co-chair Bill Gates implored bankers at the Sibos conference in Boston to get on the financial-inclusion bandwagon and consider digital payment and identification technologies as workarounds for the problems faced by the 2.5 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d adults in the developing world. Now, courtesy of Coindesk, we\u2019ve (belatedly) discovered that Federal Reserve Vice\xa0Chairman Stanley Fischer moderated a panel on the topic\xa0last week at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank\u2019s annual general meetings in Washington, the granddaddy of international policy talkfests. One of the panelists even uttered the words \u201cdistributed ledger-type technology,\u201d a nod to the core blockchain idea that underpins bitcoin. Those words came from Standard Chartered Chief Executive Peter Sands, who talked of how this kind of technology could be used to electronically transfer titles to houses and cars in a \u201cmassively more efficient\u201d way than the current approach. People like Peruvian economist and anti-poverty campaigner Hernando de Soto have long identified the problem of property title limitations \u2013 where undocumented people in poor countries and who operate in so-called \u201cinformal economies\u201d will own a home and other forms of property but have no document to prove that ownership. The idea is that that documentation \u2013 in other words, title \u2013 would empower them to borrow money because they can use the property as collateral and leverage their ownership in ways that are currently unavailable to them. Developers of blockchain-based \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033 technologies, which go beyond digital-currency transactions to allow for verifiable transfers of documented assets without involving intermediaries such as banks and lawyers, see great potential for them to help resolve these issues for the unbanked. They will no doubt be excited to find the head of a giant global bank making an allusion to such idea at the headquarters of world finance.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $405.87, up 4.5% (via CoinDesk) - The BitLicense is coming, but it won\u2019t be the draconian net many\xa0in the bitcoin community fear, according to Benjamin Lawsky\u2019s prepared opening remarks for a panel discussion on digital currencies and regulation at Cardozo Law School in New York City Tuesday evening. In his remarks, Mr. Lawsky, the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, outlined several changes he\u2019ll make to the proposal \u2013 a special banking license introduced by his agency in July\xa0to regulate virtual currencies. The comments appeared to be his first detailed public comments he\u2019s made on the proposal. Software developers, bitcoin miners, and individuals (unless they also offer financial services) doing business in New York state won\u2019t have to apply for a BitLicense, he said, according to the prepared remarks, but traditional banks looking to get into digital currencies will. The proposal was meant as a starting point, not an ending point, he said, but it was also influenced by the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange. \u201cThe virtual currency industry is at a bit of a crossroads regarding whether it will become an important part of the future financial system,\u201d he said. \u201cAt DFS, we\u2019re committed to proceeding thoughtfully since virtual currency could ultimately have a number of benefits for our financial system.\u201d He emphasized, however, that if companies want to provide financial services via digital currencies, they are going to have to accept some measure of regulation. \u201cWhen it comes to safeguarding customer money at a financial company \u2013 and unregulated world of caveat emptor has never been a sufficient answer,\u201d he said. The current open-comment period is slated to end this month, and Mr. Lawsky said that the DFS will release an amended version of the proposal that itself will be put out for public comment. \u201cSuffice it to say,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is and will be a significant amount of time for stakeholders to provide input.\u201d He addressed several concerns and outlined some of the changes he expects to make, including a key complaint that the proposal be \u201ctechnology neutral.\u201d Mr. Lawsky said that the license will not cover software firms, something he noted in August, or mining companies, but also said \u201cwe cannot stick our heads in the sand about the the fact that \u2013 when it comes to consumer disclosures, capital accounting, and other issues \u2013 there are real differences between fiat currency and virtual currency.\u201d It will cover any company that wants to offer financial services via digital-currencies, whether it\u2019s a start-up, tech company, miner, or traditional bank, he said. He said the department is aware of complaints about the cost of compliance, especially on how it will affect start-ups. \u201cThis is a difficult issue,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cIt requires a creative solution and we are working on that issue.\u201d But these costs, whether for a start-up or a multinational, are ultimately a cost of the business of financial services. \u201cAgain, that is the basic bargain of financial services regulation. We do not, for instance, let someone run a bank out of their garage.\u201d We wonder how consciously he chose that metaphor, knowing how many Silicon Valley start-ups, going all the way back to Hewlett and Packard, did, in fact, start in a garage. (Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin prices rose back over the $400 level on Tuesday, less than 10 days after the digital currency fell all the way to $300, which right now appears to be the bottom of a nine-month slide. Trading volume and the hashrate has come off the bloating levels sparked by the \u201cBearWhale\u201d trade, and it seems like the community has finally swallowed that trade, and gotten back to something that resembles normal. Year-to-date the currency is still down about 50%, but a rise like this will likely calm some jangled nerves, and as we\u2019ve pointed out before, at $400, or even $300, bitcoin prices are still higher than they were at any point in its (brief) history before November 2013. Another interesting gauge of bitcoin\u2019s value, beyond the currency, is Pantera Capital\u2019s \u201cBitindex,\u201d which plugs in a number of factors, like developer interest, the hashrate, user and merchant adoption, searches on Google, and transaction volume, and produces an index that captures a broader sense of bitcoin\u2019s growth. The index currently sits around 370, and has been steadily inching forward, despite the price drop.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$367.11, up 4.06% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013So far, it has been a good venture-capital fundraising week for bitcoin. Thursday brought the news that bitcoin mining company BitFury has raised $20 million in new funding. That followed Tuesday\u2019s announcements that wallet provider Blockchain had pulled in over $30 million in venture-capital seed funding, and bitcoin derivatives provider SolidX had raised\xa0$3 million. That\u2019s $53 million in three days. \xa0Not bad for businesses associated with a currency for which the headlines have this past month been about a plunging price. BitFury makes high-powered bitcoin mining rigs that use its proprietary ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips, and also runs what it describes as one of the world\u2019s largest mining operations out of Finland, Iceland and the Republic of Georgia. Rather than describing itself as a bitcoin mining company, however, BitFury identifies itself as a \u201cleading Bitcoin infrastructure provider and Bitcoin transition processing company.\u201d The company said the funding round was led by venture capitalist Bill Tai, former VeriFone CFO and Flextronics\xa0President\xa0Bob Dykes, and Google Maps co-founder Lars Rasmussen. It also received more funding from the $6 billion privately-run Georgian Co-Investment Fund, an existing BitFury investor. It said it would use the funds to increase the capacity at its data centers to 100 megawatts, \u201callowing the company to cement our reputation as the Bitcoin industry leader.\u201d That large electricity consumption underscores how big the business of bitcoin mining has become. As costs and competitive challenges rise, profit margins on the bitcoins that miners earn for processing transactions have shrunk, which means there\u2019s a race toward large-scale, highly efficient, high-volume operations. BitFury\u2019s approach is said to typify that trend. On its web site, BitFury says that some 40% of all bitcoins are mined with rigs that use its chips. (Michael Casey) \u2013Trying to explain bitcoin\u2019s volatile price moves is a fool\u2019s errand \u2013 even more so trying to predict its future. About the only thing that can be said with any certainty after the past week\u2019s gyrations is that volatility will continue \u2014 it\u2019s ingrained into a market with thin volumes and an absence of fundamental information with which to gauge the worth of its participants\u2019 all-or-nothing bets on bitcoin\u2019s future. Nonetheless, an analysis of the past week\u2019s price movements and, in particular, of the sell-order that it started it all is instructive. While there\u2019s nothing to say that another big shock could in the days and weeks ahead set off another slide in the price, the way things have transpired could suggest that there\u2019s at least a base of support around the $300 level. In an analysis of the 30,000-coin sell order that was first placed at Slovenia-based exchange BitStamp on Sunday morning, Pantera Capital showed in a report released late Wednesday that 24,580 coins were sold from that order. And whereas some had speculated that the giant order was part of an effort to manipulate the price lower by a big player such as an exchange, the bitcoin investment firm concluded that the coins originated from a relatively early adopter\u2019s bitcoin address where bitcoins originated on April 3, 2013. What\u2019s interesting is that despite the pain it inflicted on the market and the accompanying panicked sales that it triggered from other investors, the sell order \u2014 which was twice as big as BitStamp\u2019s average daily volume \u2014 was almost entirely bought by the market. That could suggest that a decent floor of demand exists at the $300 level around which most of the sales took place. Tellingly, we\u2019ve seen the price come back significantly since Monday. After Thursday\u2019s 3.66% gain, bitcoin is now up 27% from the intraday low of $286 it hit on Sunday. Pantera noted that the original single sell order exceeded the size of the 29,656 coins that the U.S. Marshals auctioned in June but whereas the latter came with a two-week warning , \u201cSunday\u2019s 30,000 BTC sell wall was brought down in a single evening.\u201d It further suggests there\u2019s a decent pool of buyers who think that $300 represents good value for bitcoin. \xa0(Michael Casey) \u2013Here\u2019s a real-world effect of the sharp drop in bitcoin\u2019s price this year: Sean\u2019s Outpost, the Pensacola, Fla., homeless shelter that was founded by Jason King in March 2013 and takes donation in bitcoin, has lost so much money because of the price drop that the group took to its Facebook page to ask for donations. \u201cIt\u2019s not often you will hear us asking outright for donations, but we could really use them right now. The recent price drop in BTC has played havoc with our finances and we are down to the bone.\u201d The group says it has served more than 120,000 meals since its inception, and serves 2,000 meals a week to the homeless, \u201cregardless of the price of bitcoin.\u201d \xa0(Paul Vigna) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $347.19, up 3.92% (via CoinDesk) \u2013Crises can foster great innovative disruption, in part because the urgent need for action supersedes other concerns and forces people to try new ways of doing things. That\u2019s the foundation for what Carol Realini describes as her \u201ccrazy idea:\u201d that bitcoin could play some role in helping authorities confront the Ebola breakout in West Africa. A veteran mobile payments entrepreneur now involved in financial inclusion projects for poor countries, Ms. Realini knows deeply the limitations of traditional bank-managed mechanisms for moving money into and around places such as Liberia and Sierra Leone, as well as the promise that mobile phones and digital-currency technology have for bypassing that system. The epidemic, she says, might make desperate governments and aid agencies willing to give them a try. If ever there ever were crisis that demands a new way of thinking on how to move resources quickly into at-risk regions it\u2019s the effort to contain this deadly disease. Its global significance was brought home Wednesday by the tragic death of the Dallas Ebola patient, Eric Duncan. And just as it\u2019s difficult to get medicines, protective gear, food and other supplies quickly into and around the Ebola hot zones, there are also constraints in moving money. As aid agencies and governments seek to transfer funds through foundations and regional not-for-profit entities out to smaller non-profits and then to tiny local outlets and finally to the threatened individuals themselves, the barriers in the traditional banking system can gummy up that process at the worst possible time. Banks confront strict anti-money laundering and know-your -customer compliance rules anywhere in the world, but they are doubly restrictive in the dirt-poor and war-ravaged parts of West Africa. What\u2019s more, with just 19% of adults in Liberia and 15% in Sierra Leone owning a bank account, according to the World Bank,disbursing funds is doubly problematic. It\u2019s also risky, given the need to transport cash amid chaos and insecurity. Enter bitcoin. With the right software and support \u2013 such as the bitcoin wallets and the network of \u201cgateway\u201d agents that startup 37Coins is working on developing \u2013 bitcoin can be sent via SMS messages on basic mobile phones. \xa0And the good news is that cellphone penetration in Liberia stands at 69% and in Liberia at 57%, according to telecommunications research firm Budde Communications, almost four times the number of bank accounts. That\u2019s a ready-made platform for sending money. There\u2019s already precedent for this. In 2007, political and sectarian violence swept across Kenya, making it near impossible for microfinance providers to move cash to their clients around the country. Luckily, they had an alternative:\xa0 M-Pesa, Kenya\u2019s unique system for sending money over mobile phones. The solution worked and the crisis provided a vital test case for M-Pesa, which went on to huge success and to become a model for promoting payments among the \u201cunbanked\u201d of developing countries. \u201cSometimes there are exceptional moments that allow you to overcome extreme obstacles,\u201d says Ms. Realini. For bitcoin, the Ebola crisis just might be one of those exception moments. There would be limitations to using bitcoin in lieu of traditional currency, of course, not least convincing recipients to trust the volatile digital currency\u2019s value and to build a mini-economy around it. \xa0But while bitcoin\u2019s volatility against the dollar might seem alarming to Americans, it\u2019s not the same source of concern for people accustomed to dealing in depreciation-prone Liberian dollars. More importantly, there are lives at stake. Surely concerns about volatility and the capacity for exchange can be set aside at times like this, with communities simply agreeing to accept this new currency as a viable medium of exchange. The same goes for regulatory concerns. This is a moment for rules-bound governments and aid agencies to prioritize speedy fund transmission over money-laundering concerns. Bitcoin could help save lives. (Michael Casey) - The Bitcoin Foundation on Wednesday released its formal response to the BitLicense proposal from the New York State Department of Financial Services, a long, 15-page document that sifts through the entirety of Benjamin Lawsky\u2019s plan to regulate bitcoin-related financial businesses in New York state. You can read the letter here. The biggest takeaway from the entire thing? Expect this process is going to drag on even longer, because the department already plans to released a revised version of the BitLicense, for which there will be another round of public comments. \u201cI think they know what they have isn\u2019t going to cut it,\u201d Jim Harper, the foundation\u2019s global policy counsel, who wrote the response, told MoneyBeat. Mr. Harper said one of the group\u2019s main objections is that the initial proposal is \u201ctechnology-specific\u201d regulation, the technology in this case being bitcoin. The foundation argues that the BitLicense will result in two sets of regulatory structures, one for bitcoin businesses, one for fiat businesses, that are essentially providing the same products, financial services. Mr. Harper compared it to the difference between electric cars and gas powered cars. There aren\u2019t two sets of rules around crash ratings or emissions, for example. Left unsaid, of course, is that his position essentially says the entire idea of a BitLicense should be scrapped. The BitLicense proposal, broadly speaking, is designed to form a set of regulations around digital-currency businesses that will protect customers and protect again fraud and other financial crimes. The initial proposal, which was released in July, has been widely criticized, with many saying it is too broad, will capture tech businesses that aren\u2019t financial businesses, and will crush innovation. At the time, the DFS opened a 45-day public comment period, which it extended in September for another 45 days, which will end later this month. Assuming it does release a revised version, and opens that to public comment, it may be until the end of the year before a finalized version emerges. Mr. Lawsky has gone to some pains to make it clear that he\u2019s interested in public feedback, and is taking it seriously. It\u2019s very likely that some of the public\u2019s suggestions will make it into the final version. Circle\u2019s Jeremy Allaire went so far as to say back in August that\xa0if the BitLicense went through as proposed, he would \u201cgeofence\u201d New York state from his business, effectively shutting out residents. \u201cEverybody will,\u201d Halsey Minor, the founder and CEO of BitReserve, said on Wednesday of geofencing. The BitLicense proposal, he contends, \u201cis a tragic mistake\u201d that will ultimately hurt New York state.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $327.35, down 0.3% (via CoinDesk) -\xa0Worth magazine this week released its list of the 100 most important people\xa0in finance, and look who\xa0made the list: Tim Draper. Mr. Draper is the founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson and a third-generation VC (his son, Adam, is the fourth generation). This is his first year on the list, and while his inclusion was part of a wider move from the magazine to recognize more Silicon Valley talent, the thing that landed him there was his \u201cmost interesting play\u201d from this summer: when he bought 30,000 bitcoins in a government auction. Beyond that, DFJ is one of the biggest bitcoin advocates among VC firms. Bitcoin, it seems, was at least a factor in his inclusion. \u201cActually,\u201d Richard Bradley, the editor in chief of Worth told us, \u201cbitcoin was the decisive factor on why we added him to the list. We think the bitcoin play is really meaningful.\u201d Mr. Bradley said Mr. Draper\u2019s interest and investment in bitcoin is symbolic of the way Silicon Valley and West Coast entrepreneurs are becoming bigger players in the financial world, and more importantly, innovators in the financial world. \u201cThey\u2019re basically thinking about financial innovation in a way that Wall Street doesn\u2019t seem to be thinking,\u201d he said. There were other people on the list connected to bitcoin, though none as unambiguously positive as Mr. Draper. Benjamin Lawsky made the list (number 28), but it\u2019s not clear yet whether the BitLicense proposal from the New York Department of Financial Services will be good or bad for bitcoin. Otherwise, there\u2019s Jamie Dimon (No. 25), Paul Krugman (No. 94), Warren Buffett (No. 24) and Jeffrey Gundlach (No. 55), all of whom at one point have dissed and dismissed bitcoin. (Paul Vigna) - Just when you thought bitcoin was starting to get boring, you get a week like this one. Things had definitely gotten quiet on the bitcoin front. Sure, the price has been falling all year, but it\u2019s mainly been a long, slow grind lower. At the same time, stories of new retailers starting to accept bitcoin had gotten so common as to really feel less and less newsworthy. Then, the price took a swan dive over the weekend, amid rumors of a mammoth seller. Suddenly, bitcoin was back to its rebellious, rowdy self. Then overnight news broke that Blockchain had secured a $30-million round of VC funding, the single-largest funding round, after a long period without any notable VC deals. Paul and Michael sat down this morning on the MoneyBeat show and went over the latest. (Paul Vigna) - The Medici are a famous Italian family from the Renaissance that more or less invented modern banking. So the fact that Patrick Byrne picked that name for his new cryptocurrency project is a sign that the Overstock CEO is taking a shot right at the heart of the financial world \u2013 and Wall Street. Mr. Byrne, the founder of online retailer Overstock and a well-known bitcoin advocate, announced an ambitious project on Monday at the Inside Bitcoins conference: a new, digitized stock exchange that\u2019s built using crytpocurrency technology. He\u2019s calling it Medici. Mr. Byrne says he created a new unit within Overstock to build the exchange, and is working with the startup group Counterparty, which will use its own platform to build it. The idea itself is not a stretch, at least theoretically, and indeed Mr. Byrne isn\u2019t the first to think of it. But it does seem like a curious endeavor for a retailer. When you consider the regulatory hurdles of just setting up a bitcoin wallet service, you wonder how hard building an entire exchange will be, to say nothing of running it and attracting firms that would want to list there. Moreover, Overstock is a publicly traded company, listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Will Overstock move from Nasdaq to Medici? Institutional investors hold 42% of the company. What would they think of that? Mr. Byrne sat down with Julia Tourianski to talk about the new project:  There\u2019s an element of the white whale in this, too. Outside of bitcoin, Mr. Byrne is perhaps best remembered for his long running fight against short-sellers, especially the so-called naked short-sellers, and the market structure that allows it. So it\u2019s not surprising that in bitcoin he sees a way to finally get back at that entire structure. If he pulls this off, he may finally find victory over\xa0the Sith Lord.\xa0\xa0(Paul Vigna) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/07/bitbeat-bitcoin-showing-its-worth/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 10, 7, 17, 32), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: Bitcoin Showing Its &lsquo;Worth&rsquo;'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $332.82, up 4.1% (via CoinDesk) - Despite bitcoin\u2019s relentless price plummet, startups in the cryptocurrency trading world continue to say that high-net-worth individuals and financial professionals are itching to trade it but can\u2019t do so because current infrastructure doesn\u2019t allow them to accumulate large exposures. Now, a digital currency-focused investment management company claims to have resolved one element of the problem \u2013 the security issue, allowing family investment offices and others managing wealthy people\u2019s money to take direct ownership of bitcoin. On Monday, Binary Financial unveiled BTC-01, a new product with wallet security firm BitGo, which uses a \u201cmulti-signature\u201d system to give people secure direct control over their digital asset portfolio. Binary Financial managing partner Harry Yeh says the need for this solution became apparent when his firm received large-scale orders from wealthy individuals such as hedge fund managers during the massive price rally of November last year but was unable to execute them. There were two reasons for that failure, he said: \u201cthere was no easy way to get access to bitcoin and there was counterparty risk, which meant if there was a volatility spike there was no easy way to get out.\u201d Investment banks and Wall Street brokerages that typically place orders on such clients\u2019 behalf were unwilling or unable to do so because they\u2019re uncomfortable installing the complicated and potentially insecure digital wallets needed to own and store bitcoin, he said. But with BitGo\u2019s system, Mr. Yeh said, such clients can bypass Wall Street and instead outsource the custodial and technical role to Binary Financial, which will set up the wallet and acquire the bitcoin on their behalf but give those investors direct ownership and control over their assets. BitGo, which launched its first \u201cmulti-sig\u201d wallet in the wake of the massive February loss of bitcoins at failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, has become something of a standard-bearer in what is emerging as the preferred way for institutions to secure their bitcoin. Arranged so that wallets can efficiently send and receive bitcoin but with the requirement that at least two of three different signatories to an account apply a \u201cprivate key,\u201d or digital password, to access those holdings, multi-sig wallets are designed to allow the fluidity and speed of use of an online, or hot wallet but the security of an offline, or cold wallet. (Michael Casey) - SnapCard, a bitcoin service focused on making bitcoin easy to use in retail, announced on Monday that it received $1.5 million in venture capital from Tim Draper, Insikt Capital, and Crypto-Currency Partners, and in conjunction with that announcement the firm released a digital currency payment processor for merchants and customers that accepts a number of altcoins. SnapCard acts as an intermediary between a customer\u2019s wallet service and a merchant, especially merchants that don\u2019t already accept bitcoin. Essentially, customers mark items they wish to purchase in a \u201cbookmarklet.\u201d When they make the purchase, snapCard handles the actual movement of the money from the customer to the retailer, and the movement of the merchandise from the retailer to the customer. The firm, based in San Francisco, was founded in 2013 by Ioannis Giannaros and Michael Dunworth. It has plans to release several other products in the near term. (Paul Vigna) - There are indications that some of this weekend\u2019s sell-off was technically motivated. The price, volatile as it\u2019s been, has been riding in what technicians would call a rising channel stretching back past last year\u2019s late run-up. Even earlier this spring, when prices fell below $500, the uptrend line was still operating as support. Falling below $350 on Saturday broke that line. On the other hand, technical analysis can be hard when you\u2019re trying to analyze something as volatile as bitcoin, as one observer illustrated over the weekend. Tone Vays is a technical analyst with a Wall Street background, including stops at Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan. Mr. Vays was leading a panel discussion in Las Vegas over the weekend at the Inside Bitcoins conference. Mr. Vays had all his charts and candlesticks with him, and was endeavoring to show that with an asset as erratic as bitcoin, getting it right even 50% of the time is a challenge. The point was made for him during his session, according to an account of the session, as the price was falling much farther than his charts predicted. \u201cI did not see this coming,\u201d he said. \u201cI expected a bit of a rebound to about $400.\u201d That helps explain some of the sell-off, and another aspect of the weekend trading colors in some more of the picture: a \u201csell wall,\u201d a massive sell order of about 30,000 bitcoins at $300 that appeared on the Bitstamp exchange on Sunday. A time-lapse video on YouTube illustrates exactly what happened. As the price drifted down, somebody placed that massive order at $300. The market then spent time \u201ceating\u201d its way through the wall. Bitcoiners have nicknamed the mystery seller the \u201cBearWhale\u201d. No matter who placed the big order, the aftermath proves one thing: there was plenty of demand at $300.

The price of bitcoin dropped sharply over the weekend, trading under $300 at one point on Sunday, amid heavy volume but without any obvious trigger. The latest slide emphasizes an ironic year for the digital currency: even as more merchants, miners and enthusiasts have flocked to it, it\u2019s price has been falling steadily. After peaking at $1,147 in December, amid a much-publicized wave of hype and hyperactive news that involved regulators in the U.S. and officials in China, the price has come down fully 75%. Before this weekend, bitcoin hadn\u2019t traded under $300 since early November. After trading as high as $374 on Friday, prices tumbled all the way down to $290 on Sunday, according to Coindesk\u2019s index, a drop of roughly 22%. Most recently, it\u2019s trading around $308.\xa0Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is down to just $4 billion, after peaking at $13.9 billion in December 2013. While the price has been falling, the service has been getting more popular. Nearly 70,000 merchants accept bitcoin globally, and there are more than 10 million \u201cwallets,\u201d the online accounts people use to store and move the digital currency. More services are being introduced at a rapid clip. Jeremy Allaire\u2019s Circle unveiled its wallet service last week, as did bitcoin ATM maker Robocoin. It\u2019s possible that all these newcomers are actually putting pressure on the price. One idea is that since most merchants are taking advantage of a service that allows them to automatically convert their bitcoin sales into dollars, those trades are driving the price down. That alone wouldn\u2019t explain the surge over the weekend. \xa0Sunday\u2019s trading volume was 71,500, according to ZeroBlock, which also marked Sunday\u2019s trading low at $275. It\u2019s possible the pressure\u2019s coming from China, which comprises the majority of the volume these days. According to the site Bitcoinwisdom, volume in yuan/BTC trading has been 3.76 million over the past 30 days. USD/BTC volume is 1.18 million. Over the past 24 hours, yuan volume is 433,000, dollar volume is 189,000.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/10/06/bitcoin-prices-dives-over-weekend-falls-briefly-under-300/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 10, 6, 1, 46), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Prices Dives Over Weekend, Falls Briefly Under $300'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $355.55, down 4.4% (via CoinDesk) - It\u2019s been a rough year for bitcoin investors and Friday\u2019s 4.4% drop in the price has rubbed more salt in the wound. But you\u2019d hardly know it looking at the bitcoin conference circuit, which next week heads to flashiest place in perhaps the flashiest city on earth. The two-day CoinAgenda conference for bitcoin investors kicks off Tuesday in Las Vegas, featuring a pitch competition by 20 cryptocurrency startups that will compete to win funding from the BitAngels group of digital currency-focused angel investors. Three winning businesses will be selected from a diverse group that includes bitcoin payroll service Bitwage, political donation service Coinvox and Mexican bitcoin exchange mEXbt. The array of innovative companies is impressive, but we have to say that what most caught out eye from a statement announcing the event was the venue. CoinAgenda, which will share Las Vegas with the Inside Bitcoins conference that runs Monday and Tuesday, is taking place in Vegas\u2019s Palms Fantasy Tower. The event\xa0\u201cincludes an opening party at the 9,000-square-foot Hugh Hefner suite and a VIP dinner at the former Mike Tyson mansion seen in\xa0The Hangover,\u201d according to the press release. Las Vegas. Hugh Hefner. Mike Tyson. The Hangover. Talk about conspicuous consumption. The Hef suite is one of the hotel\u2019s swankiest, a\xa0two-floor monster with a swimming pool overlooking the city, artwork from the likes of Leroy Neiman, an outdoor terrace, and of course, all kinds of Playboy-related flourishes. The suite costs\xa0reportedly $40,000 a night\xa0(Hef, naturally, gets it for free).\xa0Even if Playboy\u2019s glory days are behind it, having a party there is making a statement. Truth is, these back-to-back conferences aren\u2019t the first bitcoin events to be held in Sin City, although last year\u2019s confab was, relatively speaking, more sedate. And bitcoiners are hardly alone in choosing Las Vegas as the locale for their talkfests. The Skybridge Capital\u2019s SALT conference \u2014 to name just one \u2013 descends on the Bellagio Hotel every year, drawing a who\u2019s who from Wall Street and an all-star lineup of talkers that has included Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Tony Blair and Nicolas Sarkozy. Despite the fact that bitcoin\u2019s price is down more than 50% this year, that the in-crowd is going to spend next week lolling about in Hef\u2019s pool shows that they are still in the money. (Paul Vigna, Michael Casey) \u2013Embattled bitcoin mining rig maker Butterfly Labs has gotten a small reprieve, but it\u2019s still battling a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission that last week forced into court-ordered receivership last month. Here\u2019s how the Missouri-based company responded to a new court ruling allowing it to fulfill existing customer orders but not to pursue new business: \u201cAlthough Butterfly Labs is still disturbed with the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s rush to judgment and labeling of the company as bogus and scammers, Butterfly Labs is pleased by the Court\u2019s entry of a Stipulated Interim Order, which allows the company to reopen its doors for limited operations. While the Order does not allow Butterfly Labs to fully serve our customers as desired, it is a step in the right direction and will allow for limited order fulfillment.\u201d The statement optimistically described the development as \u201ca promising sign for the future of our company, our customers, and our employees,\u201d but it added, the \u201clawsuit has severely damaged our reputation and it is up to Butterfly Labs to attempt to repair that damage.\u201d The company said that \u201cin due time\u201d it would address \u201ca number of unsubstantiated claims circulating around Butterfly Labs.\u201d Butterfly Labs has been dogged by customer complaints about long delays in delivering pre-ordered mining equipment. The FTC, in its initial complaint, alleged the company started taking orders for its BitForce mining rigs in June 2012, and as of September 2013, more than 20,000 customers had not received their equipment. It started taking orders for its Monarch machines in August 2013, and as of August 2014 \u201chad delivered few, if any, Monarch computers.\u201d After the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri accepted the FTC\u2019s bid to shut down the company on Sept. 18, Jessica Rich, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said, \u201cWe often see that when a new and little-understood opportunity like bitcoin presents itself, scammers will find ways to capitalize on the public\u2019s excitement and interest.\u201d (Michael Casey) - This video crossed our desk this morning, \u201cBitcoin Users In A Nutshell,\u201d and it struck us as pretty funny.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $381.32, down 1.3% (via CoinDesk) - The bitcoin documentaries are coming. Daniel Mross, the star of \u201cThe Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,\u201d a documentary he made with his brother Nicholas in 2013, was in New York this week promoting the film\u2019s release on Friday (iTunes, Vimeo, small number of theaters). It leads a field that is going to seem pretty crowded pretty soon, as a handful of film makers have realized the potential of bitcoin not as a currency but as a story. \u201cRise and Rise\u201d has had several screenings \u2013 it made its initial premiere at this year\u2019s Tribeca Film Festival \u2013 and Mr. Mross has been making \xa0the rounds. He was in Boston earlier this week, where the film was shown at the Sibos financial conference. The reactions have varied greatly, he noted. While the crowd at Tribeca was full of bitcoin enthusiasts, the bankers at Sibos watched with a far keener eye, he said. \u201cThey were watching it more as an information piece.\u201d The film focuses on Mr. Mross, a 35-year old Pittsburgh computer programmer and father of three, who was an early bitcoin enthusiast. Through his story, the film explains the workings and, well, the rise of the digital currency. Even though the price of bitcoin has mainly fallen and fallen in 2014, Mr. Mross still thinks \u201cRise and Rise\u201d is an apt title. \u201cThe rise and rise can be interpreted in a lot of ways,\u201d he said. The technology has continued to find new converts and acceptance, he pointed out. Mr. Mross said he no longer mines, but recently took a job with a gaming company, working on making games that make use of both the virtual reality googles Oculus Rift, and the virtual currency bitcoin. \u201cRise and Rise\u201d is one of several documentaries in the works, and it will be interesting to see how the public receives this next wave of media interest. Beyond the Mross\u2019s brothers effort, there is \u201cLife on Bitcoin,\u201d which tracks Austin and Beccy Craig\u2019s quest to live on bitcoin for 100 days (we wrote about them\xa0last year), and \u201cBitcoin: The End of Money as We Know It\u201d (for the record, we are being interviewed for that last one.) (Paul Vigna) - One of the biggest spectator sports in bitcoin circles this year has been to guess which big retailer will be the next to start accepting the cryptocurrency for payments. Overstock, Dish Network, Expedia, and Dell all have climbed on board. One group of enthusiasts, however, isn\u2019t just waiting for the next big company to turn, they\u2019re trying to force the issue, and they\u2019re aiming high. A petition has surfaced on change.org asking Amazon to make itself the next big company to get on the bandwagon. \u201cBitcoin is safe, simple, cheap, and most importantly, secure,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cCompanies that accept Bitcoin show that they care about their customers.\u201d The petition has more than 4,000 signatures. We doubt Amazon will be swayed by such an exhortation, but being a major, maybe the major, ecommerce company out there, it would be a big feather for bitcoin\u2019s cap.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $387.77, up 3.5% (via CoinDesk) - Robocoin, known for its bitcoin ATM, is getting into the wallet business.\xa0The Las Vegas-based startup on Tuesday unveiled its Robocoin wallet, an extension of its ATM network and a product that is ultimately aimed at making its ATMs easier to use. Jordan Kelley, the company\u2019s CEO, said the idea for the wallet came as soon as they installed their first ATM. He recounted a story about being in Vancouver when the company launched that first machine. He was sitting in Waves Coffee House, and saw \u201cprofound interest\u201d from the patrons there, \u201cbut when the moment came to bring somebody brand new (to bitcoin), the usability of these machines was not there.\u201d The problem as he saw it was that the user experience wasn\u2019t seemless; if the customer didn\u2019t already have a bitcoin wallet, the ATM wasn\u2019t much use to them. It was during that first launch, he said, when they started conceiving of the wallet to go along with the ATM. It\u2019s another extension of the plan the company unveiled in May,\xa0to make its free-standing machines essentially the equivalent of a bank branch. The new wallet operates like other bitcoin wallets,\xa0allowing users to store, send and receive bitcoin. The twist is that it\u2019s tied into the ATM network. The new product utilizes \u201cmulti-sig\u201d features, as well as a biometric signature; if a user has their phone number and palm, they can access their wallet. Mr. Kelly said the new wallets will be compliant with standard banking regulations, like the know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules, but they are not seeking individual state banking licenses. It joins a crowded field. Besides the major wallet providers, Blockchain and Coinbase, Circle on Monday released its wallet service to the general public. Meanwhile, there are more individual wallets set up by people who\u2019ve downloaded the bitcoin client software than there are from all\xa0the wallet providers combined. The wallets are being launched at \u201cbranches\u201d in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Mountain View, Calif., on Tuesday, and rolled out to existing customers first before they\u2019re opened up to the general public. (Paul Vigna) - Everybody knows that you need very powerful computers to mine for bitcoin. But everybody, it turns out, is wrong. One Google programmer quixotically set out to solve bitcoin\u2019s algorithms using only a pencil and paper, Inside Bitcoins reports. Ken Shirriff showed that it was actually possible to solve a \u201chash\u201d by hand (the previous link includes a video he made in which he went through the actual process.) As you might assume, however, it\u2019s not nearly as fast as using a computer. It took him almost 17 minutes to do something that a computer does about a quintillion times faster. \u201cNeedless to say, manual bitcoin mining is not at all practical,\u201d he wrote on his blog. Still, if you\u2019re the type who enjoys the mathematical equivalent of changing your own spark plugs, there\u2019s a certain accomplishment to be had, and it shows exactly what\u2019s going on inside all those supercomputers.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $376.45, up 0.07% (via CoinDesk) - The Circle is now complete. Circle Internet Financial, the bitcoin startup founded by Jeremy Allaire, finally released its bitcoin wallet service, unveiling it at the Sibos2014 financial conference in Boston on Monday (you can watch a live stream of it here; Bill Gates, incidentally, is scheduled to speak on Thursday). On the one hand, Circle\u2019s offering isn\u2019t ground breaking. It\u2019s essentially a bitcoin wallet. On the other hand, it\u2019s different from other bitcoin wallets, and may be the first product that is user friendly to the non-bitcoin crowd. Previous wallet services, like the one from Blockchain, have been designed for a technically oriented crowd; they are expressly a place to store your bitcoins and using them requires some technical knowledge. Circle is expressly designed for a non-technical crowd; it is a place to store and spend money digitally, a subtle but key difference, and requires only that users understand the Internet in general. Account balances, for instance, are rendered in the users\u2019 home currency. Circle is using bitcoin for transactions, but as far as the user is concerned, that\u2019s in the background. They don\u2019t even need to be aware of bitcoin. \u201cOur mission is really to radically simplify consumer financial products, retail consumer financial products, by building entirely on digital platforms,\u201d Mr. Allaire said during his presentation. The wallet can accept 160 different currencies, and both the product and customer services are available in seven languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, German, and French \u2013 covering roughly 40% of the world\u2019s population. Importantly, Circle says customer deposits will be 100% covered for any user anywhere holding bitcoin in their account. Marsh is the insurance broker, and the company says it\u2019s been adding underwriters and expanding its insurance program for both online and offline assets. Other underwriters are all \u201chighly rated,\u201d the firm said, without mentioning names. There are more than 9 million wallets out there, between the leading providers, Blockchain (2.2 million) and Coinbase (1.6 million), as well as bitcoin client software (5.5 million), the individual wallets that allow people to operate as essentially their own bank. That last product is for the most technically minded users. What will be interesting is to see whether Circle can really attract that non-bitcoin crowd. (Paul Vigna) -The Sibos2014 event a provided a unique opportunity for mainstream bankers and payment system experts to gain exposure to bitcoin. The entire morning session for the conference\u2019s \u201cInnotribe\u201d forum dedicated to financial innovation focused on cryptocurrency-led disruption. But if bitcoiners hoped \xa0this was an opportunity to convert some influential players to their cause, they may have been disappointed by the show of hands that followed one panel discussion on regulation. Asked to flash cards that conveyed either a positive view of bitcoin\u2019s future \xa0(a plain bow tie image) or a negative view (a bow tie with a skull ), the live video footage suggested a win for the skulls. The session was informative and compelling and included a relatively accommodating statement from Anne Shere Wallwork of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes on the agency\u2019s willingness to encourage innovation. Yet the bankers and back-office managers in the room weren\u2019t buying. Why not? The answer may lie in what tech entrepreneur Peter Hinssen said when he took the microphone at the end of the session. Mr. Hinssen compared bankers\u2019 cryptocurrency views to telecom companies\u2019 early dismissals of the core TCP/IP platfrom that runs the Internet even as it was taking on a unstoppable life of its own. Just as \u201ctelcos hated TCP/IP \xa0because no one designed it\u2026 no one was in charge,\u201d so too are bankers uncomfortable with the decentralized, open-source nature of bitcoin\u2019s development, he said. \u201cThe fact that we have something revolutionary that didn\u2019t come from the banks is really scary for you,\u201d Mr. Hinssen said. (Michael Casey) \u2013So much for that $400 support theory.\xa0In the two days after we ran a BitBeat item on Friday referring to Josh Brown\u2019s theory that technical analysis is especially important for bitcoin\xa0trading and in which he observed that $400 seemed to mark a historical support level, the price dropped 6.3% to a close on Sunday at $376.20, according to Coindesk\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $403.77, down 1.2% (via CoinDesk) - We\u2019re still learning what bitcoin and the technology that powers it can do. The idea of a digital currency has been largely absorbed by now. What\u2019s fascinating is that people are starting to experiment with all that can be done with the digital, permanent, public ledger called the blockchain. Such experiments often fall under the rubric \u201cBitcoin 2.0,\u201d and a lot of it lies in business opportunities built on top of the technology. But it\u2019s not all about making money. \xa0One interesting idea crossed our desk this week: a blockchain wedding certificate. The move by this couple is based on the idea that the bitcoin blockchain \xa0can strengthen the significance of a public declaration, or at the very least provide an alternative way of affirming it \u2014 including the declaration of love and commitment in a marriage certificate. Almost any document can be digitized, codified and inserted into the blockchain, a record that is indelible, cannot be tampered with, and whose authenticity is verified by the consensus of a community of computer users rather than by the discretionary order of a judge, priest or town official. \xa0It\u2019s an idea in line with one adopted by University of Nicosia for the scholarship certificates from its online class in digital currencies. (A fuller explanation of what they did can be found here). So, rather than have their betrothal recorded by either city hall or the parson, David Mondrus and Joyce Bayo are opting to have their nuptials sanctified by the blockchain. They are getting hitched on Oct. 5 \u2013 in Walt Disney World in Florida, of all places, at a bitcoin conference/party called Coins in the Kingdom. \u201cOur relationship is not defined by governments or the church,\u201d said Mr. Mondrus, CEO of online retailer Red Box Jewels and an advisor to the startup Bitnation. The blockchain certificate is actually one of the services that Bitnation \u2013 which describes itself as a \u201cfully inclusive governance system\u201d \u2013 aims to provide. When you wish upon a star\u2026 (Paul Vigna) \u2013Self-described \u201cserial entrepreneur\u201d and author Carol Realini, a mobile payments veteran who works with startups focused on expanding financial inclusion, has some strong views on bitcoin\u2019s potential to solve the financial problems of the world\u2019s poor. Bitcoin matters, she says, because it offers the wholesale infrastructure overhaul that\u2019s needed to to achieve true financial inclusion for the world\u2019s billions of \u201cunbanked.\u201d Ms. Realini has been involved for more than a decade in efforts to expand banking services to the poor through the existing financial system and has found that its rigidity and ingrained obstacles to change make that legacy system a near impossible route to solving the problem of exclusion. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard to reform the current infrastructure to accomplish scale and financial inclusion,\u201d the former CEO and founder of developing country-focused mobile payments provider Obapay said in an interview. \xa0\u201cBitcoin will be a key enabler for changing the game for financial services and allowing a lot more people to participate in the global economy. We can achieve that on the existing infrastructure, but it\u2019s just very painful.\u201d She said bitcoin has \u201ctransactional advantages\u201d over the existing infrastructure, which lowers cost, and it has an \u201copen community advantage that is going to move like lightning.\u201d She noted that everyone gets to benefit from \u201cthe large community that is evolving the technology.\u201d By comparison, Ms. Realini said, \u201cI see how all innovation is bogged down\u201d in the centralized model of the \u201clegacy system.\u201d (Michael Casey) - The bitcoin price can\u2019t seem to pull away from the $400 level. But then again, it\u2019s having a hard time falling below it too. In technical analysis terms, then, this nice round number is looking like a classic support level. And here\u2019s one analysis, from Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO, CNBC commentator and blogger Josh Brown, arguing that bitcoin\u2019s history of dealing with this level suggests it could represent a buying opportunity. Mr. Brown points out that $400 not only marked the liftoff point when bitcoin\u2019s price went parabolic in second half of November last year, eventually getting above $1,100 in early December, but also the support level it found in April after the drawn-out decline that followed that through the winter and early spring. He argues that in bitcoin\u2019s case, where it\u2019s hard to draw upon fundamentals with which to make a case for \u201cfair value,\u201d these technical signals are about all an investor can go on. If I were inclined to trade stuff like this, I\u2019d be a buyer here and I\u2019d grow emboldened should it smack $400 again and bounce off as it seems to have done this week,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019d be looking to sell by December as the enthusiasm for BTC purchasing comes and goes.\u201d (Michael Casey) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/09/26/bitbeat-wedding-bells-on-the-blockchain/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 26, 18, 22), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: Wedding Bells on the Blockchain'}, {'articleText': u' Ripple Labs, whose bitcoin-inspired payments network allows institutions to conduct low-cost international money transfers without the intermediation of large Wall Street banks, has signed its first two U.S. banks as customers. The two banks \u2013 122-year-old CBW Bank of Topeka, Kansas and Cross River Bank of Teaneck, NJ \u2013 are \xa0not national household names. Nonetheless, their embrace of the Ripple model marks a milestone for the Silicon Valley startup. And it could open the door for America\u2019s embattled regional and community banks to recover control over a cross-border commercial banking business that was long ago ceded to bigger institutions. Patrick Griffin, Ripple Lab\u2019s executive vice-president of business development, said the system allows smaller banks to transfer money abroad by connecting to\xa0 existing Ripple clients, such as Fidor Bank of Germany. And they can provide low-cost cross-border transfer services to other small U.S. banks. The big benefit, he said, is that smaller banks would no longer need to deal with \u201ccorrespondent banks\u201d such as J.P. Morgan & Co., HSBC Holdings, Standard & Chartered and Wells Fargo, to intermediate this business. That should also do away with the accompanying fees, foreign exchange \u201cspread\u201d costs and, most importantly, the large collateral commitments that the bigger banks periodically demand to act as the middleman. \u201cThis is the first viable alternative to correspondent banking in about 40 years,\u201d said Mr. Griffin in an interview. \u201cRegional banks can now move money bilaterally to other regional banks without having to relay those funds through an intermediary.\u201d The software program that runs Ripple, known as its \u201cprotocol\u201d, allows for direct fund transfers and foreign exchange transactions between institutions. A network of computers running that program works together through a system of consensus to ensure trades are executed, confirmed, cleared and settled, in multiple currencies. It promises small institutions the capacity to trust each other in a direct transaction without having to put up large amounts of capital to back up those transactions or outsource elements to big custodial and foreign exchange banks. \xa0In theory, that should allow them to offer significantly cheaper foreign exchange and bank wire services to their customers. This kind of \u201cdecentralized\u201d network \u2013 which collectively takes on the work done by middlemen institutions in the traditional system \xa0\u2013 has similarities to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. How? Its member computers work off a common set of software-driven rules to confirm transactions. But whereas transaction confirmations can take 10 minutes or more on bitcoin, it takes seconds on Ripple. One other big difference: Whereas bitcoin\u2019s system for confirming transactions is built on a network of independent miners who compete for bitcoins and are adding ever-more computing power in a bid to win that competition, the \u201cvalidators\u201d in the Ripple network contribute computing resources without direct reward and without the intense competition. The assumption is that they will be motivated by an interest in maintaining the integrity of the Ripple network for its own sake and thus that much of that work will be provided by gateway institutions such as CBW and Cross River banks and by other firms providing products over the Ripple protocol, such as new digital assets. \xa0While anyone is free to download the software and play this role, these firms have a special interest in seeing Ripple succeed and so are expected to be especially motivated to freely act as validators of transactions. In a statement, Suresh Ramamurthi, chairman and chief technology officer of CBW Bank said Ripple offered a way around an \u201cantiquated\u201d system. \u201cToday\u2019s banks offer the equivalent of 300-year old paper ledgers converted to an electronic form \u2013 a digital skin on an antiquated transaction process,\u201d Mr. Ramamurthi said. \u201cWe\u2019ll now be one of the first banks in the world to offer customers a reliable, compliant, safe and secure way to instantly send and receive money internationally.\xa0\u201c And in a separate statement, Gilles Gade, president and chief executive officer of Cross River Bank, said \u201cOur business customers expect banking to move at the speed of the Web, but with the security and confidence of the traditional financial system\u2026Ripple will help make that a reality.\u201d \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

The money-processing business, a unit of eBay, announced on Tuesday that it will allow merchants that use its service to accept bitcoin payments through its processing hub, another incremental step into the world of cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s significant in that this is PayPal\u2019s second step, after it opened up its Braintree unit to bitcoin transactions earlier this month via Coinbase. It\u2019s not full-bore acceptance, mind you, and for now it\u2019s only good for digital goods like ebooks.\xa0PayPal is working with GoCoin, Coinbase, and BitPay, and those firms will handle the bitcoin transactions, not PayPal. It\u2019s like \u201cdipping a toe,\u201d said Steve Beauregard, CEO of\xa0GoCoin. PayPal isn\u2019t adopting bitcoin so much as opening up its rails as a conduit for bitcoin business. PayPal customers, for instance, won\u2019t be able to fill their online wallet with bitcoins, and for merchants that already take bitcoin, there\u2019s no new advantage in terms of bitcoin vs. traditional payments systems. The advantage to bitcoin companies comes in getting\xa0access to PayPal\u2019s 152 million active customers, and in being able to use PayPal to reach merchants and even customers they previously were not reaching. It\u2019s still an experiment, but it\u2019s another sign that digital currencies are getting further integrated into the mainstream. Bitcoin prices seemed to have responded to the news, though it\u2019s hard to ever say for sure what drives the volatile currency. Prices were around $400 at the time of the announcement, and shot up to $440 in the hour afterwards. (Paul Vigna) - Mining is hard work, both in the real and virtual worlds. In the wake of the forced shut-down of Butterfly Labs by the FTC, we were reminded of this chart that was sent to us by Steve Hanke, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins. Professor Hanke constructed a number of charts around bitcoin (which you can see at this\xa0post from Cato Institute), but the one that stood out to us was this one: Mr. Hanke arrived at those figures by calculating the number of bitcoins mined per day, minus transaction fees, multiplied by the market price for bitcoins. As you can see, after peaking in December, in conjunction with the peak of bitcoin prices, mining has become increasing less profitable. That\u2019s a function of a squeeze: as more miners get involved in bitcoin, the degree of difficulty is increased automatically. That makes it harder to successfully mine coins, but if that happens at the same time that the price is going down, it\u2019s a double-barreled shot at the miners. A wait time of months between ordering a mining rig and having it delivered \u2013 and Butterfly Labs was not alone in that dynamic \u2013 could and did render many machines worthless by the time they arrived; the difficulty had already outpaced their productive power, and the falling price just added to it. Note, too, the chart above is for total revenue; since brute computing power is what separates miners, the bigger miners are taking a bigger share of that total, leaving even less for the average miner. We wonder how many other aspiring miners out there are finding that the whole exercise is simply not profitable at any cost.

In its complaint, the commission alleged that the company, which operates under the name Butterfly Labs, had charged consumers thousands of dollars for mining equipment, and then failed to deliver the machines \u201cuntil they were practically useless, or in many cases, did not provide the computers at all.\u201d \u201cWe often see that when a new and little-understood opportunity like bitcoin presents itself, scammers will find ways to capitalize on the public\u2019s excitement and interest,\u201d said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased the court granted our request to halt this operation, and we look forward to putting the company\u2019s ill-gotten gains back in the hands of consumers.\u201d The FTC said it will take questions about the case on its Twitter feed, (@FTC, #AskFTC), at 3 p.m. eastern time. Butterfly Labs has been a consistent source of complaints in the bitcoin community, as well as individual and class-action lawsuits. The FTC, in its complaint, alleged the company started taking orders for its BitForce mining rigs in June 2012, and as of September 2013, more than 20,000 customers had not received their equipment. It started taking orders for its Monarch machines in August 2013, and as of August 2014 \u201chad delivered few, if any, Monarch computers.\u201d \u201cEven where Butterfly Labs did deliver a bitcoin mining computer to a consumer, the complaint notes that because of the unique nature of the bitcoin system, the outdated computers were useless for their intended purpose,\u201d the FTC said. The court order put a freeze on the company\u2019s assets. Butterfly Labs\xa0derided what it called \u201cheavy-handed actions,\u201d though it also said it is cooperating with the government agency. \u201cIn a rush to judgement, the FTC has acted as judge, jury and executioner,\u201d the firm said in a statement that it released Tuesday afternoon. \u201cButterfly Labs is being portrayed by the FTC as a bogus and fake company. To the contrary, Butterfly Labs is very real.\u201d The company said it has shipped $33 million worth of products, has also refunded $17 million in cancelled orders, and was in the middle of shipping out new machines to complete existing products \u201cwhen the FTC effectively closed the doors.\u201d The company said it will ask the court to allow it to present testimony at the Sept. 29 hearing, and \u201cintends to defend our business and our nascent and promising industry.\u201d Bitcoin mining has become increasingly more difficult as the digital currency\u2019s popularity has risen, and to a lesser extent, all the major mining-equipment companies have been facing the same difficult environment Butterfly Labs did. Bitcoin mining is designed to release a steady amount of the currency over time to miners who compete by racing to solve complex mathematical puzzles; right now, it releases a batch of 25 bitcoins about every 10 minutes; miners use increasingly more powerful machines to outmaneuver each other and win that batch of coins. The twist is that as more miners come onboard, the bitcoin algorithm automatically adjusts the difficulty of the puzzle, making it increasingly more difficult to solve. In bitcoin\u2019s earliest days, miners could simply use their desktop computers, but now the difficulty and competition has increased to such a point that increasingly powerful, dedicated machines are required. This has created a race against time with which the mining companies have struggled. By the time they design, build, and ship new mining rigs, the difficulty has increased to such a level that the machines are not profitable when they arrive at the customer\u2019s door.\xa0Many have turned to cloud-based services to offer mining contracts rather than selling just the hardware.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$395.96, down 6.1% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013Bitcoin is getting hammered, marking the culmination of a \xa0rather gloomy summer in the market for the digital currency.\xa0After a 7.35% fall on \xa0Thursday, it is now down another 6%\xa0since that overnight close and has traded Friday at its lowest level since April, according to Coindesk\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index. The clearest explanation for this latest collapse is more technical than fundamental: essentially, there\u2019s been an absence of big new buyers over the past three months, which has given sellers an excessive impact on the price. It is now down more than 30% since June 19 and while the decline has been more gradual, it is now running into automated triggers that are exacerbating the slide. Other fundamental explanations are offered up as well, the most interesting theory being that Chinese bitcoin miners are dumping the digital currency for dollars. Some even speculate that they could be doing so to get into the Alibaba IPO. The first thing to remember is that bitcoin is a \u201cvery shallow market,\u201d says Dan Held, a founder of Blockchain\u2019s market analytics unit ZeroBlock. And because bitcoin is global and unregulated, \xa0\u201canyone anywhere, \xa0even a kid in Bulgaria who mined 10,000 bitcoin two years ago, can mess with that market\u201d by making a few large sales, he says. Mr. Held also notes a perverse negative effect from the ongoing adoption of bitcoin for payments by merchants, most of which immediately swap their incoming bitcoin into dollars. \xa0This doesn\u2019t specifically explain why bitcoin has fallen these past few days; rather it points to a buildup of selling pressure now hitting something of a critical mass. That trigger effect is likely tied to technical factors. The breach of the $450 level midweek is thought to have triggered selling by investors who\u2019d been treating that price as a key support level. What\u2019s more, with new computerized trading strategies available, along with the ability to trade on margin at bitcoin exchanges such Hong Kong\u2019s BitFinex, there has been clear evidence through the summer of price triggers forcing investors to sell to cover margin calls. More of these would have come with the latest declines. This all comes against the backdrop of a lack of buyers, which is in turn partly explained by uncertainty over the regulatory environment, with authorities in both the U.S. and Europe weighing new rules for bitcoin. Still, it is the China theory\u2013 and it is only a theory \u2014 that is most intriguing, in part because it explains a striking anomaly in the bitcoin system: That the summer-long price fall \xa0has coincided with an explosion in bitcoin mining. Over the same three-month period in which the price dropped from above $600 to below $400, there has been a doubling \xa0in the \u201chashrate,\u201d\xa0a measure \xa0of the network-wide computational power with which bitcoin miners compete to solve a mathematical puzzle and win the right to a fresh issuance of 25 new coins at 10-minute intervals. There\u2019s an arms race going on in bitcoin mining. But that begs the question: why would anyone rush to buy mining rigs and pay for ever-greater electricity consumption when both the proportional share and value of the bitcoins you can earn are plummeting? The China theory is one of the few that seems to makes sense of those competing trends. The idea is that some Chinese citizens see bitcoin as a vehicle for bypassing capital controls, which limit them to foreign exchange purchases of more than $50,000 a year. With Chinese bitcoin exchanges scrutinized by officials and with banks barred from servicing them ever since a crackdown in April, yuan-funded investment in mining could be an easier, below-the-radar way to obtain bitcoins and sell them for dollars. Is this happening? Well, we \xa0know a lot of the new mining equipment is coming online in China, where a large number of new ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining rigs are made.\xa0Sources have told us of large mining operations surreptitiously installed by employees of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in factories that enjoy state-subsidized electricity. In some cases, these people say, the rigs are even charged to the company as \u201ccomputing equipment.\u201d If the state\u2019s paying for both your equipment and your power bill, the price of bitcoin doesn\u2019t matter so much. But why now? One argument is that a slowing Chinese economy is driving Chinese investors to seek opportunities in better-performing markets overseas. With government-controlled banks paying deposit rates below inflation, Chinese savers had traditionally put their money in real estate. But for the first time in decades, housing prices are falling, in line with signs of a broader economic slowdown. Note, too, that a recent survey found\xa0almost half of all Chinese with a net worth above $1.5 million\xa0plan to depart the country in the next five years. Bitcoin allows them to transfer their wealth overseas before they leave. The other argument is that this is not a bet against China, but a bet on a particular dollar-based exposure to China:\xa0the Alibaba IPO. This was a\xa0Bitcoin Magazine contributor\u2019s theory\xa0and it might be a bit far-fetched because you\u2019d likely have seen those flows earlier than this. Still, the broader speculation around Chinese SOE-based mining ops is an interesting one rich with irony: it would mean the Chinese government is subsidizing a bitcoin-based workaround of its capital controls.\xa0(Michael Casey) - As regulatory issues take on a greater urgency for bitcoin, the community is responding with both a wider and deeper advocacy effort. This week, two organizational developments reflect this push. One is the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s expansion into representation overseas, the other is the launch of the Washington-based Coin Center, a new nonprofit research and public advocacy group for cryptocurrency technologies. According to an announcement earlier Friday, the Bitcoin Foundation has retained Brussels-based public relations specialist Monica Monaco to represent bitcoin-related interests in the European parliament. The announcement comes with the new European Union parliament forming and in the wake of a warning from the new European Banking Authority that banks should avoid dealing with bitcoin until new EU rules are developed. The Coin Center will be headed by Jerry Brito, formerly a senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center and prominent scholar of and commentator on cryptocurrency themes. For its board, Mr. Brito has also lined up some prominent people associated with bitcoin, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, core bitcoin coder Jeff Garzik, and Stanford University professor Susan Athey. It will start with an annual budget of $1 million with funding from firms\xa0including venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Hudson River Trading, Union Square Ventures and RRE Ventures, as well as from bitcoin service companies such as Bitpay, Coinbase, BitGo and Xapo.\xa0(Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $453.12/ down 2.29 (via CoinDesk) -In a deep-dive report, researchers at the Federal Reserve of Boston \xa0laid out a mostly positive outlook for cryptocurrency technology, though not so much for bitcoin as it is currently designed.\xa0 In a report released earlier this month but which only caught the bitcoin community\u2019s eyes these past two days, the Boston Fed concludes that \u201cthe lasting legacy of Bitcoin most likely lies in the technological advances made possible by its protocol for computation and communication.\u201d Authors J. Christina Wang, a senior economist in the Boston Fed\u2019s research department, and Harvard University economist Stephanie Lo note that this decentralized technology could disrupt a current bank-centric payment system that\u2019s \u201cfragmented\u201d and \u201cinefficient.\u201d They join St. Louis Fed Chief Economist David Andalfatto, who put out a report\xa0on cryptocurrency earlier this year, in specifically acknowledging bitcoin competitor Ripple as a contender for this role. Describing that startup\u2019s network as \u201cessentially a protocol that allows disparate systems to communicate in order to transfer funds and make payments,\u201d the report says Ripple shows that \u201cthe development of new technologies for making payments does not need to be accompanied by a new financial claim\u201d \u2013 in other words, a new digital currency to compete with traditional currencies.\xa0 (Ripple has its own native currency, called XRP, but not every transaction requires it and end users typically don\u2019t trade in it, with most transfers passing only momentarily through XRP. The financial service providers that serve as Ripple gateways can distribute and receive payments in sovereign fiat currencies.) Bitcoin did not miss out on praise. The authors say \u201cit\u2019s conceivable for bitcoin to capture a nonnegligible market share\u201d of e-commerce, noting that despite extreme volatility in its exchange rate, data show that people engaging \xa0in bitcoin\xa0 transactions on average save money over traditional payment methods by avoiding the bigger transaction fees imposed by banks. They especially highlighted bitcoin\u2019s promise in cross-border remittances and while they pointed out thatthis could be held back by underdeveloped personal computing technology and knowledge in developing countries, cellphone technology offers an attractive way around these limitations. Notably, the report takes a critical look at the mining network, a vital component of the bitcoin infrastructure through which its coins are issued and its transaction ledger is updated. The report describes the competition mechanism that has produced a concentration of mining power as one of bitcoin\u2019s \u201cserious design flaws,\u201d raising concern that reduced profitability for small miners will further concentrate power and could undermine the integrity of the system. The authors even raise the prospect of regulation to manage the mining network \u2013 \u201cit suggests the need for enhanced oversight, either by the players themselves or by an independent third party, to guard against the likelihood of collusion or other noncompetitive behavior,\u201d they wrote. Ms. Wang and Ms. Lo also highlight the fact that more high-powered, independent computers could soon be needed to store the large amounts of data that bitcoin\u2019s blockchain ledger of transactions will contain. Based on these concerns, they contend that the bitcoin network, \u201cas originally designed, and especially its associated digital currency, will probably not survive in the long run.\u201d Still, the Boston Fed authors were upbeat about the energetic innovation in the cryptocurrency arena to contend with such challenges and see this innovation building on the breakthrough technology behind bitcoin to eventually have a lasting impact on the workings of our financial system. (Michael Casey) - Roger Ver is taking this bounty thing pretty seriously. After announcing last week that he was setting up a website to help collect information on the person who hacked Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s email, Mr. Ver this week unveiled a site that is aimed at collecting information on hackers and thieves in other cryptocurrency cases as well. It\u2019s called Bitcoin Bounty Hunter, and it\u2019s kind of like a crowd-funding site for solving crime. People can donate to the site to build up bounties, and also submit information on leads. If one of those leads leads to a capture by law enforcement, the tipster can come back to collect the bounty. There are three cases posted right now: the Satoshi hacker (whom Ver says also hacked him last year), the missing Mt. Gox bitcoins, and the Bitcoinica hack. Mr. Ver said people can submit other bounties, although he\u2019ll make final decision on which to post. There are sure to be a host of legal and ethical questions that crop up from this unusual effort, but Mr. Ver thinks ultimately it be a successful endeavor. He said the site has already attracted attention from one \u201cIt certainly has his attention and I look forward to the day he is caught,\u201d Mr. Ver said. (Paul Vigna) - Julian Assagne, the WikiLeaks founder, is promoting his new book, and shedding light on one story that involves bitcoin back in its fledgling days. In December 2010, when WikiLeaks was under pressure from government forces and banks were cutting it off, some folks suggested it start accepting the new digital currency bitcoin. This fired up the libertarian set, who saw two great decentralizing forces working together. It was summed up by one poster who wrote gleefully \u201cbring it on.\u201d One person who didn\u2019t like that idea, though, was Satoshi Nakamoto. \u201cI make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use bitcoin,\u201d Namakoto wrote on the Bitcoin Forum. \u201cThe heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.\u201d A few days later, he wrote \u201cWikiLeaks has kicked the hornet\u2019s nest, and the swam is headed towards us.\u201d (One day later, he would disappear from the forums forever.) Assagne mentioned this incident in a Reddit AMA, and pointed readers to a footnote in his book that discusses it. WikiLeaks, he explains, did consider bitcoin, but heeded Nakamoto\u2019s pleaded and decided against it. The site started accepting bitcoin in June 2011.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $xx,up/ down xx% (via CoinDesk) - We provoked a good deal of debate with last week\u2019s piece on how bitcoin could advance beyond a narrow strategy of retail-focused marketing and instead aim to win over multinational businesses and governments, and when you come down to it, the debate illustrates the fight over bitcoin\u2019s soul. Many people observed that Ripple Labs was already actively pursuing the described strategy and argued it deserved acknowledgment for this. The piece was deliberately framed as a way to think about what bitcoiners can do to promote their currency. It wasn\u2019t intended as a discussion of other cryptocurrency projects, which is why Ripple ended up with only a brief mention. But Ripple enthusiasts have a valid point. When it comes to the strategy we outlined, one where cryptocurrencies and decentralized networks would become the financial plumbing through which big institutions shift money cheaply around the world and so reduce costs in the global economy, Ripple is right there. And it may well prove to be a successful model, so long as it can sign on enough of the \u201cgateways\u201d needed to give its decentralized network the critical mass it needs. Yet the reason why it\u2019s worth exploring bitcoin\u2019s prospects with the same strategy is because, in cryptocurrency terms at least, bitcoin is the grand-daddy of the industry. It has a giant first-mover advantage. As Wences Casares, the CEO of bitcoin wallet and custodial service Xapo, pointed out to us in an interview earlier Friday, in every metric \u2013 market capitalization, transaction flow, users \u2014 bitcoin dwarfs the combined size of the 90 or so \u201caltcoin\u201d networks that compete with it. It\u2019s why people like Casares believe that the race has already been won. Ripple is a quite different in ownership structure and business model from the other altcoins, so it might not be fair to lump it in with these others. But it\u2019s hard to delve into the future of cryptocurrency without obsessing on where bitcoin itself is headed. The debate over our column also highlighted the differences of philosophies within the cryptocurrency world. On the one hand, there are supporters of the angle we took, which appeared to include Ripple fans and, let\u2019s say, a more pragmatic wing of bitcoin, which sees cryptocurrency technology as a tool to reduce costs in the existing system. Although this group shares the passion that the more idealistic cryptocurrency enthusiasts hold for stripping middlemen from transactions and leveraging decentralized networks, they tend to be more agnostic on the issue of currency. The idea is that for bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency to change the world it\u2019s not necessary that it entirely displace fiat currencies, only that its technology be used as the intermediating infrastructure for monetary exchange. On the other hand, those with a more sweeping, idealistic view of the bitcoin \u201crevolution\u201d have a grander vision. It\u2019s a political vision, an ideological vision, a fiercely libertarian and essentially anarchist vision. For this impassioned and, to be fair, articulate group, the angle that we adopted in our column was not an exercise in \u201cthinking bigger,\u201d but of thinking too narrowly \u2013 as one critique of the piece decided to point out. This division is likely to persist no matter bitcoin\u2019s future. But if people like Mr. Casares are correct, the battle for bitcoin\u2019s soul has already been fought, and resolved. (Michael Casey) - If you\u2019re looking for an example of how the blockchain can be used in ways that take it beyond just being a ledger for a currency, the folks over at the University of Nicosia have come up with an interesting treatment. The school, which began offering both an MOOC (massive open online course) as well as a masters-level program in digital currencies, recently handed out academic certificates for graduates of the first course (which was the MOOC), and they embedded the certificates in the blockchain (you can read a technical description of what they did here). This means that students will have a permanent record of their studies, independent of even the school\u2019s record-keeping. (Paul Vigna) - Everybody\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency is getting the graphic novel treatment. \u201cThe Hunt for Satoshi\u201d offers a dramatized version of the story of bitcoin\u2019s founder and its earliest days. A small team of Akex Preukshcat, Josep Busquet, and Jose Angel Ares is producing it, and raising funds via the crowdfunding platform Swarm in order to publish it, if all goes well, by November. So far, they\u2019ve raised about 16 bitcoins and change. The story is described as an adventure graphic novel aimed at educating people about bitcoin \u201cin a fun way.\u201d We saw only the first three pages, and it involves espionage and guns, the NSA and the mafia, all searching for the secretive creator. We\u2019re not exactly sure how that all fits into the bitcoin story, but, hey, it\u2019s a comic book. The team also managed to get Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist at Bitcoin Foundation and leader of the currency\u2019s core developer team, to autograph five copies of the comic, which will be auctioned off.

But there isn\u2019t any kind of standardized base of knowledge for them to draw upon. That gave one man an idea. On Tuesday, the Digital Currency Council, a consultancy and education center that aims to be a resource for legal, accountants, and finance professionals and the\xa0brainchild of David Berger, opened its doors in lower Manhattan. Essentially, the idea is to bring bitcoin\u2019s proverbial three R\u2019s to Wall Street.\xa0The group will offer certificate-level classes and courses designed to provide a broad understanding of digital currencies.\xa0\u201cWe believe advisors, folks who are taking fees to give advice, need to be held to a higher standard of understanding,\u201d Mr. Berger told MoneyBeat. \u201cThat\u2019s really what we\u2019re allowing them to do.\u201d Bitcoin is slowly and quietly starting to look less like a tool of cryptoanarchy and more like a relatively normal financial asset. Last week,\xa0the first derivatives exchange got approval\xa0from the CFTC. PayPal\u2019s\xa0Braintree unit will start taking the currency. A\xa0recent research paper even concluded\xa0that despite its volatility, a small amount of bitcoin can benefit a diversified portfolio. There are two bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the works, one from Barry Silbert and the other from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Given all this, Mr. Berger believes\xa0the time has come for a formalized approach to bitcoin education. Mr. Berger was previously Americas CEO of Campden Wealth, a research and resources firm aimed at high-net worth investors, and it was in that capacity that he saw how many advisors just weren\u2019t up to speed on bitcoin. When he talked to advisors about bitcoin, most either shrugged their shoulders, pleaded ignorance, or were just plain skeptical. But he also saw that individual investors are increasingly looking to their advisors for information about bitcoin.\xa0He saw an opportunity there for somebody to provide standardized knowledge at a professional level. The council\u2019s program has been in beta testing, and already has 200 people taking courses. \u201cThere is definitely demand,\u201d he said, \u201cwell beyond the confines of New York and Silicon Valley.\u201d The council received funding, for an undisclosed amount, from Mr. Silbert\u2019s Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. Mr. Silbert, who is building both his bitcoin ETF and bitcoin exchange, said he\u2019s getting \u201ca lot of questions from the advisors, either because they\u2019re curious or they have clients who are interested in bitcoin.\u201d He said his firm has a \u201cbitcoin 101\u2033 email they hand out, but the idea of a more formalized program \u201cresonated with me.\u201d This may be the first effort aimed at professionals, but it is not the first educational effort for cryptocurrencies.

The charity, which is the largest privately-funded nonprofit in the world, announced a partnership with Coinbase through which it will take donations for its Innovation Fund, as the charity seeks to find new ways to reach donors. The Innovation Fund is an apt place for a cryptocurrency, which aims to use technology to help the charity\u2019s social causes. \u201cWe see this partnership as an opportunity to innovate and help the social sector innovate by being an early adopter of bitcoin donations,\u201d United Way\xa0CEO Brian Gallagher said via email.

By opening up the fund to bitcoin donations, United Way is testing it in one small part of its business. Expedia, for example, started off taking bitcoin for only for hotel bookings, while PayPal began using bitcoin in its Braintree unit. (Paul Vigna) If you\u2019re going to run a major bitcoin mining operation out of your home, you might want to forewarn the local utility company or risk being confused with a\xa0marijuana \u201cgrow house.\u201d That seems to be what happened to bitcoin miner Jonas Diener, 37, of Broadway, Va. This week he received a suspended jail sentence for possessing drug paraphernalia after police were called to his home last year following a tip from an employee at the Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative. The employee had pointed out that Mr. Diener\u2019s house was using eight times the normal electricity consumption for a residence of its size. That led police to suspect the home could be functioning as a marijuana \u201cgrow house\u201d with high-powered lamps to nurture marijuana plants. Whatever marijuana they found was in small enough amounts that drug possession charges were later dropped, but according to statements to local media then from local county sheriff Bryan Hutcheson, the police also found and seized \u201ca very large volume of computer-like equipment.\u201d At that time, Sheriff Hutcheson said the equipment was \u201cnot consistent with what you would find at a residence,\u201d and so it was sent to a crime lab to \u201cdetermine exactly what it is, what it\u2019s all about.\u201d According to a report Saturday in the Daily News-Record of Harrisonburg, Va., Diener\u2019s attorney John Holloran was able to set the record straight in a filing: The computers were used to mine bitcoins, the proceeds of which were all seized in the raid. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the coins were returned.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $472.99 , down 0.7% (via CoinDesk) -\xa0The Satoshi-hack story may be over. We haven\u2019t heard from the hacker who apparently broke\xa0into Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s email in days, and it appears the account\u2019s been locked. Moreover, nobody has paid his bounty of 25 bitcoins for the identity of Nakamoto. It\u2019s not even clear the hacker has it. All in all, it\u2019s looking like one big, nasty prank. The first tip-off that this wasn\u2019t serious was that 25-bitcoin bounty, or about $12,000, said\xa0Catherine Meyer, the senior counsel at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. That\u2019s not a lot for such valuable information, in a world where simple pictures of celebrities can fetch anywhere from $60,000 to $2 million. \u201cA lot of time these guys who want ransom don\u2019t have what they say they have,\u201d she said. \xa0\u201cThis sounds a lot more like the Nigerian scam than anything else.\u201d It\u2019s debatable whether the hacker got any identifying information before being locked out as well. \u201cI doubt that Satoshi could be identified even if all the emails are released,\u201d Michael Marquardt, the Bitcoin Forum administrator, said in an email to MoneyBeat. \u201cHe was always extremely careful,\u201d \xa0said Mr. Marquardt, who goes by the user name \u201cTheymos.\u201d That echoes a thought we offered on Tuesday, that Nakamoto\u2019s publicly available emails and communications never revealed any identifying information. If he used the GMX account solely for bitcoin-related business, there may be 11,000 emails in there that do absolutely nothing to identify him. That said, the account might provide information about past login times and places, which could at least answer whether or not Nakamoto was just one person or representing a group. Or if the ISP addresses were revealed, it could give clues to his/her/their location. If you had access to the account. Yet, if Nakamoto was as careful as Mr. Marquardt suggests, \xa0then a VPN and multiple logins could have been used to disguise locations and throw hackers off the scent.\xa0Essentially, there is a strong possibility that the account contained no information identifying the bitcoin founder. It may all be irrelevant\xa0now. Emails sent to satoshin@gmx.com\xa0have been coming back as undeliverable. We reached out again to the firm GMX that runs the service, but have not heard back. Either way, it appears the account has at least been frozen, if not deleted. Also, the hacker is no closer to his price tag. The\xa0address to which he directed people\xa0still has received only about 1.55 bitcoins. Meanwhile, in an ironic twist, Roger Ver, the well-known evangelist called \u201cBitcoin Jesus,\u201d is offering a reward for anybody who tracks down and identifies the hacker. On Tuesday, he posted this on Twitter: The Satoshi email hacker seems to be the same person who hacked my email account previously. 37.6 BTC Bounty ready! http://t.co/AXVNbWghLC \u2014 Roger Ver (@rogerkver) September 9, 2014 Mr. Ver told MoneyBeat he\u2019s setting up a website that will allow the person who fingers the hacker to collect the reward, anonymously, of course. (Paul Vigna) - Our colleague, Allen Mattich, has wrote up a post summarizing the Bank of England\u2019s first detailed report on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The bank \u201chas touched on bitcoin before but has never opined in this level of detail,\u201d he wrote. The bank doesn\u2019t think bitcoin poses a threat to the financial system, noting that it estimates about 20,000 Englanders use it, but thinks the technology is promising. Addtionally, the bank released this video, a short (4 minutes) explainer on cryptocurrencies:  - Retailer Overstock.com, arguably the most active promoter of bitcoin among large U.S. merchants has just revamped its international site to allow overseas customers to purchase merchandise in the digital currenccy. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne described the move as a milestone for bitcoin, noting that the Overstock\u2019s international site reaches 93% of the world\u2019s population in 108 countries. \u201cFor the first time since the outbreak of World War One, there is a global non-fiat currency that you can use to buy 2 million products from anywhere on the globe,\u201d he said. Mr. Bryne said the revamped international service was coupled with a more sophisticated global logistics operation to make shipping internationally more efficient and added that the company is looking to set up warehouses overseas. One carrot that Overstock is putting before bitcoin enthusiasts to shift their shopping its way: it will donate 4% of all sales with bitcoin\xa0to nonprofit bitcoin-promoting foundations. The first such group to receive money is the newly formed Washington-based Chamber of Digital Commerce and now Overstock is \u201cvetting a number of other ones around the world and [is] going to pick up a number of them,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. Overstock\u2019s international site currently does about $30 million in annual revenue. Discussing previously announced initiatives, Mr. Byrne said Overstock is moving forward with a plan to pay employee bonuses in bitcoin and is working on integrating a payment system so that it can pay thousands of global suppliers in the digital currency. (Michael Casey) - Bitcoin just cannot seem to avoid controversy. The latest kerfuffle came after a file emerged online that contained 5 million Gmail email addresses, and their passwords. The file was traced back to a Russian bitcoin forum. It\u2019s become apparent that the file isn\u2019t exactly what it appears to be. It does contain email addresses, and passwords, but many seem out of out of date, and were likely lifted from sites other than Gmail where gmail accounts were used for logging in.

Well perhaps the biggest authority on that, the Bank of England, has weighed in on the cryptocurrency today, and its conclusion is basically thus: While bitcoins in circulation in the U.K. pose no threat to the financial system, and perhaps never will, the technology raises interesting possibilities that could one day have ramifications for stocks, other financial products and even physical assets like gold. The bank estimates some 20,000 people (of a nation of 60 million at the moment) in the U.K. hold bitcoins. And daily transactions number about 300 or so. As a proportion of the U.K. economy that\u2019s obviously tiny: In all the \xa360 million of bitcoins circulating in the U.K. represent a tiny 0.003% of British broad money balances. All of which means that bitcoin currently represents no financial stability risk to Britain. What\u2019s more, there are reasons to believe that Bitcoin\u2019s relative importance to the economy won\u2019t grow much, the BOE\u2019s economists add. Why? Well, although one of the prime attractions to bitcoin is how cheaply it can be transacted, its design suggests transaction fees would rise with usage and that could limit interest. And its attractiveness as a medium of exchange is also limited by its volatility. With bitcoin\u2019s total supply limited in advance, it won\u2019t be able to respond to normal economic fluctuations in demand. So where a central bank can adjust liquidity to meet economic conditions, a bitcoin based economy would see the electronic currency\u2019s value swing violently. But the bank, which has touched on bitcoin before but has never opined in this level of detail, says all this doesn\u2019t mean its uptake couldn\u2019t change in future. For instance, were people to lose confidence in traditional currencies\u2013as they do under hyperinflation\u2013bitcoin could well become a crucial alternative. Likely? No, extremely unlikely at present, the BOE researchers say. So should we ignore bitcoin as a curiosity? Well, not so fast. And this is where it gets technical. As a technology, bitcoin raises interesting possibilities, the BOE\u2019s researchers point out. Bitcoin\u2019s potential usefulness hinges on its function as a \u201cdecentralized ledger.\u201d What\u2019s that? Well traditional electronic payments systems \u2013used for everything from credit card transactions to sending money abroad \u2014 rely on a central authority to supervise and collate payments which are balanced on a main ledger, where all transactions are recorded and totted up . But bitcoin is different. It is entirely decentralized allowing payment to be made between two individuals without the intercession of an independent agency. Essentially like cash. And it\u2019s relevant that bitcoins are held in electronic \u201cwallets\u201d. Although bitcoin is complex and uses high level cryptography, built into it is a way for users to check that other people\u2019s transactions aren\u2019t fraudulent. That\u2019s an important technological advance that could be a game changer. One day. The bank says it foresees a possible future in which a bitcoin-type decentralized payment structure might well be applied to the existing financial system infrastructure. To, say, allow the equivalent of cash transactions between individuals, but using traditional currencies in electronic form. Or trading shares or other securities. Or applied to physical assets like gold where no centralized ledger currently exists. Could bitcoin or its ilk change the financial world? Maybe. But the BOE researchers suggest precedent with the adoption of other technologies suggests that it\u2019ll be many years before its innovations become widespread or obvious.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Alen Mattich', 'email': 'Alen Mattich'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/09/11/heres-what-the-bank-of-england-thinks-of-bitcoin/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 9, 11, 9, 24), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Here&rsquo;s What the Bank of England Thinks of Bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u' Coinbase, the San Francisco-based bitcoin transactions firm, announced on Wednesday that it is expanding its services to more than a dozen nations across the eurozone, a major push to spread its business beyond its U.S. base.

The company has been actively working on this project for the last four to five months, CEO Fred Ehrsam told MoneyBeat. It involved setting up all the \u201cfinancial plumbing\u201d in each nation, getting its services wired to the eurozone\u2019s cross-border payments network, called SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) and erecting a multilingual customer-support team.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $472.73, up 0.1% (via CoinDesk) - We\u2019re still trying to dig into this Satoshi Nakamoto-hacker story,\xa0and while it seems credible to believe that somebody somehow broke into Nakamoto\u2019s email account, that\u2019s about all that\u2019s clear. The hacker said that if he received 25 bitcoins, he would release the bitcoin creator\u2019s true identity. To prove that he actually had this information, he released screenshots that appear to be of a GMX email account\u2019s inbox, \u201ca little teaser\u201d he called it. The inbox includes emails within the last 24 hours from two journalists, Adrian Chen and Wired\u2019s Robert McMillan \u2013 who wrote a story on the hack \u2013 as well as emails from two bitcoin developers, Gregory Maxwell and Luke Dashjr. Even if he did crack the account, that might not necessarily reveal Nakamoto\u2019s true identity. If the emails in that account are anything like the emails that are already in the public domain (see here and here), they don\u2019t reveal any personal information. The hacker may be in there, but still without any real credible identifying information. So far, nobody seems inclined to meet his asking price, anyhow. The wallet address he listed shows only 1.5 bitcoins have been proffered up so far (which were promptly sent to another address). Most of the transactions, in fact, are for the smallest amount possible, nicknamed (ironically in this case) a \u201csatoshi,\u201d and some of which included profane personal messages to the hacker. Moreover, it may be that the email account has been shut down. We tried four times today to send an email to the account, satoshin@gmx.com. All came back as undeliverable. GMX, the service that hosted the account, has so far not replied to emails seeking comment. Patrick McGuire over at Motherboard has an interesting, convoluted story about trying to contact the hacker, and ending up in communications with two people wrestling for control of the account, one of whom could be the real Nakamoto. If the hacker is ever caught, it could turn into quite the circus. Assuming for the sake of argument the hacker\u2019s in the U.S., he\u2019d be liable to federal prosecution, according to Catherine Meyer, senior counsel at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman \u2013 assuming a prosecutor was willing to take the case, and assuming the real Nakamoto were willing to step forward, since he would be required to prove the account was his and it was compromised. \xa0(Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin did not get even 24 hours to bask in the sun of its PayPal news, before a big, hulking competitive threat busted up the party. The geniuses from Cupertino unveiled Apple Pay at their big, brassy presser on Tuesday, and while it may get lost in the adulation for the new iPhone and the Dick Tracy-like iWatch, bitcoiners should pay particular attention to the payments platform. Apple Pay is not going from zero to 60 in under six seconds, it is going from zero to 220,000. That\u2019s how many stores will be accepting the new mobile system. Launch partners includes banks that collectively represent 83% of payments in the U.S., and chains like McDonalds, Whole Foods, Disney Stores, and Subway. That means this system right off the bat within reach of tens of millions of consumers. Bitcoin purists will scoff, with some justification. Apple\u2019s new product is not a reinvention of payments, an entirely new railroad so to speak, but a very clever streamlining of the existing rails. Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of Coinsetter, lauded Apple for bringing \u201cmuch needed simplicity to consumer payments, with improved security over the current use of credit cards,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t quit there. \u201cThat said, Apple Pay is still built on top of the same old credit card payment networks and banking system,\u201d he said in a statement. Be that as it may, if you look at bitcoin as the future of mainstream payments in the developed world, this is a real issue. Ultimately, all people want is simplicity and safety. If Apple can offer that through its widely distributed platform, its very widely distributed platform, it\u2019s going to divert potential bitcoin customers. Even if there\u2019s still a cost-benefit to merchants from bitcoin, if their customers are all on Apple\u2019s system, it won\u2019t matter. We\u2019re not saying this is a bitcoin killer. In fact, over at Cryptocoin News, they\u2019re looking at the iWatch as the perfect complement to bitcoin to ensure secure payments. We\u2019ll all have to see how it works out in the real world, and for all the iPhones out there, Apple certainly has competitors lined up to hand it its lunch, and billions of people who don\u2019t use their products.

It appears the hacker has obtained control of the email account satoshin@gmx.com, the same email address cited atop the original white paper published by the bitcoin founder in August 2008. Messages from this address have been posted to various online forums and reportedly sent to people in the past 24 hours with content written in a style inconsistent with the founder\u2019s previous public statements. In one of those messages, including one to a Pastebin forum, the poster is promising to release details of the real Nakamoto\u2019s identity if he is paid 25 bitcoins\u2013valued at about $11,700 at current prices. The person or persons going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto stopped all communication with fellow bitcoin enthusiasts in the spring of 2011. Ever since, as bitcoin has grown in use, value and public prominence, there have been numerous efforts to try to identify the founder, none of which have come up with conclusive evidence. It\u2019s not clear this latest episode will resolve that mystery. Even if the hacker, reported by Wired to go by the name \u201cJeffrey,\u201d has control of Nakamoto\u2019s old email address, there\u2019s no proof he or she has access to information that would reveal the bitcoin founder\u2019s identity. An email sent to satoshin@GMX.com bounced back as undelivered. Administrators at GMX, a service that allows people to create emails anonymously, did not immediately respond to requests for information. Neither was it possible to open the links to two \u201cteasers\u201d that the hacker offered as evidence in the post to the Pastebin forum that he had access to information that would identify the bitcoin founder. A bitcoin address that the hacker included in messages is showing that has received 1.53 bitcoins so far, virtually all of which came from a single transaction. That\u2019s the equivalent of about $715. Michael Marquardt, an administrator on the Bitcoin Forum website that Nakamoto helped found, claimed in a post to that forum late Monday to have received a direct email from the hacker. \u201cToday I received an email from satoshi@gmx.com (Satoshi\u2019s old email address), the contents of which make me almost certain that the email account is compromised,\u201d Marquardt wrote, using his own pseudonym username, Theymos. Marquardt was not immediately available for comment. After Marquardt\u2019s message was posted, a message appeared on Tuesday on the forum of the P2P Foundation\xa0that appeared to be a warning to\xa0Nakamoto. But in an ominous twist, it was posted from\xa0the account that \xa0Nakamoto set up in 2009 with the GMX address. It wasn\u2019t clear whether the P2P account had been breached by the same hacker, using the email address to also compromise that account. In the message, Nakamoto was warned that he could be in danger. \u201cDear Satoshi, your dox, passwords, and IP addresses are being sold on the darknet,\u201d the message\xa0said. \u201cYou are not safe. You need to get out of where you are as soon as possible before these people harm you. Thank you for inventing Bitcoin.\u201d The last time a message was posted from Nakamoto\u2019s\xa0P2P Foundation account was in March, when Newsweek claimed\xa0that a California man named Dorian Nakamoto might be the mysterious creator of bitcoin.

Mr. Santori is well known as a top legal authority on digital currencies, and his services were actively sought after by several global law firms and a number of the larger bitcoin exchanges and financial-services companies. Mr. Santori has been the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s regulatory affairs committee, a volunteer role he plans to retain, and in his practice specialized in early-stage, high-tech companies. As such, he\u2019s played a key role in some of the biggest regulatory issues regarding bitcoin, including the response to Benjamin Lawsky\u2018s BitLicense proposal; he wrote and made the foundation\u2019s presentation\xa0at Mr. Lawsky\u2019s January hearing.

(Paul Vigna) - Blockchain wasn\u2019t the only one with news today. Confirming what the Journal reported back in August, Braintree, a unit of eBay\u2019s PayPal, is allowing merchants that use its payments services to accept bitcoin, in partnership with Coinbase. The announcement was made on Monday by Braintree CEO Bill Ready at TechCrunch\u2019s Disrupt conference. Calling it PayPal\u2019s \u201cfirst foray into bitcoin,\u201d he said the quality of wallet services and the demand from merchants has developed to the point where adding a bitcoin option was worthwhile. \u201cWe\u2019re at the right time now\u2026when you can do this in a quality way,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t announce any specific merchants that would be using the service, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if companies like Uber and AirBNB that already use Braintree\u2019s payments systems started offering bitcoin payments as well. (Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin is infamous for its wild volatility, its manic price swings that can send its value hurdling down or surging higher. It is not known as a valuable tool for an investors\u2019 portfolio. But, believe it or not, it may have a role to play there, too. A new paper by Chen Wu, a professor of finance at the University of California at Berkeley, and Vivek Pandey, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Tyler, is making just that case. The pair took up the question of whether bitcoin can play a positive role for investors. They set up a proxy portfolio, with currencies, equities, bonds, real estate, commodities, and even the VIX all represented. They then tested bitcoin in the portfolio. They compared it to other currencies, to see how it performed and correlated, and tested it to see how or if bitcoin added anything to a broadly diversified portfolio. Their conclusion? Bitcoin can help, a bit (no pun intended). Yes, the cryptocurrency is volatile, and yes, its usefulness as a currency and medium of exchange is limited, given its young age, and its high volatility makes it a weak store of value. All that aside, they did find that a small allocation of an investor\u2019s funds to bitcoin did boost the performance of their proxy portfolio. \u201cIndividual investors can benefit from holding a small amount of bitcoins in a diversified portfolio,\u201d they wrote.

The number has fallen most recently to 7,008, according to the bitnodes website. It was above 10,000 in early March. The nodes represent volunteers who hook their hardware into the network in order to broadcast the latest data to the blockchain. The more nodes there are, and the wider the distribution, meaning information gets broadcast across the network faster. \u201cI would like to urge users familiar with provisioning web services on dedicated or virtual private servers to consider running one of the Bitcoin clients,\u201d Mr. Yeow wrote.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $489.47, up 3.15% (via CoinDesk) - Data breaches, identity theft, having your nude selfies swiped from the cloud and published online, these have become normal occurrences in the modern age. Okay, maybe the last applies only to celebrities. But in a digital age, you\u2019re at risk of online theft, whether you\u2019re Kate Upton or just some average Joe buying mums at Home Depot. Can a better mousetrap be built with bitcoin? The answer is a definite\xa0maybe, but it means the entire nascent industry will have to not only build more secure systems, it will have to build more secure systems that can withstand widespread public use, malicious attacks, and overcome the distrust of a skeptical public. That\u2019s a tall order. The irony is that even after the massive Target data breach, even with Home Depot now in the news amid stories about breaches, the existing payments system is so ingrained in people\u2019s daily lives that most people just accept these risks. On the other hand, when it comes to bitcoin, what most people think about is the Mt. Gox scandal. The number of hacks, theft, and cons from bitcoin\u2019s early days are a stain on its reputation. The Mt. Gox scandal may have been about a specific company\u2019s shoddy product but the fact that somebody was able to stroll into Mt. Gox\u2019s servers and stroll out with 850,000 bitcoins left a lasting impression upon the public. The problem, in both the bitcoin and real world, starts with what could be called \u201csingle signature\u201d accounts, where all that\u2019s need to gain access is a password. Passwords are hackable, no matter whether the password is \u201c1 2 3 4 5\u2033 or some long combination of numbers and upper- and lowercase letters. Indeed, it appears that this was the crux of the celebrity-hack scandal\xa0(at least, that\u2019s Apple\u2019s take). \u201d\xa0It\u2019s time we start outright blocking passwords common enough that they can be online brute forced, and it\u2019s time we admit we know what they are,\u201d Dan Kaminsky, a well-known hacker and co-founder of a firm called WhiteOps, wrote in a blog post this week. It\u2019s a problem in the bitcoin world, too. The single point of access is what allowed the Mt. Gox scandal to happen, and every individual who falls for a phishing scam understands this as well. It\u2019s not unusual for some bitcoiners to simply print out their wallet account number and keys and store them offline to completely remove the risk of having them stolen. What\u2019s needed is at least a dual-key system, where two points of access are required for an account, and this is what bitcoin is moving toward. It\u2019s not a guaranteed win, this\xa0article from Bitcoin Magazine\xa0lays out some pros and cons, but it is a move toward a better system. \u201cMt. Gox will never happen again,\u201d said Will O\u2019Brien, CEO of BitGo, a wallet-security firm that counts among its clients the Bitcoin Foundation, Gyft, ZipZap, CoinTerra, and as of today Bitfury. The kinds of more-secure features being developed by his company and others he hopes will eventually form much-needed industry standards. In bitcoin circles, this is called \u201cmulti-sig,\u201d short for multiple signatures, \xa0meaning more than one key, i.e., a password, is needed for access,\xa0and it\u2019s a key feature of BitGo\u2019s service. Coinbase released a new kind of account it calls \u201cthe vault\u201d that features multi-sig. Jeremy Allaire\u2019s Circle Internet Financial\u2019s accounts make use of multi-sig as well. BitPay developed a wallet it calls Copay that makes use of multi-sig as well. One challenge for bitcoin will be maintaining a high level of security as its universe expands. Assuming bitcoin keeps finding new converts, it will become a more tempting target for hackers. There\u2019s no guarantee that it can \u201cscale,\u201d as the techies like to call it, and still provide the level of security its backers promise. Mike Hearn, one of bitcoin\u2019s lead developers, back in January warned \u201csome people think bitcoin is indestructible, when it is not. In fact, is is very fragile.\u201d In the end, whichever industry can convince the general public that it has both the most secure and convenient system is going to have a huge advantage in our so very hackable world. \xa0(Paul Vigna) \u2013Bitcoin mining equipment makers might have a hard time maintaining customer relations in recent years \u2014 what with long delays in delivering pre-ordered rigs. But investors still seem keen on them. At least that\u2019s the story from Stockholm, where ASIC-chip mining rig-maker KnC Miner is based and where it has just announced a new $14 million funding round from venture capital investors. The deal inserts manufacturer KnC Miner, which also provides cloud mining services to people who want to rent computing power mining rigs held in databases, into a small elite of bitcoin businesses that have claimed double-digit funding rounds. The company says its businesses have brought in around $110 million in revenues since its inception in April 2013. Rather than tap Silicon Valley money, the funding round was led by Nordic-based VC firm Creandum and advised by London-based investment bank GP Bullhound. Scandinavia has long been a haven for tech innovation, with\xa0Finland, Sweden, and Iceland all claiming success stories in the sector. And where there\u2019s tech, there tends to be interest bitcoin these days. What\u2019s more, Scandinavia is proving to a popular locale for cloud mining services and other large-scale projects that are taking root in the increasingly industrialized business of mining bitcoin. These firms \xa0are attracted to the region\u2019s low-cost energy and cool conditions, which help to keep high-powered mining rigs from running too hot.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $483.30, up 1.9% (via CoinDesk) - In honor of Hal Finney, the bitcoin pioneer who passed away on Thursday from complications related to ALS, the Bitcoin Foundation is organizing a fund-raising effort in his honor. The foundation, along with Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees of Coinapult, Jason King of the nonprofit Sean\u2019s Outpost, and BitPay, collectively formed the Hal Finney Bitcoin Fund, and will be accepting donations through Thanksgiving. After that, they will take nominations on which ALS charity to donate the money to, and hold a vote. They will donate the funds on Dec. 2. They are also encouraging people to participate in the Ice Bucket Challenge; Gavin Andresen, the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s chief scientist, taped a video on Saturday. Some bitcoiners had already been participating, including Elizabeth Ploshay, a board member of the foundation, and Christopher Franko, a bitcoin enthusiast from North Carolina. Additionally, Armory Technologies, a bitcoin-wallet company, is pledging to match up 10 BTC worth of donations through a funding drive it is also holding. Mr. Finney worked closely with Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2009 to get the first versions of bitcoin up and running. He was diagnosed with ALS in August of that same year, at a time when he and his wife Fran were active marathoners. Over the intervening years, the disease slowly ate away at his body, although it never touched his mind, which remained sharp and clear. Mr. Finney seemed determined to maintain as much of a life as he possibly could. When he could no longer physically run a marathon, he walked across the finish line. When he couldn\u2019t write with his own hands anymore or speak with his own voice, he got hardware and software that helped him continue to communicate with people. The inevitability of his condition did not quell his enthusiasm. His wife, Fran Finney said even recently, he would still find reasons to smile, like when visitors came. \u201cI vow to spend the rest of my life in ways that would make Hal proud and happy,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. (Paul Vigna) - Pantera\u2019s Bitindex continues to rise, even as the price of bitcoin lately is falling. The index, created by the San Francisco venture-capital firm in July, does not measure prices, but a mixture of merchant adoption, hashrate, Google searches and a few other metrics, in an attempt to gauge the level of bitcoin interest in the real world. Bitcoin\u2019s price has been falling. Over the past week, it\u2019s dropped from roughly $520 to $483. Still, the latest reading on the Bitindex points to steady if unspectacular growth. Given bitcoin\u2019s dizzying growing pains, and still volatile price, that isn\u2019t such a bad thing.

One that did was Hal Finney. Mr. Finney, then 53, was an engineer and developer working at a tech company called PGP Corp. in Silicon Valley, which focused on encryption systems. He designed things like an anonymous remailer, an email system that used cryptography techniques to encrypt messages. Mr. Finney was also a member of the cypherpunks, a community of libertarian and even anarchist-leaning techies that formed in the 1990s and were focused on utilizing cryptography to thwart encroaching attacking on personal privacy. Mr. Finney died on Thursday at age 58 from complications related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\xa0(ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, after a nearly five-year fight. He was diagnosed in August 2009. In the spring of 2014, Mr. Finney answered questions from the Wall Street Journal, at a time when he was still able to communicate via email. Even then, it took great time and effort for him to write out his answers, using specially designed software. Over the ensuing months, he lost even that capability. Reflecting on his time working with Nakamoto, Mr. Finney said they never spoke directly, and said he does not know Nakamoto\u2019s true identity, although at the time he assumed he was talking to a young Japanese-American male. The two communicated via email (Nakamoto\u2019s email was, naturally, encrypted), and Mr. Finney saved those emails, some of which he shared with the Journal. You can read them here. They open a small window into the first days of the digital currency, and provide a slight bit of light on Nakamoto himself. The cypherpunks had been focused on digital, anonymous money for years and had build several early systems, all to no avail. Mr. Finney himself had developed a version of e-money in 2004. So when bitcoin first came around in October 2008, most members were dubious. Mr. Finney was an outlier. \u201cCryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs,\u201d Mr. Finney wrote in a 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum. \u201cThey tend to have a knee jerk reaction.\xa0I was more positive.\u201d Mr. Finney replied to Nakamoto\u2019s Jan. 9, 2009, announcement that he had launched bitcoin, and for the next two weeks he worked with the founder to debug the system and get it running properly. Mr. Finney became a key contributor, the first person to work with Nakamoto, to run the bitcoin software, and the first to receive a transfer of bitcoin. The conversations between the men are wholly dedicated to setting up the bitcoin network, and are very technical in nature. In that sense, they don\u2019t shed a tremendous amount of light on Nakamoto. But they do give some measure of the man, and they do open a window into bitcoin\u2019s earliest days. Mr. Finney downloaded version 0.1.0 \u2013 and it crashed, which surprised Nakamoto who\u2019d been testing the system himself and hadn\u2019t had any crashes. But he managed to reproduce the bug, and the faulty code that caused it. \u201cIt was absolutely the last piece of code to go in,\u201d he wrote. \xa0\u201cI\u2019m really dismayed to have this botch up the release after all that stress testing.\u201d\xa0It\u2019s one of the few displays of emotion from him in the emails. They went back forth, through version 0.1.2, and 0.1.3. There were more crashes, more debugging, more rewriting and retooling of the code over and over again. \u201cIt was getting so there were so many zombie nodes, I was having a hard time getting a reply to any of my messages,\u201d Nakamoto wrote to Mr. Finney in one email, while he was simply trying to establish reliable connections between two different users of the system, the other being Mr. Finney. Mr. Finney from time to time was himself pegged as Satoshi Nakamoto, a claim he denied. He also said he didn\u2019t know Nakamoto\u2019s true identity. He never asked Nakamoto to identify himself. Mr. Finney told the Journal in the spring that he does believe it is possible to discover Nakamoto\u2019s real identity, albeit he didn\u2019t have any thoughts himself about who he may be. Mr. Finney also said that he was surprised by bitcoin\u2019s rapid growth, but that he thought it could eventually live up to the hype.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/08/29/hal-finney-and-bitcoins-earliest-days/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 8, 29, 16, 58), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Hal Finney and Bitcoin&rsquo;s Earliest Days'}, {'articleText': u' Hal Finney, a well-known cryptography expert and the first person to work with Satoshi Nakamoto on the digital currency bitcoin, passed away on Thursday in Scottsdale, Ariz.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $509.33, down 0.2% (via CoinDesk) - Coinbase has stirred up a fight in the bitcoin wallet and consumer account service market, all around the topic of insurance for bitcoin holdings. In a post on its blog Wednesday, the San Francisco-based wallet provider belatedly announced that its customers had actually had their bitcoins insured for almost a year. \u201cGiven the recent claims of insurance in the industry, we thought it was appropriate to tell our users about it,\u201d the firm said. It\u2019s not a mundane point. In the wake of Mt. Gox\u2019s collapse it became abundantly clear that customers of cryptocurrency financial services were exposed to risks in a way that customers of traditional services aren\u2019t. There is, for instance, no FDIC insurance for bitcoin wallets. Therefore, the question of insurance is an important one for customers of these firms. Coinbase said its insurance policy against theft and hacking, which was brokered by insurance agent Aon and underwritten by insurers with S&P ratings of at least A+,\xa0 exceeds the average value of the bitcoin it holds in online storage. By extension, this means it doesn\u2019t cover bitcoins held offline in cold storage, roughly 97% of total, though these reside in a far more secure and essentially unhackable setting. Coinbase openly stated that its customers\u2019 bitcoins, though insured, are not fully insured. It then proceed to try and debunk competitors\u2019 claims of being \u201cfully insured.\u201d Without naming names, Coinbase said some wallet providers make the claim without using accredited carriers or when they are \u201coutright self-insuring.\u201d Others are only able to do so now \u201cbecause their number of bitcoin stored are so low that a small insurance policy happens to cover everything until they grow.\u201d The first case is undoubtedly a reference to Xapo, whose website touts its custodial service as a bitcoin \u201cvault\u201d that\u2019s built like a \u201cfortress.\u201d Xapo says all coins are held offline in fully secure cold storage and that it \u201cfully insures your assets.\u201d Xapo says it is insured by a Bermuda-based company called Meridian Global Insurance Limited that\u2019s managed by global insurance broker Willis Insurance but actually owned by Xapo itself. That\u2019s a form of self-insurance but it\u2019s a fairly common and legally robust approach known as captive insurance. Essentially, it means Xapo\u2019s capital is at risk in the event of losses, because the arrangement leaves shareholders unable to ring-fence their investment. \u201cWhatever capital we have goes if we don\u2019t fulfill that\u201d insurance commitment, said Xapo chief executive officer Wences Casares. He said it \u201cwas one approach and it has some shortcomings but it also has some advantages\u201d over the Coinbase approach, which is to insure the 3% of bitcoins online and leave the remaining 97% offline and uninsured. \u201cThat\u2019s another approach and it also has some shortcomings.\u201d The second reference in Coinbase\u2019s no-name critique of competitors would point to Circle Internet Financial, the new depository and account service founded by Internet entrepreneur Jeremy Allaire. In an email response to a question on the matter, marketing manager Josh Hawkins said \u201cCircle provides full coverage for our customers\u2019 bitcoin against loss or theft based on any breach of digital or physical storage. That includes both online and offline (cold storage). Marsh,\xa0a global scale provider,\xa0is our insurance broker and we use highly rated underwriters (AM Best A++, S&P AA).\u201d Coinbase, Xapo and Circle are three of the most well-funded bitcoin startups in existence, each having drawn in more than $25 million in venture capital funding. All compete in the same markets. Xapo\u2019s Mr. Casares said he thought it was appropriate that Coinbase divulged the details of its insurance program, but he didn\u2019t think the criticism was constructive to their shared interest in building the number of bitcoin users to \u201cbillions of people, instead of just a handful of people.\u201d \u201cWhenever\u2026we say bad things about each other, it just hurts all of us together,\u201d he said.\xa0 (Michael Casey) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $513.17, down 0.06% (via CoinDesk) - While awareness of cryptocurrencies is rising,\xa0very few people have actually used them. A new survey, from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the Massachusetts Division of Banks, found that 51% of people in the U.S. were aware of bitcoin and other currencies, albeit only about 3% had said they used it. Still, that\u2019s a big change from earlier this year. Back in February, another survey found that about three-quarters of the population hadn\u2019t heard of bitcoin, and 80% said they\u2019d never even consider using it. The CSBS survey was taken in May, and canvassed 1,000 online consumers. Some of the findings aren\u2019t surprising; men, for instance, were more likely (64%) than women (38%) to be aware of virtual currencies. Only a limited number said they\u2019d buy or use them \u2013 65% of the overall respondents said they were \u201cunlikely\u201d to ever use them. Younger respondents were more likely to have purchased bitcoins or other currencies, and Hispanics (30%) and African Americans (24%) were also more likely than whites (14%) to be willing to purchase virtual currencies. While people in households where the income is over $100,000 were more likely to have heard of bitcoin (70%) than those in lower-income households (43%), they were less likely to say they\u2019d purchase bitcoins (11%) than those in households with incomes of less than $100,000 (19%). (Paul Vigna) - This sounds like a really, really bad idea. The world of cryptocurrencies, being such a nascent thing, is full of ideas. We hear them all the time. Ideas for new coins, ideas for new businesses, ideas to put bitcoin into space. Some are fascinating, some are interesting, some are just plain loopy. But one idea takes the cake. A couple from somewhere, there are precious few details,\xa0has started a crowdfunding project to help raise their baby \u2013 promising to name the girl Satoshi Bitcoin if they raise the 150 bitcoins they\u2019re angling for. The project is up on Bitcoin Starter, a crowdfunding site for cryptocurrencies. So far, it has no pledges. We can sympathize, to a point. Raising a child these days is expensive, and new parents can use all the help they can get. But can you\xa0imagine the problems on the playground that name would carry for a young child? \u201cSatoshi\u201d is a normal enough name \u2013 for a Japanese boy. Satoshi Bitcoin is just odd for a girl, who would spend her entire life living down her parents\u2019 oddball stunt. With any luck, this project will die, and they\u2019ll just name her Dolores. Besides, they\u2019ve already been beaten to the proverbial punch: the first \u201cbitcoin baby\u201d was born last year, to parents who paid for the\xa0frozen embryo transfer cycle\xa0in bitcoin. (Paul Vigna) - It\u2019s always seemed like a no-brainer to us: if the cost of electricity necessary for bitcoin is so expensive, well, why not try and cut those costs by going green? One miner apparently had the same idea,\xa0according to a report in CoinDesk.\xa0DigitalBTC, an Australian firm, signed a multi-year contract with a U.K. firm, Verne Global, that specializes in green data centers.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $510.99, up 1.9% (via CoinDesk) - The amount of hardware being thrown at bitcoin mining continues to rise, but if those mined bitcoins aren\u2019t being used, \xa0an imbalance between supply and demand will develop that may increase volatility in the price, CitiFX\u2019s Steven Englander wrote in a note. The number of transactions have been stable this year,\xa0in a range between 60,000 and 80,000 a day, according to data from Blockchain. That\u2019s a huge jump from under 10,000 a day two summers ago. The problem is the number of transactions has plateaued at those levels, but \xa0the amount of mining activity keeps increasing. The degree of difficulty in mining \u2013 the built-in adjusting mechanism that makes solving the bitcoin algorithm harder as more miners come onboard \u2013 has jumped twice recently, and the hashrate, a measure of total mining activity, has been rising as well. \u201cThis uninspired demand side may interact with the rising costs of mining, which has become a very specialized and capital intensive industry,\u201d Mr. Englander said. \u201cFor now we have miners looking to sell and not much of anyone looking to buy.\u201d Mr. Englander thinks this will make \u201cextreme volatility\u201d inevitable. It seems to us that it could result in miners simply hoarding their mined bitcoins rather than sell at low prices. Either way, the real key here seems to be the transaction flow, and right now at least it\u2019s pretty stable \u2013 which for bitcoin isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. (Paul Vigna) - Korbit, a South Korean bitcoin exchange, raised $3 million in Series A funding, with the round led by SoftBank Ventures Korea, and in the U.S. by Pantera Capital. Other investors included BAM Ventures, Bitcoin Opportunity Corp., Tim Draper, Pietro Dova and Strong Ventures. The company, which began in April 2013, operates an exchange, and offers wallet and merchant-processing services. It raised $400,000 in January. (Paul Vigna) - Speaking of mining, you can mine cheaply, to be sure, but can you do it profitably?\xa0A new service from GAW Miners offers cloud-mining contracts for as little as $16, according to a post on Inside Bitcoins. The question they pose is whether you can make any money at that low price. The company calls these contracts \u201cHashlets,\u201d and proclaimed in a forum post that \u201cthere will never be a time a Hashlet cost more to run than you make, and they will always make money.\u201d Given the legion of problems that have bedeviled the mining industry, that kind of a claim is going to raise immediate flags. That $15.99 price buys you on megahash (a measure of processing power); customers can buy more if they wish. Inside Bitcoins did a back-on-the-envelope assessment, and figured you could make your money back in about two months, however they were concerned about those increases in the level of difficulty,\xa0\u201cwith the most recent one being quite significant.\u201d That could cut into the profitability of the Hashlets, they argue. The bottom line here is that the more miners that come online, the harder it gets for everybody to mine, and the lower the payouts \u2013 unless you spent the considerable sums to corral enough hardware to offset the rising difficulty. The trick becomes spending enough to keep ahead of the competition, and turn a profit.

From Expedia to Dish Network to Dell, there are plenty of those. But we\u2019ve never heard of a company saying it won\u2019t accept dollars. Until today, that is. We were intrigued by a story online, reporting that Denver-based precious metals dealer Amagi Metals said that by the end of 2016, it will no longer accept dollar-denominated business, and will do all of its business in cryptocurrencies (or gold, of course). Surely, that couldn\u2019t be. Why would any retail business decide not to accept the world\u2019s most widely distributed and widely used currency? We had to talk to somebody at the company, to see if this story was right. Yeah, it\u2019s pretty right. \u201cI\u2019m a big advocate of sound money,\u201d CEO Stephen Macaskill told us over the phone. The dollar, no longer backed by gold, is controlled by \u201cpolitical whim,\u201d he said. It\u2019s not a currency he wants to hold. Okay, that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s his opinion. But that\u2019s different than stating you won\u2019t accept dollars. We pressed him, sensing a fudge. Surely, we asked, on Jan. 1, 2017, if somebody wanted to hand you dollars for gold, you wouldn\u2019t turn that business away, would you? \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a very different world in five years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty close to the last leg of the dollar.\u201d Ah, ha, but five years is not two years. So, we asked again: in 2017, if the dollar\u2019s still here, would you really not accept it? \u201cI don\u2019t want to be left holding dollars when they\u2019re not valuable.\u201d Mr. Macaskill thinks the dollar\u2019s going to go the way of Zimbabwe. He thinks the greenback\u2019s going to collapse, and disappear, and bitcoin is going to rise up in its place and become the world\u2019s de facto currency. Mr. Macaskill is both a gold bug and a bitcoiner, and is positioning his business now for it. Well, that\u2019s, like, your opinion, man. Amagi Metals has been accepting bitcoin since 2012, and cryptocurrencies comprise roughly 30-40% of its business, which is all done online, so it\u2019s already further toward being a complete bitcoin business than most other retailers. But that is still different from saying you will not accept U.S. dollars. We pressed again. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a point when I will turn away business for dollars, and that\u2019s going to be 2017,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re not going to change that position.\u201d Huh. Well, okay, then. Mr. Macaskill did offer one caveat: if the dollar were to \u201cevolve,\u201d if the U.S. government were to back it with gold \u2013 or a cryptocurrency \u2013 so that it stopped losing value, he\u2019d still take it. Ah, ha! (Paul Vigna) - St. Petersburg is going coco loco for bitcoin.\xa0The city on Florida\u2019s west coast may not be anybody\u2019s idea of a bitcoin hotbed, but it does seem like affection for the cryptocurrency is growing. Today the St. Petersburg Museum of History announced that it will start accepting bitcoin, according to a story in the Tampa Bay Times. The museum, the oldest in Pinellas County, dating back to 1922, would reportedly become the first in the state to accept the cryptocurrency. The museum is looking to draw a little action from another prominent bitcoin-related event in the area: the 2014 Bitcoin Bowl \u2013 formerly known as the Beef O\u2019 Brady Bowl.

The game will be played Dec. 26.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $522.37, up 2% (via CoinDesk) - Your hard work paid off, bitcoiners: you got an extension.\xa0The New York Department of Financial Services on Thursday announced that it will grant a 45-day extension to the open-comment period for its \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal, in effect doubling the timeframe. The new deadline is Oct. 21. The move represents a minor victory for the bitcoin community, which has made getting an extension one of its top goals. We spoke briefly with DFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky, and came away with the feeling that he is cognizant about keeping the proposal from overstepping its bounds, that he does want to strike a balance between financial regulations and innovation in a nascent industry. \u201cWe feel strongly about a lot of the provisions,\u201d in the proposal, he said, \u201cand their importance, but we are not the kind of agency that believes we have a monopoly on the truth, we don\u2019t have the kind of authoritorial pride that we\u2019ll not make smart changes.\u201d He mentioned several times that he was impressed with the quality of the comments he was seeing, and that the agency was considering them \u201cquite seriously.\u201d He stressed that the BitLicense was not intended to cover software companies, an impression that\u2019s become a general opinion and concern in the industry. He said they might include an \u201cFAQ\u201d attachment, frequently asked questions, in which they make it clear that software companies will not be subject to the rule.

A petition that was signed by a who\u2019s-who of bitconers \u2013 including Barry Silbert, Brian Armstrong, Tim Draper, Jeremy Allaire, Jesse Powell, Erik Voorhees, Elizabeth Ploshay and several hundred others \u2013 was mentioned specifically by Mr. Lawsky as part of the reason behind the extension. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see the NYDFS show a willingness to listen to the bitcoin community\u2019s request for an extension of the comment period,\u201d said Austin Walne, who posted the petition. \u201cIt\u2019s a great first step toward a more collaborative approach to regulation.\u201d (Paul Vigna) \u2013So, after making your peace with the bland price action of the early summer, now you\u2019re all jittery about bitcoin\u2019s sudden return to volatility. Well, Gil Luria has some soothing words for you: Embrace the volatility, it\u2019s bitcoin\u2019s friend. For all those, including us, who\u2019ve argued that for bitcoin to become a real, viable currency it will require price stability that doesn\u2019t scare the general public away from it, the Wedbush Securities analyst has a counterpoint: volatility breeds trading profits, which in turn begets more trading, he points out, and all that activity encourages the build-out of \u201cthe payment network infrastructure and monetary base that will facilitate increased economic activity in the future.\u201d Trading, Luria says in a new research note, is best thought of as \u201cbitcoin\u2019s killer app.\u201d Volatility is not only welcome but to be expected for a cryptocurrency whose range of possible outcomes runs the gamut from being rendered obsolete by some superior cryptocurrency technology in the future to becoming the world\u2019s dominant monetary force and the \u201cglobal working capital of trade,\u201d the analyst says. His interpretation of that breadth of possibilities converts into a long-term target price range of zero to $1,000,000. \u201cThis broad set of outcomes means any small change in perception regarding the likelihood of the best case outcome drives significant changes to current valuation,\u201d Luria wrote. \u201cSaid otherwise, if market perception of the likelihood of the best case outcome changes by 0.01%, that could drive a $100 change in current valuation, or &gt; 10% in today\u2019s prices.\u201d But do merchants and consumers really want to transact in a currency whose volatility makes the price of gasoline drop by 90%, as the gas-for-bitcoins price did between August and December last year, and then jump by 55% over the following four months? Well, the way Luria sees it, they won\u2019t have to worry. Merchants are already \u201cshielded,\u201d he says, and consumers likely will be in the future. Just as retailers can opt to have bitcoin-based payments immediately converted into dollars by their processor, so too will wallet makers and others service providers create options allowing consumers to quickly convert into bitcoin to make payments with minimal cost, he predicts. (Mike Casey) - The island that once was sold for beads and blankets is going bitcoin. The first bitcoin ATM to operate in Manhattan will be unveiled this afternoon, at a retail boutique called Flat 128 on Christopher Street in lower Manhattan. The machine will be operated by a company called PYC Bitcoin and is a Lamassu model. It\u2019s somewhat surprising that Manhattan hasn\u2019t yet gotten one. Zach and Josh Harvey, the brothers that founded Lamassu, showed off their prototype machine in the city last May at EVR in midtown. They\u2019ve sold about 250 of the machines globally since then, but not one in New York City. We\u2019ll be headed down there this afternoon to see one of these things in the wild, so to speak.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $503.95, up 3.5% (via CoinDesk) - The three biggest bitcoin exchanges in China have weighed in on a critical regulatory proposal on the other side of the planet, submitting comments on the New York Department of Financial Services\u2019 \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal, in a gesture that shows just how far Benjamin Lawsky\u2018s regulatory arm could reach. Bobby Lee, Lin Li, and Mingxing Xu, the CEOs of, respectively, BTC China, Huobi, and OKCoin, submitted a joint letter on Wednesday to the New York Department of Financial Services, a copy of which was given to MoneyBeat. The department is in the middle of a 45-day open comment period. All three think the outcome of Lawsky\u2019s efforts will be felt across the globe, and therefore wanted to add their voice to the process. You can read the letter here. \u201cEven though we\u2019re far away,\u201d Mr. Lee told MoneyBeat, \u201cthe U.S. is still the leader of the free world, and New York is the leader in the financial services space.\u201d What regulators do in New York, he said, will influence what regulators do in China. Moreover, the think their businesses could come under the regulation\u2019s purview as they expand their operations outside of China. The BitLicense proposal has come under increasing fire from the bitcoin industry. Several petitions and requests for an extension of the open-comment period have been filed. As well, last week Circle\u2019s Jeremy Allaire publicly said that the proposal was too draconian, and\xa0if implemented as proposed would force him to \u201cgeofence\u201d New York, essentially blocking New York residents from its online services. What was initially seen generally by the bitcoin community\xa0as a prudent response to virtual currencies is now being seen as something far more restrictive. Mr. Lee isn\u2019t so concerned. \u201cRegulatory proposals are always a little bit stricter to begin with,\u201d he said, and expected that after the DFS collected feedback it would loosen some of the requirements. That\u2019s incumbent, of course, upon there being feedback. \u201cYou want to react properly and not let it slide,\u201d he said. The joint letter focused on three parts of the proposal: - On the definition of \u201cvirtual currency business activity,\u201d the group felt it was too broad. \u201cThe BitLicense proposal would arguably subject the companies to licensing requirement even if they engage in trivial amounts of business with New York residents. A single New York customer would be sufficient to subject each of the companies to the full suite of regulatory requirements.\u201d This could hamper the companies\u2019 ability to develop services outside of New York, they said. - On the obligation to open up affiliates\u2019 operations to review by New York regulators, the group felt \u201ca licensee\u2019s affiliates should have no obligation to allow the NYDFS to examine their respective facilities, books and record that are unrelated to the licensee\u2019s operations.\u201d - On due diligence, the proposal is designed to require what\u2019s being called enhanced due diligence on non-U.S. citizens but not U.S. citizens. The idea is that U.S. business will have a harder time vetting overseas customers and meeting \u201cknow your customer\u201d anti-money laundering rules.\xa0But for foreign businesses, that requirement would turn the logic on its head: an Australian business, for example, would have to perform enhanced due diligence on Australian customers, whom it likely knows better, but not on U.S. citizens. \u201cThese outcomes are likely unintentional,\u201d the group writes, and asks that the trigger for an EDD be whether or not the customer is in the same country as the company. \u201cWe look forward to assisting the NYDFS in its endeavor to make the BitLicense regime an exemplary framework that thwarts financial crimes, safeguards customer assets and unleashes the enormous potential virtual currency and its underlying blockchain protocol have to offer,\u201d they wrote. Mr. Lawsky was not immediately available for comment.\xa0(Paul Vigna) - Chain, a cyrptocurrency software developer, has lined up a $9.5 million round of funding, led by Kholsa Ventures, with investments from RRE Ventures, Thrive Capital, and SV Angel. It\u2019s gotten quiet on the fund-raising front lately, but this shows that the Valley is still hot for these \u201cbitcoin 2.0\u2033 ventures. Our Mike Casey wrote the story, which you can read here. - Bitcoins are not money, not in Australia at least.\xa0The Australian Tax Office released its guidelines on cryptocurrencies, saying it regards bitcoin not as money, but as noncash or barter transactions. In choosing not to acknowledge bitcoin as money, it joined the IRS, which this spring declared bitcoin would be considered property for tax purposes.

The funding round is led by Khosla Ventures, whose investment partner Keith Rabois, a cofounder of PayPal Inc., will join Chain\u2019s board. It also includes additional money from Chain\u2019s early backers RRE Ventures, Thrive Capital and SV Angel, as well as first-time contributions from new investors such as Kevin Ryan and bitcoin entrepreneur Barry Silbert. Chain builds APIs (application programming interfaces) for clients that want to run applications on top of the core software programs that run decentralized cryptocurrency networks and form the foundation of their all-important \u201cblockchain\u201d transaction ledgers. These applications can go far beyond the currency and payments function for which bitcoin and other digital currencies are mostly known. They include a host of services designed to remove third-party middlemen such as banks, stock exchanges and lawyers from commercial dealings and other exchanges of assets and information. There is no shortage of ideas for these new applications. They include \u201csmart contracts\u201d that automatically execute signatories\u2019 obligations without requiring outside adjudication, \u201cdecentralized exchanges\u201d for investors to trade securities peer to peer without a central clearinghouse, and even user-run social networks, a kind of decentralized Facebook, where ad placements and revenues are controlled by those who create the content. The problem, says Chain founder Adam Ludwin, is that any firm or nonprofit that wants to build one of these applications has to create and maintain \u201cnodes\u201d \u2013 the autonomous computers and servers that comprise a cryptocurrency\u2019s independent network \u2013 and have them process vast amounts of transactional data. Chain, which launched in January, seeks to remove the headache from all that, allowing firms to outsource the intensive number-crunching to its specialized servers and enterprise software programs. The company builds out the \u201crelatively complicated infrastructure\u201d needed to runs these applications so that its clients \u201cdon\u2019t have to think about the back office of their services,\u201d Mr. Ludwin says. \u201cMy view is that bitcoin is going to bring a lot new things to the table but not everything will need to be re-invented\u201d to do that, he adds Ludwin says that for now the firm is focused on building applications for the bitcoin network but the same model can apply to new cryptocurrency blockchains that have been built or are under construction such as Ethereum, the Ripple payments network and Ripple\u2019s new competitor Stellar. In fact, new Chain board member Mr. Rabois emerged as a key investor and player in Stellar when its founder, Jed McCaleb, who also co-founded Ripple, launched it last month. His presence in Chain is likely to draw attention. After PayPal, Mr. Rabois\u2019 career included a stint as chief operating office at Square, the firm that provides mobile card swipe services for merchants to run card payments through smartphones and tablets, and he was an early investor Stripe, a developer of payment APIs that\u2019s now working closely with Stellar. Mr. Silbert says Chain is \u201clike Stripe or Twilio [an API developer for text and voice messaging smartphone apps], but for bitcoin.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $484.36, up 5.1% (via CoinDesk) - It\u2019s Demo Day at Silicon Valley\u2019s Y Combinator, one of the best-known \u201caccelerator\u201d projects, and one of the start-ups making their presentation today is an interesting cryptocurrency company called Shift Payments. Shift marks the latest effort in the bitcoin industry to expand the avenues through which people can spend their bitcoins. The firm was founded by Meg Nakamura, Eugene Otto and Greg Kidd, and the idea is simple: to produce a debit card that links all of a user\u2019s bank accounts, whether it\u2019s for cryptocurrency or with a traditional bank, making those funds available to spend virtually anywhere.\xa0The company is currently running a beta program with 100 cards. The user opens up an account, which allows them to link to wallet services like Coinbase, as well as loyalty programs, and, eventually, traditional banks. \u201cShift is the browser for your money,\u201d Ms. Nakamura told MoneyBeat. There is a big push in the bitcoin world right now to find ways for people to spend their bitcoins out in the \u201creal world,\u201d and link them closer to traditional banking systems and models. Jeremy Allaire\u2019s Circle does this, as does Xapo\u2019s debit card. Kenya\u2019s BitPesa uses bitcoin\u2019s protocol, but delivers cash in Kenyan shillings. With Shift\u2019s card, merchants won\u2019t see a \u201cbitcoin card,\u201d they\u2019ll see only a debit card that works like any other traditional debit card. It\u2019s designed to connect the cryptocurrency world with the real world\xa0as seamlessly\xa0as possible. Bitcoin users, importantly, won\u2019t see any added costs of going through traditional payment rails; merchants still pay the interchange fees, Ms. Nakamura said, and the company gets its revenue from a cut of that fee. The \u201cYC,\u201d as it\u2019s called, has shepherded companies like reddit, airbnb, Scribd, and Dropbox. It runs two sessions a year, in which the start-ups are put through a three-month boot camp of sorts. Companies are provided seed-funding, mentoring, and networking. At the end of the program, the companies make their pitch\xa0at demo day to an audience of investors. Mr. Nakamura said demo day was \u201creally fun, totally hectic.\u201d She said she had a number of good conversations with investors and now will be focused on fundraising while her team works on the product, with a larger beta in the works. \u201cFingers crossed, it all goes well,\u201d she said. (Paul Vigna) - That \u201cflash crash\u201d didn\u2019t leave a lasting scar bitcoin\u2019s price. As you can see above, the price of bitcoin is up today, around $484, a day after three trades on the BTC-e exchange went off at $309. Trading volume is still high, at more than 13,000 coins, although that\u2019s down sharply from Monday, when volume was over 25,000 coins. So, yes the proverbial knife fell, but turns out it wasn\u2019t so sharp. Meanwhile, we noticed the \u201chash rate,\u201d a measure of how much computer power is deployed in mining, shot over the 200 million giga hash rate. This rate has been rising steadily, but this rise is a spike no doubt, jumping from 160 million yesterday. If that rate is rising much faster than the number of new players, i.e., fewer people just employing more computing power, somebody\u2019s getting squeezed on how much they\u2019re making from mining. (Paul Vigna) - Africa got its first bitcoin ATM.\xa0A start-up called ZABitcoin ordered the machine from Lamassu in February, and this weekend installed it in a salon in Johannesburg called Metroman Men\u2019s Salon. The machine is a one-way cash-to-bitcoin model that was Lamassu\u2019s first product. There were already bitcoin ATMs in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Lamassu has sold 250 machines in 45 countries.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $458.77, down 6.9% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin prices on Monday plunged \u2013 on a single exchange \u2013 in what\u2019s being called a \u201cflash crash\u201d of the digital currency, after what appears to be a cascading series of trades that occurred in rapid fashion took the price of bitcoin all the way down to $309. Even within the volatile world of bitcoin trading, what happened Monday was unusual. Prices were under pressure early. They started off the morning around $500, and began trending downward. A little bit before 8 a.m. New York time, though, there was a massive plunge on the BTC-e platform, and only there.\xa0Data provided to us by the analytics website TradeBlock showed that there were actually three trades that went off at $309, for a little more than one bitcoin in total, as well as at least 20 trades before and after those three that went off at $310. Well more than a thousand were recorded between $400 and $309. In three minutes around those three $309 trades \u2013 from 7:42-7:44 a.m., there were 1,554 individual trades worth a total of 1,273 BTC,\xa0according to the data, in a pattern that looks very much like automated trading. That may not sound like very high volume, but there are entire days when the trading volume is only around 5,000 BTC. Volume on Monday was already above 26,000. All of that took place on the BTC-e exchange; the low on Bitstamp was $445. The low on CoinDesk\u2019s index was $435. It\u2019s currently at $458.77. On BTC-e, the most recent trade went off at $443.99. BTC-e is an opaque exchange \u2013 It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s located in Bulgaria or Cyprus, and the people running it keep themselves out of the public eye. The site notes its located in a \u201cEuropean time zone (GMT +2), which includes both locales. Our colleagues at MarketWatch described it as a \u201cblack hole\u201d in a February profile, even as it became one of the biggest of the bitcoin exchanges. The exchange does, however, offer some of the more complicated, and risky, kind of trading options that the big capital-markets exchanges offer, like margin trading and shorting. It\u2019s entirely possible, as happened last week, that the initial trading was triggered by a margin call, forcing somebody to dump their holdings. That could\u2019ve sparked a cascade of buy and sell orders. It\u2019s hard to imagine otherwise why somebody would sell at that price. Also, it\u2019s not the first \u201cflash crash\u201d on BTC-e: a similar swan dive occurred in February, sending the price from $600 to $100 in a matter or minutes. Trades in bitcoin don\u2019t get unwound. That\u2019s one of the key features, once a trade is confirmed in the blockchain, it\u2019s set in stone. Absent some kind of overriding glitch, the trades are the trades. In other words, somebody took a bath today, and on the other end, somebody, ahem, cleaned up. \xa0(Paul Vigna) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/08/18/bitbeat-a-bitcoin-flash-crash-as-volume-spike-briefly-takes-price-to-309/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 8, 18, 15, 29), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: A Bitcoin &lsquo;Flash Crash&rsquo; As Volume Spike Briefly Takes Price to $309'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

The volume, at more than 13,000 bitcoins traded, is still higher than it\u2019s been in recent months, but it\u2019s down from the 25,000-range it had been in earlier this week.

Well, they may be getting one now, unless it turns into a different bit of market hyperbole \u2013 the \u201cfalling knife.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin\u2019s cryptoanarchists are getting rowdy.\xa0The cryptocapitalists are busy parrying back and forth with regulators like New York\u2019s Benjamin Lawsky over just how much oversight is healthy for the nascent digital currency and the industry that is growing up around it. Indeed, this has become one of the major continuing story lines revolving around bitcoin. But that clash, between digital capitalists and regulators, is happening on one side of the bitcoin divide. There\u2019s an entire other side of the bitcoin diaspora that isn\u2019t even in that fight, and now they\u2019re speaking up. A new video surfaced this week \u2013 \u201cthe Declaration of Bitcoin\u2019s Independence\u201d \u2013 and it includes a number of the movement\u2019s more libertarian figures, including Roger Ver, Charlie Shrem, Max Keiser, and Overstock\u2019s Patrick Byrne, reading from an essay of the same title by the writer Julia Tourianski, who runs a website called Brave the World.  \u201cIt has become necessary to dissolve the bond between currency and institution,\u201d the essay states, echoing some of the language of the original Declaration of Independence. In the video, numerous speakers take turns reciting from the essay, which is ultimately a rejection of and challenge to the cryptocapitalists. \u201cBitcoin is not intended to be integrated; it\u2019s intended to be a ghost outside the machine. The voices of the people who are working to preserve the purity of bitcoin\u2019s ethos are being drowned out.\u201d This cryptoanarchist group has been losing ground for more than a year now to the cryptocapitalists. When Benjamin Lawsky held his January conference about virtual currencies, and the attendees were almost entirely from the latter cohort, it appeared that this group had pretty much won out. It\u2019s not clear that anything\u2019s changed, although it\u2019s also not clear that anything needs to change. It\u2019s entirely possible that bitcoin is malleable enough to support both wings of the community, those who want to remain underground and those who want to embrace the wider community, even if the anarchists don\u2019t see it that way. (Paul Vigna) In the News: -WSJ\u2019s Greg Bensinger reported Thursday evening that Ebay is in talks with Coinbase and other bitcoin payment processing companies to possibly incorporate bitcoin into its Baintree payments subsidiary, a part of EBay\u2019s PayPal unit. The deal would not cover all merchants accepting PayPal but rather that use Baintree\u2019s special software, including companies such as Uber and Airbnb. Even without a full-Paypal deal, this would be an important score for bitcoin. (Michael Casey) -The Next network has reportedly taken a big blow\xa0with a theft by hackers of $1.65 million worth of NXT, the Bitcoin 2.0 platform\u2019s internal cryptocurrency. Coindesk reports that a developer at BTER.com, the China-based exchange from which the coins were stolen, has already identified the wallet into which the stolen coins \u2013 some 51.67 million\u2013 were transferred. \xa0In a tweet, the exchange said it is determined to catch the guy and get the coins back. Even so, the news appears to have knocked almost 10% off the price for NXT since Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Next, which has built its own independent network and a unique \u201cproof of stake\u201d system for confirming transactions and issuing new NXT to miners, had been attracting significant attention \u2013 before this news, mostly positive. It has attracted a number of developers that have installed their own products and digital assets on the NXT platform. (Michael Casey) - Another online music service is now taking bitcoin. Radical.FM announced on Friday that it will start accepting bitcoin donations, following the announcement in July from Grooveshark that it, too, was accepting the currency. The site is not ad-supported, and runs on a \u201cpay what you can\u201d basis, meaning that it\u2019s essentially free. You might think that\u2019s an automatic money loser. In fact, the general assumption is that online radio is unprofitable, but the site\u2019s founder, Thomas McAlevey, rebutted that notion in an essay in Billboard. He argued that sites like Pandora and Spotify are putting marketshare over profitability (sort of like Amazon), and that the industry\u2019s future is actually much brighter than is generally assumed. It will be interesting to see how bitcoin fits into that bright future McAlevey outlined.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $513.03, down 5.6% (via CoinDesk) \u2013Another day, another selloff.  Bitcoin\u2019s price sure has taken a battering these past two days, and after our cursory attempt to get to the bottom of it Wednesday, more details have come to light about what\u2019s behind the digital currency worst week since the spring. Those details speak to the risks of introducing sophisticated trading techniques to a market that is globally integrated yet also highly illiquid and fragmented. On forums such as Reddit, there has been widespread discussion among traders of margin calls being imposed on rather large leveraged investors. Analysts also cited that activity as being behind the latest fall, \xa0along with a statement Thursday from Circle Financial in which the prominent bitcoin depository service said it might have to block New York residents if the state\u2019s proposed new \u201cBitLicense\u201d is introduced. If the margin calls are true, it would mean that the combination of the Circle news and these technical factors created a cascading effect of self-reinforcing sales as price drops triggered automatic the sell orders needed to repay margin loans. This in turn created a cycle in which new price declines led to additional margin-call triggers. Margin investing, by which an exchange purchases securities on an investor\u2019s behalf and provides a loan to finance that investment, is a staple of stock investing, but it\u2019s pretty new to bitcoin.The leveraged investment strategy can increase returns on an investment if the price rises but equally it can exacerbate losses if \xa0it falls. If the price falls to such a level that the investment is in the red, the exchange that lent money and purchased the security on the investor\u2019s behalf will demand that the investor put up more money or collateral. \xa0If that isn\u2019t forthcoming, the exchange will often automatically sell the asset. Earlier this year, Hong Kong exchange BitFinex started offering margin trading services to bitcoin investors. Then a couple of Beijing-based exchanges offered versions of the same. Chinese and Hong Kong exchanges have also introduced bitcoin futures trading, automatic algorithmic trading, and the capability for bearish investors to short-sell the digital currency, a service that was until recently rarely available in bitcoin. These features could over time eventually enhance stability in the bitcoin market, as the capacity to take positions on either side of a trade allows people to cover their risk with hedging strategies. But as we noted yesterday, bitcoin is still a very thinly traded market \u2013 perhaps made even thinner by summer trading effects. Bitcoin is also a highly fungible asset that can be easily transferred anywhere in the world, ensuring that price effects in one exchange will be quickly reflected in others. Far from enhancing stability, then, margin trading can create exaggerated price movements everywhere. In a market too illiquid to count on buyers stepping in at lower prices, margin call-triggered price declines can continue for some time. That\u2019s what bitcoin\u2019s like. All that\u2019s needed to trigger these self-perpetuating responses is for someone to have an excuse to sell in the first place. And there has been no shortage of those. In addition to concerns over New York\u2019s BitLicense and other regulatory initiatives, Bitcoin 2.0 startup Ethereum\u2019s move on Friday to start converting to dollars some of the almost 27,000 bitcoins it received from a recent fundraiser also stoked concerns about the price. \xa0 - Dish Network\u2019s bitcoin option went live on Thursday, with a notable couple making the first purchase. While the company made the announcement in May, it waited for a scheduled tech upgrade on its website to make the bitcoin option live. To commemorate the occasion, the company invited Austin and Beccy Bingham-Craig \u2013 the couple that last summer spent 100 days living on nothing but bitcoin \u2013 to New York City to make the first purchase of a Dish subscription using bitcoin.  It was an interesting little event (we were the only media in attendance, for the record), with the Craigs sitting in New York\u2019s Central Park this morning, signing into their new Dish account from Ms. Craig\u2019s tablet computer and making the payment right there. You can the auspicious event for yourself in the above clip. Dish has a reputation for being a corporate maverick, which explains the interest in bitcoin in the first place, and searched around for a notable personage to help with the launch.\xa0The Craigs made a name for themselves with their experiment, and are finishing up a documentary about it, \u201cLife on Bitcoin.\u201d They\u2019re planning to submit it to a few film festivals, and release it at some point in 2015. At the time it made the announcement, Dish was the largest company to start taking bitcoin, and while Dell later took that title, it\u2019s still one of the biggest corporations to embrace the cryptocurrency. \xa0(Paul Vigna) - Andrew Hemingway, the New Hamsphire gubernatorial candidate, is taking his bitcoin alignment a step further, with a week-long fund raiser that starts Thursday aimed directly at the bitcoin community. Called BitBomb603 (the 603 representing the state\u2019s area code), the candidate will be taking donations for six days and three minutes, with the goal of raising $100,000. The gambit \u201cwill demonstrate the heretofore untapped political power of the digital currency community, especially in the light of the outcry over the State of New York\u2019s recent BitLicense,\u201d the candidate\u2019s press flak wrote, which we think is a clever way of both buttering up the community, and taking a shot at a fat, unpopular target \u2013 even if it\u2019s from a state hundreds of miles away. It will be interesting to see not only how much money he raises, although the eventual level may say as much, or as little, about the candidate as it does the bitcoin crowd. We\u2019ll also be curious about where it all comes from. Will a \u201cbitcoin candidate\u201d draw support from out of state? That would be interesting.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$544.94, down 4.1% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013It\u2019s the Murphy\u2019s Law of market reporting: once a financial journalist publishes a story noting some striking new price trend, the market will \xa0do something to render the story outdated. Perhaps we should have remembered that when we penned last Friday\u2019s column welcoming the \u201cboring\u201d stability of the bitcoin price over the summer. Ever since Monday, bitcoin has been under pressure, and today the floor got pulled out from under it. At one point, Coindesk\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index got as low as $524.33, down 7.7% from Tuesday\u2019s close. It has since rebounded a bit and is now off \u201cjust\u201d 4.1%, but that kind of whiplash is discomforting to anyone who\u2019d bought into the thesis that the digital currency was starting to exhibit the stability that would bolster its appeal as a medium of exchange. People tend not to like currencies whose exchange rates swing like this, not when its\u2019 a frequent event. Why the rush for the exits? As is often the case in a market that\u2019s still woefully under-serviced by financial professionals and analysts, it\u2019s hard to get a clear read. It may just be the drumbeat of gloomy-ish news: the ongoing malaise over the tougher-than-expected New York \u201cBitLicense,\u201d a rather large theft by hackers last week, and the Consumer Financial \xa0Protection Bureau this week\xa0adding to a wave of regulatory warnings on bitcoin. Perhaps that pushed a big holder into a tipping point that prompted some portfolio trimming. There was also some talk that this tweet could have prompted a mini bout of panic. Dear Bitstamp customers-please make sure you use our updated banking details when sending your transfer to Bitstamp. \u2014 Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) August 13, 2014 Ever since Mt. Gox got on the path to its eventual ruin, Slovenia-based BitStamp has been the most important bitcoin exchange in the world, used by both retail and commercial market participants, including some of the biggest bitcoin payment processors. So, as with Mt. Gox news, BitStamp news has the capacity to move the market. In this case, the news seemed little more than an innocuous exercise in customer relations, something that should under normal circumstances breed no suspicion. But some investors were potentially worried that BitStamp had been forced to change its banking partner against its will. Slovenia is a euro-zone member country, so some may have speculated that its bank was spooked by the recent warning from the European Banking Authority, the euro-zone\u2019s banking supervisory body, against dealing with bitcoin businesses. BitStamp officials did not immediately respond to email and phone messages seeking comment. So, unfortunately, we can\u2019t shed any more light on this admittedly thinly formed theory. The bottom line is that bitcoin is still an illiquid market, which means price moves can be exaggerated. Analysts at TradeBlock have pointed out that technical factors in the price chart left it vulnerable to a breakdown of buying support if it crossed below $550. Such technical analysis is, of course, more common in the stock market, where chartwatchers look for patterns that can signal where share prices are headed next. This illiquidity, and the vulnerability to volatility that comes with it, is yet another precautionary reminder against prematurely trumpeting a new era of bitcoin stability and mainstream acceptance. While wallet adoption is clearly growing and merchants continue to sign up to be paid in bitcoin, transaction flow through the network currently averages around $50 million per day at current exchange rates. That compared with the $30 billion that was processed daily by Visa and Mastercard last year. Such statistics \u2014 and Murphy\u2019s Law \xa0\u2013 will in the future give us pause when covering this unpredictable market. (Michael Casey) -The latest to join in the mounting barrage of criticism toward New York Department of Financial Services\u2019 proposed \u201cBitLicense\u201d is Circle Financial\u2019s Chief Technology Officer and co-founder Sean Neville.  And what a scathing attack it is. In a blog post, Mr. Neville says the proposal drafted by New York financial services superintendent Benjamin Lawsky makes the path to mainstream adoption of bitcoin \u201cworse, not better.\u201d\xa0He warns that Circle, along with other bitcoin businesses, \u201cmay be forced to block all New York residents from using our services.\u201d What\u2019s telling about this is that Circle, one of the best-funded startups in the bitcoin industry, is\xa0as well-connected to the banking and regulatory establishment as you can get.

In a separate blog post, also published today, Mr. Allaire says that if the BitLicense were to be adopted as a template by other states, \u201cit would be devastating for the industry.\u201d (Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $568.18, down 0.9% (via CoinDesk) \u2013Does the cryptocurrency industry need a Moody\u2019s or an S&P? So-called Bitcoin 2.0 technologies \u2013 those bitcoin-inspired software applications that bypass financial middlemen and allow almost any asset to be digitized and traded over a decentralized computer network \u2013 are encouraging an explosion in new digital currencies, tokens and crypto-securities. The problem for investors is that this proliferation of \u201calt-coins\u201d raises a dilemma that bitcoin and its imitators were supposed to overcome: who do you trust? Enter Coinist, which this week launched a beta version of its new service to rate firms, currencies and digital assets in the expanding Bitcoin 2.0 industry. \u201cIt dawned on me that pretty soon we are going to be deluged with assets of varying quality and then the question becomes, \u2018How do you tell them apart?\u201d said John Whelan, Coinist\u2019s founder and CEO, of his motivations for launching the service. This launch comes amid the rapid development of a range of Bitcoin 2.0 platforms encouraging people to launch new decentralized businesses for trading assets and information. Some, such as the Mastercoin, Colored Coins and Counterparty projects, allow third-party issuers to trade their digitized assets over the existing bitcoin network in transactions that are entered into its public ledger, known as the blockchain.\xa0Others, such as Next, and the still-under-development Ethereum platform, have built entirely new networks and blockchain ledgers\xa0independent from bitcoin \xa0A third model is that developed by Ripple Labs and its new competitor, Stellar, whose networks are managed by financial firms functioning as gateways that\xa0sell services to people who want to cheaply trade and send digital assets. Coinist will seek to rate many of these individual platforms, gateways and asset issuers, Mr. Whelan said. The firm\u2019s methodology is still in development, but Mr. Whelan, who has experience as an options trader in Chicago, says its ratings will draw from a mix of eBay-like user assessments, algorithmic data analysis from the various blockchains, and specialized ratings from his company. Through that process, Coinist will ask questions about \u201cthe quality of the assets and the ability of a third-party issuer to deliver against them,\u201d Mr. Whelan says. This is needed, he says, because counterparty risks arise when investors put money into digital offerings that are listed on these new cryptocurrency networks by third-party entities. These assets, tokens and digital IOUs\u2013which cover everything from securitized property deeds to financial derivatives to, in one case, tradable tickets bearing the right to attend a musician\u2019s concerts\u2013still largely depend on the ability and willingness of the issuer to deliver on the underlying promise. That sets up a potential problem for investors who might wrongly assume that their interests are protected by the decentralized cryptocurrency infrastructure. Although that system can automatically authenticates and facilitate transactions across the network, without users having to trust a third-party middleman, it can\u2019t necessarily vouch for the trustworthiness of the issuing entity. \u201cThe whole concept of trust and the notion of \u2018trustlessness\u2019 or \u2018trustless assets\u2019 can be a little misleading,\u201d said Mr. Whelan, who points out that for all the cryptocurrency industry\u2019s efforts to reduce dependence on \u201ctrusted entities\u201d such as banks, credit cards and lawyers, the creation of these new products inevitably requires that investors trust someone. Hence the need for ratings. Mr. Whelan says if the quality of an issuer is not fairly and objectively assessed, investors could be exposed to problems that not only hurt that investment itself but jeopardize the entire network. That\u2019s an idea familiar to bitcoin investors who lost money when the digital currency\u2019s price plunged earlier this year in response to the collapse of Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox. (Michael Casey) - The U.S. Consumer Finance Protection Bureau\xa0has a message for prospective investors in bitcoin: be careful out there. In a consumer advisory published this week, the agency said dipping into cryptocurrenices exposes one to a world of hackers and scams, affords fewer protections, possibly even unexpected costs, oh, and the price may fluctuate wildly. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know what can go wrong,\u201d the agency wrote. The warning reiterates criticisms that have been raised elsewhere. It\u2019s worth noting that\xa0the agency also announced it is accepting consumer complaints from people who have a \u201cproblem with virtual currency or a virtual currency company.\u201d MarketWatch\u2019s Priya Anand sat down at the MoneyBeat desk this morning to talk about the warning.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $577.69, down 2% (via CoinDesk) - Blockchain has doubled its wallet base in just seven months, the company announced this morning. It crossed the two million mark on Monday, twice the one million wallets it had in January, and it makes the company the first to achieve that mark. It also shows that, despite the dearth of big headline stories this year, interest in bitcoin continues to grow rapidly. It\u2019s certainly growing faster than the company anticipated. \u201cThe one thing that we\u2019ve seen about projections is that growth usually exceed our projections,\u201d Peter Smith, Blockchain\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview with MoneyBeat Monday. Mr. Smith said the company hit the two million mark about two months earlier than they\u2019d expected. The company has worked actively to meet that torrid pace. It acquired rights to the bitcoin.com web address in the spring, revamped and released its Android wallet app, and at the end of July, it re-released its Apple iOS wallet app, which in just about two weeks has been downloaded more than 41,000 times, the company reported. Peter Smith, Blockchain\u2019s chief operating officer, dropped in on the MoneyBeat desk to talk about it, and what this means for the industry: Mr. Smith attributed the gains to general interest in bitcoin, as well as the acquisition of bitcoin.com, which has become a \u201cmajor user-acquisition channel for us,\u201d and a relaunch of most of its core software, with an eye toward making it more consumer-friendly. (Paul Vigna) - On paper, India looks like a bitcoiner\u2019s dream.\xa0The country has the world\u2019s second-largest population. It has half a billion \u201cunbanked\u201d poor people and an enormous global diaspora of Indian emigrants, representing a giant potential market for digital remittances and payments. It also has a couple of hundred million tech-savvy middle-class citizens, the kind who should be ready and able to embrace, develop and promote cryptocurrency technology. So, what\u2019s India\u2019s problem? Why is the country not at the forefront of the digital-currency revolution? One problem is awareness, says Vikram Nikkam, a co-founder of India\u2019s Unocoin, which provides digital wallets, bitcoin trading and payment processing services. Once Indians start to learn of \u201chow easy it is to obtain and use bitcoin\u201d to reduce payment costs, adoption will grow, he says, with the first movers to be found among India\u2019s IT titans in hubs such as Bangalore, Hyderabad and Mumbai. Yet the slow uptake also stems from an underdeveloped currency-exchange infrastructure, says bitcoin entrepreneur Barry Silbert, whose Bitcoin Opportunity Corp. has just invested $250,000 in Nikkam\u2019s company. \u201cThe catalyst that will drive bitcoin adoption in India is significantly more liquidity and trading in and out of rupees,\u201d Mr. Silbert said. \u201cNo one is going to use bitcoin to send money to their family in India if there is no way to use it or no place to exchange it.\u201d Mr. Silbert said he fished around for opportunities in India and decided that Unocoin, whose bitcoins-for-rupees trading service is facilitated by solidly functioning banking relationships, was best placed to tackle this problem. Bitcoin got off on a bit of rocky start in India from a regulatory standpoint, too. Last year, the Reserve Bank issued stern warnings about trading in bitcoin and moved to shut down various operators accused of being in breach of the Foreign Exchange Management Act. Unocoin itself was temporarily suspended at that time. However, Nikkam says the firm has since liaised extensively with regulators and has ensured that customers engage with it through banks rather than in cash. The firm, which enforces its own anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer compliance procedures, is no longer concerned about a regulatory crackdown, he said. Meanwhile, India still has inflation problems hanging over from a scare two years ago, which in theory could present bitcoin as an alternative store of value to the country\u2019s historically preferred save haven, gold. The problem, says Mr. Nikkam, is that \u201cpeople are too relaxed\u201d about inflation and have an attitude where \u201cthey want to sit back and let the government handle everything.\u201d This too, though, will be overcome with education, he said, confidently predicting that Indians will come to realize bitcoin\u2019s benefits as a way to take charge of their money.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$591.51, up 0.7% (via\xa0CoinDesk) A flat-lining, stable market isn\u2019t as headline-grabbing as the soaring climb that bitcoin experienced last fall or the precipitous decline it saw in the following four months. But, ironically, the most interesting thing about bitcoin\u2019s market price over the past two months may be the fact that it has been rather boring. It\u2019s starting to exude the kind of dull trading patterns that critics say are necessary if the digital currency is to prove itself as a medium of exchange. Yes, bitcoin\u2019s price has slipped since its 2014 intraday peak of $676.75 on June 1, but if you look at a year-to-date chart of Coindesk\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index (above), the period since then makes bitcoin look (almost) like a normal currency. In their weekly Bitcoin Letter, Pantera Capital\u2019s Dan Morehead and Ron Glantz point out that although bitcoin\u2019s price fell 8% in July, its volatility has fallen by 42% over the past three and a half months. This followed an especially tumultuous trading period in the wake of the Mt. Gox exchange\u2019s collapse. \u201cAs Bitcoin matures and the technology develops, we believe there will be increased confidence and diminished uncertainty,\u201d the Pantera team wrote. \u201cWe expect this to create a positive feedback loop in which volatility declines and consumers become increasingly comfortable holding and using bitcoin in their daily lives.\u201d That\u2019s the glass-half-full view, of course. On the half-empty side is the fact that for many people, interest in bitcoin is still about the prospect that it could go \u201cto the moon\u201d in a hurry. Bitcoin advocates in China, for example, told us that the market there is dominated by speculators with very little interest in seeing the digital currency evolve as a payments or money transfer vehicle. This speculative crowd could very well retreat if bitcoin loses its volatility, much as there could be less interest in mining, whose profitability continues to be challenged by tougher competition for bitcoins and high electricity costs. Still, bitcoin has proven to pretty resilient in recent weeks. Those 8% declines could have been much bigger given the negative response to the New York Department of Financial Services\u2019 \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal, which has been widely criticized in the bitcoin community for being discriminatory against smaller startups. \xa0Neither has the price been hurt by fears that cryptocurrency startup Ethereum\xa0might offload the giant intake of 25,000 bitcoins raised in a presale of its internal tokens. (This might be because demand for \u201cether,\u201d as those tokens are known, is still running hot, driving fiat currency-based investors to buy bitcoin so that they can get in on the sale. The great Ethereum unwind may still be ahead of us.) It would be na\xefve to think that bitcoin isn\u2019t in for more rocky days at some point in the future. There\u2019s been a pattern of mini-crises, followed by stability, throughout\xa0 its short history. But stability could have a self-reinforcing positive impact. Flushing out the \u201cTo the Moon\u201d crowd might be just what the doctor ordered for bitcoin to gain respectability and mainstream acceptance.\xa0(Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$581.52, down 0.89% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013It\u2019s two weeks into new \xa0Ethereum\u2019s \xa0one-and-a-half-month fund-raising and already the cryptocurrency startup \xa0can boast one of the most successful crowdfunding exercises in history, with the equivalent of $12.7 million raised. The Zug, Switzerland-based firm is developing a software platform that will use a network of computers similar to bitcoin\u2019s in order to decentralize all manner of economic activity. Developers are being encouraged to design special software applications that will exploit that network and its transparent \u201cblockchain\u201d public ledger in order to remove middlemen and keep costs down when people or companies exchange funds, assets and information. Among the ideas being floated is an Ethereum-based, decentralized Facebook-like product in which users would have complete control over their personal pages, allowing them to derive advertising revenue rather than foregoing it to a centralized company. Other ideas involve securities markets that run without a central stock exchange or clearing house, contracts that need no lawyer for implementation, or tamper-proof polling and voting platforms that produce a perfect vote count without a pollster or electoral body handling the ballots. The concept has stirred great interest among techies. \xa0And that helps explain the success of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cpre-sale\u201d of ether, the digital coin-like tokens \u2014 or \u201cfuel,\u201das it describes it on its web site \u2014 that will be needed for third-party software applications to run on the platform. The tokens, which are yet to be issued and carry no governance rights or claims to dividends, are being sold in unlimited quantity according to a sliding scale of fixed prices quoted in bitcoin. The first, two-week round, which concluded at 6 p.m. EDT Tuesday, set the price at 2,000 ether per bitcoin. Now buyers will get 1,970 ether for each bitcoin tendered and the amount will drop by 30 ether each day after that until the sale ends on Sept. 2. Late Tuesday in New York, total ether sold stood 43.75 million, representing 21,878 bitcoins or $12.7 million, based on the latest Coindesk bitcoin index price. The previous 24 hours saw a surge in orders as last-minute buyers sought to lock in the lower price. The total exceeds the estimated $7 million raised in an April digital-currency offering by decentralized computer storage provider Maidsafe and beats nearly all other dollar fundraisers on popular crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter. According to Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, early orders have come from software developers and financial entities looking to develop Ethereum-based applications as well as from buyers betting on future demand for the tokens. As per Swiss law, the pre-sale is described not as a security or currency offering but as a product release. It treats ether as a form of software, on the grounds that developers will need the tokens in order to distribute information via transactions over Ethereum\u2019s network and so implement their software applications. Mr. Lubin said third parties are currently building \u201chundreds\u201d of prospective applications on top of the Ethereum platform. These include digital currency exchanges, digital wallets, decentralized messaging programs, business reputation marketplaces and self-enforcing \u201csmart contracts.\u201d Ethereum is the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, who drafted its white paper last year at age 19. Buterin\u2019s idea was modeled on bitcoin\u2019s core infrastructure, whose decentralized network and blockchain \xa0ledger obviate the need for fee-charging \u201ctrusted\u201d third-party intermediaries, such as banks and credit card companies, in peer-to-peer electronic money transfers. But Mr. Buterin felt bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure was too limiting to support the full range of possible applications that these projects offered. So he came up with Ethereum, with an entirely new, independent blockchain and network of miners.\xa0(Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$586.92, up 0.24% (via\xa0CoinDesk) -As U.S. and European Union banking regulators seek greater control over bitcoin, they might want to watch what\u2019s happening in Switzerland. The neutral European nation is becoming a \u201cmecca\u201d for financial cryptography, says Chris Odom, the Chief Technology Officer at Monetas and the founder of the decentralized Open Transactions platform for encrypted financial tools. (Cryptography is the computer science upon which bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are founded.) And partly that\u2019s because they\u2019re finding a more welcoming environment legally. In his latest video update on Monetas\u2019 expansion, Mr. Odom announced that he had finally moved his family from Austin, Texas, to Zug, Switzerland to be with the rest of the company\u2019s team and help build the German-speaking region\u2019s \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d Who are his new neighbors? Well, \u201cright up the road,\u201d is Ethereum, which like Monetas is developing a decentralized platform for financial, economic and social services, in its case one that outside developers can use to create new software applications that bypass middlemen such as banks and lawyers. Ethereum is currently in the second week of a six-week \u201cpre-sale\u201d of ether, the digital currency-like financial tokens needed to run its network, and has so far attracted more than $7 million worth of bitcoin-denominated commitments through that offering. Also near Monetas is Bitcoin Suisse, a bitcoin ATM provider. And among various non-financial cryptography projects, Odom cites ProtonMail, which provides decentralized, securely encrypted email, Threema, a secure version of What\u2019sApp, and Silent Circle, whose BlackPhone project aims to provide secure, encrypted mobile telephony. All are effectively working to protect people\u2019s privacy by blocking third parties such as telephone carriers and Internet Service Providers from snooping on communications. Why the growth in Switzerland? Odom attributes it to the country\u2019s \u201clegendary neutrality,\u201d as well as its respect for privacy and security \u2014 two big buzzwords for cryptographers \u2014 and the fact that it is already a tech hub for established names such as International Business Machines Corp. and eBay Inc . He points out that outside of its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters, Google Inc.\u2019s biggest engineering office is in Zurich. It also likely helps that Swiss regulators have so far taken a relatively accommodative, hands-off approach toward bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. In a recent report, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, known as FINMA, the same regulatory body that has been imposing stringent new capital rules on big banks such as UBS and Credit Suisse, said it didn\u2019t intend to draft special rules for bitcoin because the digital currency\u2019s presence was currently \u201cinsignificant.\u201d FINMA said existing rules on money laundering and illegal behavior would suffice. While they might wince at being seen as \u201cinsignificant,\u201d this minimalist stance is music to bitcoin startups\u2019 ears \u2014 especially in comparison to what some new, smaller startups regard as the onerous new compliance requirements that the New York Department of Financial Services has proposed with its new \u201cBit License\u201d initiative. (Whereas larger, well-funded bitcoin businesses such as the investment fund created by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have more or less welcomed New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky\u2019s initiative as a legitimizing development, smaller players say it creates an innovation-stifling barrier for new entrants. There\u2019s also concern that the NYDFS has granted just 45 days for respondents to submit comments.) The Swiss stance is also much friendlier than that adopted among the banking regulators of Switzerland\u2019s EU neighbors. The new European Banking Authority issued an opinion in early June recommending that banks under its purview stay away from bitcoin businesses until new regulations are drawn up. While regulators in New York and Brussels are devising new ways to rein in the bitcoiners, their industry is doing what it always said it would do and moving to jurisdictions with a lighter touch. Right now this game of \u201cregulatory arbitrage\u201d is playing out in Switzerland\u2019s favor. (Michael Casey) \u2013An executive from giant credit card company Visa Inc. has made some comments to the Australian Financial Review that open the door just a crack to the prospect of having it work with bitcoin. Whereas Visa\u2019s leadership has in past tended to downplay bitcoin\u2019s relevance, Sam Shrauger, senior vice president of digital solutions, said its network could in the future process payments in \u201cvirtual currencies to the extent that that makes sense.\u201d In those comments, which were picked up by Coindesk, Shrauger was quick to add that Visa is \u201cnot thinking about [incorporating bitcoin] today.\u201d Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Gox and Ripple, unveiled his latest, much anticipated cryptocurrency project on Thursday, a user-friendly product that aims to encourage mainstream adoption of digital money. Mr. McCaleb\u2019s new project is a network system called Stellar that promises a bridge between the virtual and traditional currency worlds . It will use a decentralized network of computers run by so-called \u201cgateway\u201d institutions \u2013 banks and other financial firms \u2014 to cheaply and efficiently manage and authenticate a public record of transactions. Those gateways provide the exchange services that allow outside customers to send money to others anywhere in the world. Mr. McCaleb is media-shy, almost never talking to the press, but is well-known in the bitcoin community. He started Mt. Gox in 2010, which grew to become the biggest bitcoin exchange in the world before it collapsed this year after he\u2019d sold it to Mark Karpeles. He also co-founded Ripple, a payments network that borrows some of bitcoin\u2019s ideas to facilitate cheap, efficient transfers of funds and assets denominated in any currency. In unveiling Stellar, Mr. McCaleb ends months of speculation. Until now, the project was known only as the \u201cSecret Bitcoin Project,\u201d with enticing references made to it in a single-page web site of the same name. Like bitcoin and Ripple, the Stellar network will operate with an open-source protocol, meaning anybody can work to improve the software. Also as with bitcoin and Ripple, it will have its own internal digital currency, called stellar. But Stellar is consciously different in some key areas. One key difference is that 95% of the currency is being given away for free at the outset, the bulk of it from an initial issuance of 100 billion coins created by the not-for-profit foundation that will run the project. New coins will be later added at no cost to the circulation at a rate of 1% per year. The decision to give away nearly all the coins was colored by Mr. McCaleb\u2019s experience with Ripple, whose benefits as a groundbreaking technology were sometimes overwhelmed by the suspicions of digital-currency investors, some of whom derided it as a \u201cpre-mined\u201d scam. Whereas new bitcoins are constantly being brought into existence by \u201cminers\u201d who receive them as rewards for confirm transactions across network, Ripple Labs created the entire issuance of 100 billion of its own coins, known as XRP, in one fell swoop, retaining a large portion for the company and its founders. That was done so that a separate foundation, called OpenCoin, could coordinate release of XRP over time to designated gateways. But it inevitably created suspicions among some cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Mr. McCaleb himself had a falling out with Ripple Labs management and he left the company in 2013. Then, in May, he announced that he would be selling his entire stake of XRP coins, a public display that drove down their price and which some in the market dubbed the \u201cJedageddon.\u201d In an apparent attempt to distance itself from such internal conflict, Stellar is being built on a model of giveaways. \u201cWe think of it like ICANN,\u201d says Joyce Kim, the Stellar Development Foundation\u2019s executive director, referring to the group that oversees the Internet protocol. \u201cThere are certain things that can\u2019t be owned by one company.\u201d Of the 95 billion coins to be distributed, half of those will be available free to applicants who place orders via Facebook. The other half will be reserved for charities working in the fields of economic development and poverty alleviation and non-profits that are early adopters of digital money. As with Ripple, a key selling point for Stellar will be that it allows people to make payments with traditional currencies while using the efficiency of a cryptocurrency network to lower costs and speed up processing. \u201cThis is probably the best way to bring the best of both worlds together,\u201d said Ms. Kim. The Stellar Development Foundation\u2019s board is comprised of Mr. McCaleb, Keith Rabois, the former COO at smartphone credit card swipe provider Square, and Patrick Collison, the CEO of Stripe, a maker of software for payment processing.. The development team is led by Mr. McCaleb and David Mazieres, a Stanford professor who heads up the school\u2019s Secure Computer Systems group. Advisors include Dan Kaminsky, Joi Ito, Greg Stein, Jackson Palmer, and Naval Ravikant. Ms. Kim said the hope is that developers in different nations will tailor products and services around Stellar that will best serve their local communities. The biggest goal of Stellar, she said, is to spur adoption of cryptocurrencies, with the team focused on overcoming three specific hurdles: education, access, and volatility. With other digital currencies, \u201cyou either put money in or you have to mine for it,\u201d Ms. Kim said, and that \u201celiminates most of the world.\u201d Stellar\u2019s goal, she said, is to make it cost-free for people to acquire a virtual currency.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $573.69, down 1.5% (via CoinDesk) - Wikipedia now takes bitcoin. Coinbase, one of the big bitcoin service providers, signed up the Wikimedia Foundation as a client and announced it is offering its merchant services for free to all nonprofits. Wikipedia is one of the most heavily trafficked sites on the web, and seems a natural fit for bitcoin as a payments system, seeing both are powered by a decentralized network of users, so it\u2019s a wonder it took this long. In a press release on its website, Wikimedia explained that it had been asked in the past to take bitcoin, and those requests combined with recent events, including the IRS guidance on bitcoin, convinced it to revisit the cryptocurrency. \u201cThere is [now] a clear understanding of how to legally manage it,\u201d Lisa Gruwell, the chief revenue officer of Wikimedia, wrote in the post. Interestingly, another big services provider, BitPay, also announced a new pricing plan for merchant services on Wednesday. It is now offering an entry level service plan that has no costs (professional service plans that offer more features, and carry a charge). The company said the move to make the entry-level plan free was to encourage merchant adoption, especially for small businesses, and to push toward its goal of enrolling 1 million merchants by the end of 2016. That\u2019s a lofty goal \u2013 it currently counts about 60,000 merchants as clients \u2013 but it\u2019s got two and a half years to reach it. It\u2019s interesting to us that both these big service providers are making some form of their services cost-free. Seems like a new push to sign up the merchants that will be critical in driving the currency\u2019s usage. (Paul Vigna) - The Bitcoin Foundation has a fancy new website.\xa0The old site was a dowdy, utilitarian creature that lacked panache. Not so anymore. The new site has images and a Twitter feed, videos and links to features that tell the story of the cryptocurrency. It\u2019s very now. It\u2019s even got a slogan: \u201cOur future begins with you.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen a new bitcoin song, and we\u2019re not exactly sure what to make of this latest one we came across.

The video was taped in Manhattan, and has a number of recognizable locales for bitcoiners and non-bitcoiners alike. Look for the Bitcoin Center, the NYSE building, Central Park, Federal Hall, and a bunch of stores on Fifth Avenue. The bar is EVR, Charlie Shrem\u2019s midtown joint (that, yes, takes bitcoin).

Bitcoin Latest Price: $583.26, down 1.3% (via CoinDesk) - The public-comment period for Ben Lawsky\u2019s bitlicense proposal opened on Wednesday, and the initial comment from the bitcoin faithful seems to be: too much proposal, not enough time. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the sense that people are concerned about the extent of these regulations,\u201d Jim Harper, global policy counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, told MoneyBeat. \u201cIt\u2019s a really big thing the DFS has proposed to do here.\u201d The major sticking point for those opposed appears to be the degree to which the bitlicense will stifle innovation, he said. Many are arguing the requirements for obtaining one of the licenses will apparently be too onerous for small start-ups, codifying in effect only larger players. It could lead to a dynamic Mr. Harper said he\u2019s heard discussed: \u201cgeofencing,\u201d in effect start-ups would use filters to keep out any New York IP addresses. Mr. Lawsky has held, most recently in a reddit thread he started\xa0earlier this month, that \u201cwe have sought to strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity \u2013 without stifling beneficial innovation.\u201d A secondary concern for the opposition\xa0is that the DFS \u2013 with a 45-day comment period \u2013 is not giving the community enough time to digest the proposal and craft well-thought out criticisms. \u201cThere is an upwelling of resistance to the pace at which this is happening,\u201d said Mr. Harper, who argued in a blog post last week that he thought the community should have at least as long to respond as the DFS did to put the proposal together \u2013 about six months. The newly formed Chamber of Digital Commerce has also come out asking for an extension of the public-comment period. An online petition is being circulated asking the DFS for at least a 45-day extension past the public-comment period. \u201cWe believe an extension is necessary if stakeholders and interested parties are to have adequate opportunity to provide constructive feedback,\u201d state the petition, which gathered hundreds of signatures, including from well known names in the community like Barry Silbert, Jeremy Allaire, and Erik Voorhees. (Paul Vigna) -\xa0Ecuador has embraced cryptocurrencies, in a manner of speaking. The South American country\u2019s Congress approved by a wide majority a sweeping update of its financial laws, which includes\xa0two very interesting developments. First off, the law bars any institution other than the Ecuadorian Central Bank from issuing any form of currency, be it in physical or electronic form. \xa0Second, it authorizes the government to create its own \u201celectronic currency.\u201d \xa0President Rafael Correa must now sign the bill into law, but that seems like a formality as he was a driver of the bill in the first place. From our reading of the lengthy document, then, bitcoin and any other independent cryptocurrency appear now to be illegal in Ecuador while the government is clearing the way for what would be the world\u2019s first state-issued digital currency. There\u2019s clearly an agenda behind this that has as much to do with the left-wing populist President Correa\u2019s testy relationship with Washington as anything else. You see, thanks to Ecuador\u2019s history of financial dysfunction and the mistrust that its citizens developed in its former currency, the sucre, the oil-producing country was forced to adopt the U.S. dollar as its currency in 2000. \xa0An electronic alternative to dollar could give Ecuador an escape from its uncomfortable dependence on the greenback. Just as Greece\u2019s use of the euro exacerbated its economic fortunes during that country\u2019s recent crisis, so the dollar\u2019s dominance in Ecuador creates deflationary pressures and hurts Ecuadorian exporters. What\u2019s more, seeing his countrymen trade in paper money bearing the images of George Washington, Andrew Jackson and Benjamin Franklin must irk Mr. Correa to no end. A self-described socialist and a staunch ally of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his successor Nicolas Maduro, Mr. Correa frequently rails against Washington.\xa0(Michael Casey)', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/28/bitbeat-new-york-getting-tough-on-bitcoin-ecuador-getting-tougher/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 28, 14, 2), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: New York Getting Tough On Bitcoin; Ecuador Getting Tougher'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

Although Rep. Jared Polis (D., Colo.) is one of the more prominent bitcoin boosters in Congress, most other politicians accepting digital-currency-based donations hail from the ranks of small-government conservatives. \xa0That\u2019s evident from a new list of bitcoin-accepting candidates and groups added Thursday, one that includes a Republican gubernatorial candidate from New Hampshire and the libertarian-minded Republican Liberty Caucus. \xa0There are now more than 30 candidates, party organizations and PACs accepting bitcoin, according to a rough count that\u2019s partly based on data compiled by Make Your Laws, a non-partisan political action committee focused on campaign finance reform. It\u2019s perhaps no surprise that New Hampshire politicians in particular have warmed to bitcoin \xa0since the Federal Election Commission \xa0approved a specific request by Make Your Laws\xa0in May. \xa0With its motto of \u201clive free or die\u201d and a reputation for libertarian values of the kind shared by many bitcoiners, there\u2019s a natural fit. There, the charge is being led by 32-year-old Republican Andrew Hemingway, the youngest gubernatorial candidate in the country. Thursday he joined a dozen candidates for the state\u2019s Senate to incorporate onto their websites\xa0a platform from payment processor Paystand that provides an option to pay in credit card, e-check or bitcoin. \u201cI\u2019m the first millennial candidate for governor anywhere in the country, so I come at this from a distinct generational perspective,\u201d Mr. Hemingway said. \u201cI\u2019m also a tech entrepreneur. A lot of my friends and a lot of my regular network use bitcoins on a regular basis and have been active in the bitcoin community. So, it was a no-brainer to incorporate it into my campaign.\u201d Mr. Hemingway, a distant relative of author Ernest Hemingway, says he\u2019s more excited about blockchain technology \u2013 the software program and universal ledger through which bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network of computers manages and confirms transactions \u2013 than about bitcoin\u2019s role as a currency. \u201cIt would help with securing the vote, ending voter fraud,\u201d Mr. Hemingway said, citing a so-called \u201cBlockchain 2.0\u201d idea that foresees people casting having their votes independently verified via bitcoin\u2019s blockchain ledger. Blockchain 2.0 projects refer to innovations that aim to use that decentralized network for applications other than bitcoin payments. Separately, the Republican Libertarian Caucus, which supports national and state candidates with libertarian views, has agreed to work with Coinvox,\xa0a service that helps candidates to disclose donations in bitcoin. Discussing the RLC\u2019s move, National Chairman Matt Nye said bitcoin is \u201cjust a perfect fit for our core members,\u201d whom he described as \u201csmall \u2018L\u2019 libertarian Republican types.\u201d (Michael Casey) - Gasp!

This was surprising to a few folks, us included, seeing as adoption by major retailers has been one of the big signposts of mainstream acceptance. Even the Misesians over at CoinBrief contend that\xa0big news is the biggest mover of the price. \u201cThe most influential actions have large impacts on the bitcoin price, so the most important pieces of news are those that cover major players in the bitcoin community or cover breakthroughs\u2014or setbacks\u2014in mainstream adoption.\u201d But we\u2019ve noticed with quite a few of these kinds of stories this year \u2013 Dell, Expedia, Dish Networks \u2013 that the price actually hasn\u2019t responded to any of them. Why would that be? Part of it may be that there\u2019s a difference between retailers adopting bitcoin and consumers adopting bitcoin. It\u2019s good for Overstock and CheapAir that both have done more than $1 million in bitcoin business, but it seems that more people are still hoarding their bitcoins than spending them. \u201cWe need to see real transaction volume happen,\u201d Fred Wilson, a prominent bitcoin VC, said in a speech last week in the city. \u201cRight now, most people who get bitcoin hold it, they don\u2019t transact with it.\u201d We\u2019ve noticed over the past few months that hash rates have been rising.

But trading volume is low. That indicates there is increased activity somewhere,\xa0and if it\u2019s not turning into more spending in the general economy, then maybe Mr. Wilson\u2019s right; maybe people are hoarding it, in anticipation of higher prices down the road. If that\u2019s so, it\u2019s creating a sort of Catch 22. Hoarding precludes spending, but spending is the sign that bitcoin\u2019s becoming a more regular feature of people\u2019s daily lives, and that is what would really drive up the price.

The site launched in February under the name Coincove, and was a beta product until May. It is the creation of Hannah Kim and Tomas Melis, who met while students at Carnegie Mellon and recently came through the Boost VC accelerator program in Silicon Valley. Mr. Melis, who hails from Mexico, said he got the idea for Volabit from another endeavor of his, a \u201csocial startup\u201d that was working to install solar panels in poor Mexican neighborhoods. One of the biggest problems, he realized, was simply the payments, as many locals lacked access to banking. \u201cWhen I found out about bitcoin in 2011,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought this could have a big effect.\u201d Volabit is one of a burgeoning crop of bitcoin exchanges and money-processing services cropping up in emerging markets.

Several stores in Tokyo now accept bitcoin for a beer and fries, smartphone repairs and even eyelash extensions, as the reach of the virtual currency extends well beyond the tech nerd\u2019s basement or bedroom. Blockchain.info\u2019s app is a mobile bitcoin wallet application that will help users find a location for getting their hair cut and enable them to carry out the transaction using the virtual currency without risking a haircut to their bitcoin holdings in the meantime. The latest version of the app, released earlier this week, uses a map interface to give users information on stores accepting bitcoin. It also provides comments on stores from other users. These features will help to make bitcoin more convenient and \u201cless intimidating\u201d for potential users, according to Nicolas Cary, Blockchain.info\u2019s chief executive.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $619.72, down 0.3% (via CoinDesk) - Even before the public-comment period opens up for Benjamin Lawsky\u2018s bitlicense proposal, public comments are indeed being made. Over on reddit is where you\u2019ll find the most, ah, robust discussion. Mr. Lawsky, the superindent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, took to the famously freewheeling website to start a thread about his proposed bitlicense. \u201cHi, this is Ben Lawsky at NYDFS,\u201d\xa0he started off, simply enough. \u201cYou are creating a few dangerous barriers to entry and there is a huge glaring problem with the definition of virtual currency business activity,\u201d one writer said. It\u2019s one of the more even-tempered comments. \u201cStatists gonna state,\u201d on respondent wrote. \u201cIn what universe is that insanity reasonable?\u201d said another. \u201cBen Lawsky just killed New York as a center for financial crypto innovation,\u201d said a third, and our\xa0sampling of comments is severely limited by our own style guidelines, which prohibit offensive language. Suffice it to say, reddit has no language filters. The reddit responses generally fell into a couple of broad themes: Mr. Lawsky and the department were going to force bitcoin business overseas, Mr. Lawsky and the department were condemning themselves to obsolescence, or Mr. Lawsky and the department deserves credit for trying to honestly an intelligently craft a framework for integrating cryptocurrencies into the existing regulatory framework. As you might imagine, given the general disposition of the bitcoiners on reddit, that last was a minority opinion. When he started the thread, Mr. Lawsky said he\u2019d \u201ctry to stop by\u2026 and chime in from time to time.\u201d So far, it appears that he hasn\u2019t chimed in again. If you\u2019re interested in making a formal comment on the proposal as part of the state regulatory process, the open-comment period begins Wednesday.\xa0(Paul Vigna) - All that\u2019s to be expected. \u201cI think there are a number of people who are disappointed, and that\u2019s not entirely surprising,\u201d said Carol Van Cleef, a partner at the law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. Ms. Van Cleef, whose expertise is in payments systems, testified at the DFS\u2019s Janaury meeting on virtual currencies. But no matter how bitcoin\u2019s libertarian, crypto-anarchist wing reacts, the reality is that the bitlicense essentially codifies what\u2019s been emerging as best regulatory practices in the financial industry, and pulls cryptocurrency firms under that umbrella, she said.\xa0\u201cI think New York has done a good job thinking through the issues,\u201d she said. One problem with the proposed regulations, she pointed out, is that it puts smaller players at a disadvantage and put some pressure on innovation. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d she said, imagining a scenario might arise where larger players end up as incubators of sorts for smaller firms. Of course, startups could just chose to stay out of New York, block addresses from the Empire State and do their business elsewhere. But that comes with a trade-off, she noted. \u201cThe issue is that New York is one of the top markets in the U.S. New York\u2019s important, but it New York absolutely essential?\u201d That will be a choice businesses will make on their own. As for the comment period, she had some advice for critics of the proposal: \u201cThere needs to be constructive comments on specific issues,\u201d she said, and there has to be enough of them to reach a critical mass.

For bitcoin, it\u2019s one of the biggest signs yet of mainstream acceptance. With nearly $57 billion in sales in 2013, Dell would be by far the largest company to take bitcoin. Dish Network, which began accepting bitcoin in May, had $13.9 billion in 2013 sales. Expedia, which in June began accepting the cryptocurrency for hotel bookings, had $4.8 billion in 2013 sales. Overstock, which started taking bitcoin in January, had $1.3 billion in 2013 sales. Coinbase, one of the major bitcoin payments processors, landed the business. Customers who chose bitcoin as their payment method when on Dell\u2019s website will be sent over to Coinbase\u2019s site to complete the purchase, a fairly common procedure. Coinbase reached out to Dell a few months ago, according to Adam White, the director of business development and strategy at the company, who worked with Dell on the partnership. \u201cWe had some good conversations with them,\u201d he said, and they left it at that. Two weeks ago, Dell got back in touch with Mr. White, and said they\u2019d decided to adopt bitcoin, and wanted to get it done quickly so as to capture sales during the back-to-school season.

Coinbase has about 35,000 merchants using its processing services, and estimates of the total number of merchants using bitcoin is roughly 65,000. Dell is the by far the biggest company, though, in that group. For Dell, the goal was to find another way to reach customers, according to David Frink. The decision involved a combination of people within the company, he said, including Mr. Dell himself, who was \u201cvery interested in moving this along quickly.\u201d That said, the company understands bitcoin is still in an early stage, and isn\u2019t expecting too much from this. \u201cThis is a pilot, and we\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d Mr. Frink said. Of Dell\u2019s $57 billion in 2013 sales, $44.7 billion came from hardware, with the rest from the company\u2019s services unit.

A group of Czech individuals with broadcast and media backgrounds Thursday unveiled Czech Crown Coin, or CZC, a digital, cryptocurrency akin to globally known Bitcoin, with the goal of supporting Internet businesses in the Czech Republic. Ladislav Faith, who is leading the project and by day is a television cameraman based in Prague, said the goal is to create a Czech alternative to both cash transactions and to other global virtual currencies. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Czech [language] support and above all we\u2019ve reserved the currency for Czech citizens,\u201d Mr. Faith said. Fifty percent of the total virtual currency allocation of 100 million coins will be reserved for Czechs and the coins will be allocated according to a registration system and will later be traded on international virtual currency exchanges. The remainder of the coins will be released afterwards and will be available to any interested parties. \u201cThe second half will be owned by the entire world and mainly by people from countries where such systems are popular, such as the United States,\u201d Mr. Faith said. Virtual currencies have been around for several years but have gained in popularity as of late. The technology enables tax-free transactions across jurisdictions. The Czech Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to requests for comment whether the virtual coin will encourage tax evasion. The system is based on litecoin, a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open source software project that enables transactions among users and is not controlled by any central authority. Czech Crown Coin was inspired by auroracoin, a similar systems now being rolled out in Iceland, Mr. Faith said. Related virtual currencies are already in place in Spain and Poland, he added. The coins will be made available to users in three phases starting in September. The project quickly found skepticism from the public, with people in online chatrooms saying the project is too local and won\u2019t garner critical mass or that it faces risks from hackers. Mr. Faith said that the project\u2019s server capacity is sufficient but that if there\u2019s a need for additional capacity, they won\u2019t hesitate. He confirmed the risk of hacking but said it was under control. \u201cToday we experienced several hackers\u2019 attacks; two from Russia, several from the Czech Republic and other countries, but we were able to stave them off and to further increase our security,\u201d Mr. Faith said. Virtual currencies operate in a grey area in legal terms, with central banks and governments each applying their own definitions to such systems. Such currencies face security, price volatility, and other challenges that could ultimately prevent widespread adoption. The Czech central bank said virtual currencies in fact aren\u2019t currencies at all and that they present risks to consumers as they are not backed by any institutions. However such electronic barter systems do not break any laws\xa0so long as they remain in the digital realm without issuance of any physical coins, banknotes or tokens. The central bank said the name of the virtual currency resembles the English translation of \u010cesk\xe1 koruna, the official Czech currency, and therefore was \u201cunfortunate and misleading.\u201d Write to Sean Carney at sean.carney@wsj.com', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Sean Carney', 'email': 'Sean Carney'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/18/new-czech-virtual-currency-launched/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 18, 5, 10), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Czech Republic Gets Its Own Virtual Currency'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

Seven months after holding a clutch of highly publicized meetings on cryptocurrency regulations, Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, released the draft version of the agency\u2019s\xa0proposed rules for regulating virtual currencies. The draft rules, which runs a relatively brief 40 pages, seek to put a regulatory framework around companies seeking to operate within the state of New York in the field of digital currencies. Given the stature of the state in the financial world, the rules are being closely watched both for the implications to any firm wanting to operate in the state and\xa0as a possible precursor for other jurisdictions. The rules will be published in the state register on July 23, which will kick off a 45-day public comment period. \u201cWe have sought to strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity \u2013 without stifling beneficial innovation,\u201d Mr. Lawsky said in a press release. \u201cSetting up common sense rules of the road is vital to the long-term future of the virtual currency industry, as well as the safety and soundness of customer assets.\u201d Assuming the draft rules are adopted as regulation, any business offering virtual-currency services would be required to file an application for a license to do business in the state \u2013 Mr. Lawsky himself coined it a \u201cbitlicense\u201d in those January hearings \u2013 that would require it to maintain certain minimum levels of capital and bookkeeping, as well as adhere to anti-fraud and anti-money laundering rules and cyber security programs. Firms would also be subject to an examination from the DFS at least once every two years. Mr. Lawsky emerged as one of the more open-minded regulators when it comes to digital currencies, as he\u2019s sought to take a lead role in determining just how much regulation is need to maintain a balance between customer protection and industry innovation, a theme he struck back in January. Those meetings included testimony from the litecoin creator Charles Lee, SecondMarket\u2019s Barry Silbert, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, and the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, who are working to get a bitcoin ETF approved. At the time, Mr. Lawsky suggested that bitcoin would have to come under a regulatory umbrella, and that just \u201ctweaking around the edges\u201d would not be sufficient. \u201cWe are pleased that Superintendent Lawsky and the Department of Financial Services have embraced bitcoin and digital assets and created a regulatory framework that protects consumers,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss said via email. \u201cWe look forward to New York State becoming the hub of this exciting new technology.\u201d The new rules are not likely to go down well with bitcoin\u2019s anti-establishment, crypto-anarchist wing, given that the entire appeal of the virtual currency in its infancy was precisely the fact that it was outside of traditional money and regulatory systems (a sampling of the reactions can been seen on this reddit stream that Lawsky himself started). That wing has seen itself increasingly marginalized as bitcoin becomes more mainstream and the currency becomes \u2013 relatively speaking \u2013 more stable. At the time of the January hearings, bitcoin prices had been wildly erratic. They were trading around $800, after having run up above $1,100 in December.

In late 2013, the brothers were accepted into and went through the Y Combinator program, a Silicon Valley \u201caccelerator\u201d that puts startups through a three-month boot camp of sorts for building businesses. \u201cWe see [the potential for] many assets traded over the blockchain,\u201d Mr. Schvey said; not just currencies, but securities and contracts and such. \u201cWe continue to want to be the place people go to analyze that.\u201d That dovetails with Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s views on the subject, according to general partner Balaji Srinivasan. He described a sort of \u201cWall Street 2.0\u201d where all manner of securities and assets are traded over cryptocurrency plumbing; these are the kinds of products that are often referred to as \u201csmart contracts\u201d that would be embedded in bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.

Soylent also is not a nutritional supplement. Soylent is an actual food product and the company that makes it, a California startup, is now accepting bitcoin. Soylent started off as an experiment in healthy eating by founder Rob Rhinehart. He wrote on his blog about this powdered drink he\u2019d created, that combined all the essential ingredients of food. The post went viral, and he found himself flooded with people interested in his drink. So he did what any entrepreneurial minded Millennial would do: He started a crowdfunding drive. He named his concoction \u201cSoylent,\u201d a self-consciously ironic reference to the 1973 sci-fi movie \u201cSoylent Green,\u201d a dystopian tale of a world gone wrong in which the beleaguered population is fed a product called Soylent Green \u2013 which, Charlton Heston discovers, is made of ground-up human beings. This real-world Soylent \u201cis not made of humans,\u201d Anastassia Laskey, the company\u2019s vice president of marketing, said with a laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s no soy in it, either.\u201d It\u2019s not a nutritional supplement, either, she said. It\u2019s been approved by the FDA as a food (if you\u2019re interested to know what\u2019s in it, everything is on the company\u2019s website). Soylent is a classic example of a collaborative-economy enterprise, and from the beginning, its customers have been asking for a way to buy it using bitcoins. The company took its product onto the online marketplace Shopify in May, and was immediately looking for a way to integrate bitcoin into its payments options. That became feasible with Shopify\u2019s new agreement with CoinBase for processing bitcoin transactions. Selling a product that\u2019s named after a fictional product that\u2019s made out of people has been a challenge for Ms. Laskey, but the name has some benefits, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation-starter.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - We mentioned yesterday the auction of bitcoins.com, the domain name owned by the bankrupt Mt.

In Jersey, they\u2019ve got a whole crypto chamber of commerce going, and last week, the island announced the launch of\xa0a bitcoin hedge fund domiciled on the island. Now, Man is striking back. A new startup called Crypto Next has launched from a quay in Man. The firm is building what it describes as a turn-key product for merchants to \xa0accept bitcoin payments, including bank accounts and white-label currency exchange platforms. The fact that the system is located in Man means that it\u2019s subject to Man\u2019s regulations, which may be a sight more amiable to cryptocurrencies than other locales. As part of its launch, Crypto Next is issuing 5 million Crypto Next coins through a crowd sale on its website, which began today. They\u2019ve sold about 1% of them so far.

(Paul Vigna) - The price of bitcoin is naturally a useful tool in assessing bitcoin\u2019s value. That said, it may not necessarily be the best way to measure bitcoin\u2019s value as more than just a currency. Pantera Capital, the San Francisco VC shop, has developed an internal index, the BitIndex, that comprises developer interest, merchant adoption, the hashrate, Google searches and a few other metrics, which it expects will present a fuller, and less volatile, measure of the world of bitcoin. \u201cVisibility usually means media coverage, public awareness, and, in the case of bitcoin, price and regulation,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cHowever, bitcoin\u2019s long-term success is more tied to growth in adoption and to development of applications which encourage both merchants and consumers to want to use bitcoins.\u201d Here\u2019s a chart of the index since the start of 2012.

Gox planning to auction off the domain name bitcoins.com, and hoping to raise nearly $750,000, it appears the sale is sparking some interest in similar bitcoin-related domains. Bloomberg\u2019s Olga Kharif writes that prices have tripled since last year for domains that reference digital currencies like bitcoin. BitcoinWallet.com sold in January for $250,000 \u2013 23 times what Niko Younts paid for it when he bought it only one month earlier. The company that holds BTC.com is looking for more than $1 million for that name. The one domain name that wasn\u2019t mentioned, though, was bitcoin.com, the history of which we traced back in April. That name sold for more than $1 million way back in 2011, and has gotten only more valuable since then (the owner remains anonymous; Blockchain.info currently leases it for an undisclosed amount).

If successful, this new currency could exploit bitcoin\u2019s inexpensive and direct payments network, while avoiding its volatility. The startup, Realcoin, is set to announce that its digital currency, dubbed realcoins, will be backed one-to-one by a fully auditable reserve of dollars. The bearer of these realcoins will have the right to redeem them for U.S. currency. That should make realcoin much more stable than bitcoin, which saw an 86-fold increase over the first 11 months of last year only to succumb to a 70% decline in the following four months. Such volatility has detracted from bitcoin\u2019s appeal as a payments mechanism. Founded by Brock Pierce, a former Disney child actor who is now a prolific bitcoin investor, along with ad industry entrepreneur Reeve Collins and software engineer Craig Sellars, Realcoin is the latest in a wave of so-called Bitcoin 2.0 ventures, which use bitcoin\u2019s computer infrastructure to exchange property and execute contracts without third-party intermediaries. These projects open up bitcoin\u2019s decentralized, peer-to-peer network to a variety of commercial uses beyond just transactions denominated in bitcoins. \u201cUnfortunately, there has been confusion for people between the currency called bitcoin and the technology called bitcoin, when they are distinctly different things,\u201d said Mr. Collins, Realcoin\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. In effect \u201cwe are digitizing the dollar and giving that digital dollar access to the bitcoin blockchain.\u201d The blockchain is a publicly shared ledger of transactions maintained by a decentralized network of computer owners known as miners, whose machines keep it updated in return for periodic rewards in bitcoin. The system was initially designed to protect the integrity of the currency, ensuring bitcoins couldn\u2019t be double-spent, or counterfeited, thus obviating the need for transactions to pass through banks and other trusted third-party intermediaries. A few years after bitcoin\u2019s 2009 launch, however, Bitcoin 2.0 developers are creating programs that used the blockchain\u2019s method of validating transactions for different legal arrangements. Thus digitized property could be exchanged, commercial deals could be struck and contracts could be executed, all without engaging fee-charging middlemen. Realcoin will use a Bitcoin 2.0 software protocol known as Mastercoin, which takes digitized information about particular assets or contracts and embeds it into bitcoin transactions. In this case, that data will define the rights attached to realcoins. Realcoin founder Mr. Sellars is the chief technology officer of the Mastercoin Foundation. To ensure realcoins retain their value at one dollar, the firm will maintain a real-time record of its dollar-based reserves, all held in conservative investments, and will subject that record to the blockchain\u2019s authenticating system, Mr. Collins said. Realcoins will be introduced or removed from circulation depending on whether dollars are being added or redeemed. Mr. Collins said Realcoin has signed with a major banking partner and is seeking deals with other banks, digital-currency exchanges and ATM providers to become \u201cgateways\u201d for buying, trading or redeeming realcoins around the world. In creating a global network for people to cheaply and quickly exchange claims on the world\u2019s main reserve currency, it could boost worldwide demand for dollars, he says. Mr. Collins said Realcoin\u2019s lawyers are working to obtain U.S. money transmitter licenses from those states that require them and that it also plans to issue digital currencies backed by euros and yen. It\u2019s unclear how realcoin will be received in countries with capital controls such as China and Argentina, whose citizens could use it to circumvent limits on foreign currency. Realcoin might also attract scorn from bitcoin\u2019s libertarian supporters, who see the independent digital currency as a successor to, not a facilitator of, government-controlled currencies. Asked about such a reaction, Realcoin founder Mr. Pierce said, \u201cI\u2019m not selling any of my bitcoins.

Gox has paid $188,763 to Tibanne, its parent company, as a part of its liquidation. A heavily blacked-out application to make the payments, which was submitted by a court-appointed trustee for Mt. Gox, was revealed on a website called goxdox.com. Two people familiar with the matter have confirmed the authenticity of the document filed with the Tokyo District Court in May. While the purpose of the transaction was redacted, the people close to the matter say the money was for office rent, employee payrolls and Internet server fees. In Japan, it is common for a company that is being liquidated to make these types of payments as firms that are being broken up are required to try to pay off their outstanding debts and obligations before distributing leftover assets to creditors. The goxdox.com document shows that the trustee asked the court for permission to make the payment, saying it is \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cappropriate.\u201d \u201cThis transaction won\u2019t disadvantage creditors in an unreasonable manner,\u201d trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi said in the document. Mr. Kobayashi was not available for comment. Even though liquidation in Japan typically means creditors receive almost none of the money that they initially put up, many of the exchange\u2019s 127,000 creditors are upset by the payment, with their anger focused on Mt. Gox chief Mark Karpeles. Mr. Karpeles is the head of both Tibanne and the exchange. All of the workers servicing the exchange were Tibanne employees, and the two companies shared the same rental office in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya district. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why the court is approving Mt. Gox\u2019s payment to Tibanne,\u201d said Yoshimitsu Homma, a Mt. Gox creditor and president of Japan Digital Money Association. The application, issued on May 23, showed the exchange has $7.5 million in cash. It is not clear whether that amount was before or after the payment to Tibanne, which was invoiced on May 15. The exchange, when it collapsed in February, had $38 million in assets, including $5 million in cash. The Tokyo-based exchanged filed for bankruptcy in February, saying 850,000 bitcoins, worth half a billion dollars, were stolen. It later claimed to have discovered 200,000 bitcoins, but most of the still-missing 650,000 bitcoins belong to creditors. Mt. Gox\u2019s creditors are focused on how the trustee plans to distribute the 200,000 recovered bitcoins. While some of them hope these bitcoins will be returned to them in the form of bitcoins, it is unclear whether Japanese law will allow it. They are also concerned about a possible sharp fall in the bitcoin market if the trustee turns all of the bitcoins into cash. The exchange will hold its first meeting with its creditors on July 23, but it is not clear whether Mr. Karlepes will attend the gathering. Mr. Karpeles is selling assets of Tibanne, including the possibly high-value domain name bitcoins.com.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $637.59, down 1.5% (via CoinDesk) - A scam artist tried to swindle a group of potential bidders in the June auction of 30,000 bitcoins by the U.S. Marshals Service, and appears to have scored a small win with at least one of them. In mid-June, the Marshals Service accidentally sent a reply-all email to a group of potential bidders for the bitcoins, part of the Silk Road bust. That email was leaked to the press around June 18. A few days later, the scammer started sending a phishing scheme to people on the list. Several people who were on the Marshals\u2019 list confirmed to MoneyBeat that they received the phishing email, and several \u2013 including Pantera Capital and Bitcoin Shop -\xa0also said they did not receive the email. One recipient reportedly fell for it. This is what happened: Around June 21, several people on the list got an email from somebody calling herself Linda Jackson, who claimed to be from a group called BitFilm Production. Here is the body of the initial email, sent to us by one of the people who received it: I work for BitFilm Production. We are currently putting together some media for a client regarding the Silk Road seized coin auction by the USMS.

This media will have strong syndication, and you could have the possibility of being quoted publicly (you can also be an anonymous source if you so wish). Thanks for your time, Linda Jackson Anybody who responded was then sent another email, with what appeared to be a Google Doc list of questions. But clicking on the attachment unleashed a malacious attack that seized access to the user\u2019s email account and passwords. Neither the Marshals Service, nor BitFilm Production, a German media company, were aware of the scam at the time we contacted them. \u201cI can assure you that no one from BitFilm has contacted participants in the bitcoin auction,\u201d BitFilm managing director Aaron Koenig said, via email. The Marshals released this statement: \u201cThe Marshals never released the email addresses publicly, but only to individuals who requested \u2018frequently asked questions\u2019 about the bitcoin auction. It appears one or more of the FAQ recipients made the list of email addresses available to the media and general public. \u201cWe encourage anyone believed to be a victim of a phishing scam to contact the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The FBI is the investigative agency for phishing scams in the United States. Go to www.ic3.gov/default.aspx for additional guidance.\u201d At least one recipient apparently fell for the scam. Bitcoin Reserve, an Australian bitcoin arbitrage fund, lost 100 bitcoins after co-founder Sam Lee did click on the fake Google Doc. That opened up his email to the attacker, who used it to send further emails to employees within the firm, purporting to be him and directing them to send 100 bitcoins to a specific address. Before they realized it was a scam, they\u2019d transferred the bitcoins. Mr. Lee did not reply to a request for comment, although in the report, he took responsibility for falling for the scam, rather than trying to lay it at Marshals\u2019 feet.

Overstock was one of the first big retailers to start taking bitcoin, and while there have been others, notably Expedia and 1-800-Flowers most recently, there is still a chicken and egg problem with cryptocurrency adoption (outside of the early adopters): which comes first, the retailer, or the customer? Will retailers want to adopt a payments system that few or none of its customers use? Will customers use a payment system that few or none of their retailers accept? This is where Mr. Byrne sees a role for Overstock. Byrne told us back in June he believes Overstock can play a \u201ccatalytic role\u201d in promoting bitcoin, via its vendors strung across 80 countries. Of that supplier group, many are small, low-income entrepreneurs who contribute to Worldstock, Overstock\u2019s offshoot site for artisanal \u201cfair trade\u201d products from 54 different countries\u2014a group hungry for a fairer financial system than the one the outdated, costly payments model that they are currently beholden to. \u201cMy commitment is to the crypto-revolution,\u201d Mr. Byrne said on the podcast. (Paul Vigna/Michael Casey) - Lamassu, one of the big ATM makers in the bitcoin space, is releasing a new version of its open-source software this week, one designed to make it easier for vendors to customize the machines for whatever service they care to offer. The new software is called \u201cRakia,\u201d which is Hebrew for \u201cskies\u201d or \u201cfirmament,\u201d and it will allow Lamassu\u2019s machines to interact much easier with outside services and makes them like little portals into the cryptocurrency space, according to Lamassu co-founder Zach Harvey. Vendors can customize the machines, they can tie them into specific wallets or wallet services, they can adjust the commissions on transactions. They can provide remittance services or even bill-paying services. In essence, each ATM becomes its own decentralized server. Lamassu won\u2019t have any access to them. \u201cThe basic idea is to open up the options for our systems, to make them more powerful and useful,\u201d Mr. Harvey said. While in terms of the wider world, bitcoin ATMs are still rare, there are more and more of them being installed, and the competition between Lamassu, Robocoin, and a host of others has become heated.

Mr. Draper was not immediately available for comment. Avish Bhama, CEO of Vaurum, confirmed the news via email but did not disclose details of Mr. Draper\u2019s bid. Assuming he bid in the range of the $580 market price for bitcoin on the day of the auction, last Friday, the bid would\u2019ve been for roughly $17 million. But it\u2019s possible, even likely, that he bid higher. The identity of the winner has been a source of keen interest all week, since the auction closed on Friday. The Marshals Service started notifying the bidders on Monday of the results. High profile bidders like Barry Silbert of SecondMarket and Pantera Capital confirmed that they did not win. Bitcoin Shop, another bidder, also confirmed it didn\u2019t win. Other bidders, like Coinbase and the Winklevoss Twins, declined to comment. On Tuesday, the Marshals announced that there was one winning bidder. It declined to name the winner. Mr. Draper was part of a group that included Battery Ventures and former AOL chief executive Steve Case that invested $4 million in Vaurum in May. The company went through the VC accelerator program Boost VC, run by Mr. Draper\u2019s son, Adam Draper. Mr. Draper won the auction independently, Mr. Bhama said. He is not only an investor, he is a customer of Vaurum as well, which is where the coins will be held. \u201cOur partnership will allow us to use the coins to provide liquidity to our exchanges in emerging markets,\u201d Mr. Bhama said. Vaurum explained how the partnership came about in its post: \u201cVaurum was incubated\xa0by\xa0Boost\xa0last\xa0summer which is where we met Adam Draper and Tim Draper, who are both early investors in us. Collectively, we\u2019ve been brainstorming to come up with new ways to help grow global bitcoin adoption, and what we came up with is a way to leverage our exchanges and utilize the auctioned pool of bitcoins, as well as market making strategies, to help provide liquidity in these underserved markets.\u201d Since trading around $580 on Friday, bitcoins prices have been rising, trading on Wednesday at $642, according to CoinDesk, as the market anticipated a strong spate of bids, showing demand from venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and investors alike. The coins auctioned off came from servers maintained by Silk Road, a notorious online drug marketplace that utilized bitcoin as its payment system, which the feds busted in October. The Marshals are still holding onto another 110,000 bitcoins that were maintained on the personal computer of Ross Ulbricht, the site\u2019s alleged mastermind, who was arrested and is awaiting trial. - Robin Sidel contributed to this post.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/02/vc-tim-draper-is-sole-winner-of-u-s-bitcoin-auction/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 2, 9, 20), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Tim Draper Is Sole Winner of U.S. Bitcoin Auction'}, {'articleText': u' Coinbase, one of the big bitcoin-services companies, has unveiled a new type of account for storing bitcoins, \u201cthe vault.\u201d The new account, which the company describes on its blog, now allows\xa0users to have two different kinds of accounts: a \u201cwallet\u201d for day-to-day spending, and a \u201cvault\u201d for long-term storage of their wealth. The vault features a raft of security measures that protect a user\u2019s money, and also makes moving money out of the account a slower, more deliberate process. It will initially be rolled out to a small number of randomly selected users, with plans to offer it to all the company\u2019s customers over the next two weeks. \u201cWe do know there\u2019s a lot of interest in the bitcoin community in vault products,\u201d\xa0Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told MoneyBeat. \xa0\u201cOur customers have been asking for something like this for a year.\u201d The new measures help address one of the persistent criticisms of the entire bitcoin experience: relatively lax security around wallets, the nickname for the online accounts used to store bitcoins. Anybody who lost their money in the Mt. Gox debacle can attest to that. In many cases, all a scammer needs is to trick a user into revealing their \u201cprivate key\u201d to gain access to their wallet. This happens more often than you might think. There have been several responses to this. One is a move toward what\u2019s called \u201cmulti-sig\u201d security, in which more than one person must sign off on a transaction from an account. An even more extreme measure is called a \u201ccold\u201d wallet, like the one offered by startup Piper, in which the private key isn\u2019t stored online at all; it\u2019s held only on a printed piece of paper. Coinbase\u2019s vault is another option along these lines. The new account allows for multi-sig technology and offline storage, and also adds in time-delayed withdrawals, in which users can add a 48-hour delay to any transactions during which time the company will contact the account holder directly to confirm the transaction. The growth in customers accounts, for both Coinbase and competitor Blockchain, continues to grow at a pretty torrid rate. Mr. Armstrong said the company is seeing growth in its user base of about 3-4% a week, and has jumped from 100,000 accounts a year ago to about 1.4 million now. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty wild ride here,\u201d he said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/02/coinbase-adds-new-type-of-bitcoin-account-the-vault/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 2, 9, 4), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Coinbase Adds New Type of Bitcoin Account, &lsquo;The Vault&rsquo;'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

(Paul Vigna) - As the Winklevoss twins\u2019 bitcoin ETF moves regulatory approval process, the duo filed an updated Form S-1 statement with the SEC on Tuesday (the form used to register securities).\xa0This is the fourth amendment to the form, and the most prominent thing to come out of it is that they\u2019ve picked a ticker symbol. Shares in the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will be registered under the symbol COIN (we were surprised to learn that nobody had it, but nobody did), according to the amendment, which is dated July 1 (a year to the day of the initial filing, incidentally). They will trade on the Nasdaq OMX, as announced back in May. Most of the other changes comprise minor tweaks. In a section talking about government regulations, they add Switzerland as a government that\u2019s moving toward clearer regulations, and note Bolivia\u2019s central bank banned bitcoin. There are a few additions to the risk factors. One notes that since the core bitcoin developers aren\u2019t paid for their work (in general), they could, possibly, stop maintaining the protocol. In a section describing the danger of a 51% attack, they add a discussion of the recent news that GHash.io recently touched the 50% mark. The ETF is still winding its way through the SEC\u2019s approval process. \u201cUnder the securities laws we are not permitted to discuss timing to launch or effectiveness,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss said. \u201cHowever, identifying the ticker symbol and the exchange are two major events that further demonstrate that we are moving forward as expected.\u201d (Paul Vigna) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/01/bitbeat-only-one-winner-in-marshals-service-bitcoin-auction/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 1, 17, 11), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: Only One Winner in Marshals Service Bitcoin Auction'}, {'articleText': u' The Chicago Sun-Times is trying something to breathe a little life into the beleaguered world of physical newspapers (a subject about which we are intimately concerned), and it involves bitcoin and Beyonce.

The FCA hopes to develop the rules around disruptive payment technologies, so that financial institutions who are disrupting, and those that are being disrupted, can operate within the same legal framework. The FCA also wants to establish London as a center of financial technology innovation. While other payment innovations like mobile and peer-to-peer payments were mentioned in the FCA initiative, a driving motivator is to have some sort of legal guidance for bitcoin. But while the FCA deliberates, a young London lawyer is already advising about a dozen bitcoin businesses in the U.K. and Europe in a field where rules and regulations are still being drawn up, and where most governments, banks, and institutional investors are still trying to get their heads around what bitcoin is \u2013 and what it means for their businesses. Meet Eitan Jankelewitz, Britain\u2019s Bitcoin Barrister. The 33 year old Jankelewitz, a lawyer in the Technology Practice at London-based Sheridan\u2019s, a law firm specializing in media and entertainment, is considered by some in the U.K. bitcoin community to be an authority on the rapidly shifting cryptocurrency market. As part of a London bitcoin delegation, he met this year with HMRC to advise the tax collector on the properties of bitcoin. His firm is one of only a small handful of law firms in the U.K. that represent bitcoin businesses and accept payment in bitcoin. It was the first to do so, and it was Mr. Jankelewitz that first brought bitcoin business into the firm. Mr. Jankelewitz recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal about bitcoin regulation and his bitcoin customers. Edited excerpts: WSJ: Isn\u2019t it risky for your law firm to represent bitcoin clients and accept payment in bitcoin? That market is notoriously volatile. Mr. Jankelewtiz: At the moment it\u2019s just jobs here and there. Most of them are startups. By definition, how long can you have been in business if you\u2019re in the bitcoin business? But it\u2019s good for the law firm because it opens a new stream of clients and doesn\u2019t leave it too exposed to the volatility of the bitcoin market. WSJ: What kinds of bitcoin businesses does your firm represent? Mr. Jankelewtiz: We have clients who are pure bitcoin businesses and don\u2019t even have a bank account. We have people making the bitcoin mining hardware, people offering the mining hardware as a service [what's known as cloud mining], we have people making the wallets, insured wallet storage, and super cold storage [offline, printed bitcoin data kept behind lock and key]; we\u2019ve got exchanges, a traditional bitcoin exchange, an alt-coin [alternative cryptocurrencies] exchange doing 100 different alts, a peer-to-peer exchange; we\u2019ve got video game companies selling video game bundles for bitcoin, and pureplay ecommerce platforms selling stuff for bitcoin. We have the full range. WSJ: What kinds of services do bitcoin businesses need? Mr. Jankelewtiz: If someone\u2019s got a bitcoin wallet app, they need terms and conditions to get onto the app stores. Customers need to know the terms, and businesses need to be protected in case someone sues them because a customer has deleted their wallet.\xa0 If it\u2019s an exchange then they need to have terms to regulate how bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is traded. WSJ: What are the major hurdles for bitcoin now? Mr. Jankelewitz: Access to banking. Crypto-anarchists may tell you that this is going to destroy 400 years of banking, I don\u2019t agree at all. I don\u2019t think that banks are reluctant to provide services to bitcoin businesses because they feel like it\u2019s a threat, that they\u2019re empowering a potential competitor. The reason banks don\u2019t want to provide bank accounts to bitcoin businesses is because it\u2019s an unknown quantity, and the regulatory situation is not settled. They don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to get fined \u2013 which has been happening recently \u2013 for non-compliance of money-laundering regulation. The banks don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on all of the time because the regulators aren\u2019t doing anything a lot of the time. \xa0You got a situation where a bitcoin business goes to a bank to open a bank account, and the bank tells the business to go to the regulator. The bitcoin business then goes to the regulator and asks it to create some regulation for bitcoin. The regulator says to the bitcoin company: when you have a business then we\u2019ll regulate you, otherwise we could be regulating nothing. It\u2019s a horrible circle where they can\u2019t get a bank account because they don\u2019t have a business, the bank won\u2019t give it to them because there\u2019s no regulation, and the regulator won\u2019t regulate because there\u2019s no business to regulate. WSJ: What\u2019s the tax situation for bitcoin? Mr. Jankelewitz: HMRC last year said bitcoin would be subject to VAT like a single-purpose voucher, which meant that when you buy a bitcoin there\u2019s VAT attached to it. So if you buy a bitcoin for ten pounds, it will actually cost you 12. But then when you spend bitcoin on a product, there\u2019s VAT on the product. So you\u2019re paying VAT twice. If I want to buy euros I don\u2019t have to pay VAT on the exchange. I also don\u2019t pay VAT on the exchange services. HMRC\u2019s statement was just factually wrong because bitcoin is not a single-purpose voucher, it has no issuer, and it has more than one purpose. HMRC agreed to unsay that statement, which was an improvement. And then in February-March of this year HMRC presented us with a full tax treatment for bitcoin. It\u2019s a really good and sensible approach. Now in the UK the law is you know exactly how to pay your taxes in bitcoin, and if you are a bitcoin-only business you have to file your accounts in bitcoin because that\u2019s your functional currency. You can\u2019t pay your taxes in bitcoin. You have to work out how much you owe in bitcoin and then convert it to Sterling at whatever time. WSJ: Where do you see things going for bitcoin? Mr. Jankelewitz:\xa0What I\u2019d love to see is bitcoin become mainstream, not something whacky and unusual. Allow it to interface with the existing financial systems and let it do its thing. People can use it as they use any other currency. Just because it\u2019s not legal tender of a particular nation state doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not money. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0", 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Amir Mizroch', 'email': 'Amir Mizroch'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/01/meet-britains-bitcoin-barrister/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 7, 1, 5, 40), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Meet Britain&rsquo;s Bitcoin Barrister'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $638.25, up 6.6% (via CoinDesk) - The U.S. Marshals Service will start contacting the winning bidders in its\xa0auction of seized Silk-Road bitcoins\xa0at 5 p.m. New York time. The question is, how are the rest of us supposed to find out who won? The answers matter, for several reasons. For one thing, the Marshals Service is auctioning off 29,000 bitcoins, part of the assets seized in the October 2013 Silk Road bust and arrest of Ross Ulbricht (the coins being auctioned were held on Silk Road servers; the Marshals still hold another 110,000 coins that were on Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s computer). That\u2019s a big chunk of digital change to drop on the market. For another thing, the outcome will show where some pretty sophisticated, big investors really value bitcoin. Then there\u2019s the impression that, by auctioning off the bitcoins rather than just deleting the account, the feds are implicitly acknowledging the cryptocurrency has real value. Lastly, it involves the Silk Road. For curiosity\u2019s sake alone it\u2019s interesting. We already got one result: the group put together by Barry Silbert was outbid on all its offers, a surprise that may speak to strong demand.\xa0The Marshals will not provide details of the winning bids \u2013 meaning it will be up to the bidders to make any announcements. Bitcoin prices seemed to be rising in response to \xa0that news, up 6.6% at last count, and the prices fetched at the auction could have a strong effect. If the feds just dumped their holdings on the market, for instance, it would certainly drive the price down. But doing it this way, with sealed bids, creates a different dynamic. With bitcoin trading strongly on Monday, well above the roughly $570 range on Friday (the deadline for bids), it appears the market is betting that the winning bids are above-market prices. Still, it\u2019s not clear that\u2019s the case, and we may not know for some time, if at all, since it\u2019s up to the bidders. Barry Silbert found out early that the syndicate he put together was outbid on all its offers, he announced via Twitter. That could speak to stronger than expected bidding. Jeremy Allaire from Circle told the Journal earlier today that the auction was \u201ca market opportunity to potentially acquire large blocks at a discount.\u201d That seemed to indicate he expected low prices. Some of the bidders may have underestimated the demand. Other bidders included Coinbase\u2019s Fred Ehrsam (who will not disclose how his bids pan out), Pantera Capital, hedge-fund manager David Goel of Matrix Capital, and Luther Lowe, who\u2019s the director of public policy at Yelp. Mr. Silbert said he didn\u2019t see the rationale for anybody announcing whether or not they won. We\u2019ll be canvassing the crowd best we can for details. If you\u2019re interesting in attempting to track it yourself, start\xa0here. That\u2019s the page on Blockchain.info that shows the Marshals\u2019 wallets; they are the two at the bottom, with 44,000 and 100,000 bitcoins, respectively. All those other transactions are from people sending bitcoins to the Marshals, mainly because one of blockchain\u2019s features is the public message; in essense, these are pranksters who are taking advantage of a high-profile wallet to send a message. Any message. \u201cBroke student here,\u201d reads one. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to eat for the next three days. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\u201d\xa0(Paul Vigna) - One pitch we received just could not be passed up: Mantry, a Food-of-the-month club tailored for, well, for Man, announced that it will start taking bitcoin.

The price for a bitcoin on Friday when the bidding\xa0occurred\xa0was around $570. The price of bitcoin this morning is close to $630, according to blockchain.info\u2014a main bitcoin transaction database. The bidding, by major hedge funds, law firms, bitcoin businesses, and others, occurred last Friday. Results are expected Monday. While no formal announcement is expected by the US Marshall\u2019s service, a number of the auction participants will most likely announce they have won bids and at what price. According to blockchain.info, the market value of 30,000 bitcoin is $18.8 million. According to the blockchain, there are now almost 13 million bitcoins in circulation, just over half of the total number that will ever be mined\u201421 million, for a current total market capitalization of $8.13 billion. Jeremy Allaire, founder, Chairman and CEO of Circle, a bitcoin consumer finance company, said in an interview in London on Monday morning that the auction results will create only a short-term price dip in the market. \u201cThe government is doing it in a very controlled manner; they\u2019re not flooding the market. They\u2019re creating an opportunity for institutional investors, which is a big deal,\u201d Mr. Allaire told The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Allaire\u2019s Circle was a bidder. He said he was awaiting a phone call and email later Monday from the US federal government. He wouldn\u2019t disclose what price his company bid for the bitcoin. Allaire said there was significant market interest in the auction. \u201cThis is classic asset forfeiture. They\u2019re washing these bitcoin clean, with the seal of approval of the US federal government.\u201d For large market participants, whether they be financial intermediaries like Circle or hedge funds that are investing in it as an asset, the auction is a market opportunity to potentially acquire large blocks at a discount. Allaire said that while there was still regulatory uncertainty around bitcoin, the \u201cclouds were parting,\u201d with governments, banks, and traditional institutional investors beginning to take a serious interest in the cryptocurrency. \u201cWhat\xa0we\u2019re hearing is that some of the big broker dealers on Wall Street are setting up\xa0small\xa0trading desks just to get exposure to the asset and understand it.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $585.88, down 2.17% (via CoinDesk) \u2013 We Westerners tend to smugly assume that\xa0China\u2019s tech companies are followers, not innovators \u2013 \xa0that its political-cultural makeup and centrally-planned economy tend to squash inventiveness. But when it comes to digital payments and currencies, China is in many respects leading the world. Mobile payment systems such as those run by Tencent\u2019s WeChat service are well ahead of their Western rivals in terms of widespread adoption and ease of use. So, perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that OKCoin, one of China\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchanges, is among those leading the way into new high-tech trading services. On Monday, the exchange launched a suite of \xa0algorithmic trading tools, adding the capacity for investors to pre-program price-determined trigger orders and to implement \u201ciceberg\u201d stratgies to break up large orders into smaller, better disguised lots, as well as modified time-weighted average price orders. \xa0Such services are more typically associated with high-end professional trading in established markets than with a retail digital-currency platform. But is this a technological advance that is destined to bring stability to the price of bitcoin or merely a means for China\u2019s notoriously speculative investment community to double down its risky bets? The announcement Monday comes after OKCoin revealed an innovative new margin-trading system Friday, whereby bitcoin can be lent on a peer-to-peer basis, with the exchange providing a \xa0matching service between prospective borrowers and lenders. WIth the two announcements, investors now will be able to leverage up their bets by three times the cash amount and attach trading triggers and price-smoothing strategies to those bets. The backstory here is that this year\u2019s crackdown by Chinese authorities against bitcoin exchanges, with whom banks are now barred from doing business, has crimped their ability to service yuan-based customers. So, China-based exchanges such as OKCoin are now aggressively marketing to foreigners, offering prices in dollars and English language web sites. One part of the pitch is that these sophisticated new tools \u2014 algorithms, derivatives and margin-trading \u2014 can boost liquidity in the market by expanding two-way flow. This, in turn, could attract larger individual and professional investors from overseas who find the current bitcoin trading environment too thinly traded for the efficient execution of their large orders. Meanwhile, bitcoiners hope the arrival of these bigger players, along with the new tools for taking offsetting long and short positions, will help end bitcoin\u2019s crazy price volatility and thus boost its appeal as a currency to mainstream users. But there\u2019s a more unappealing way to look at these developments. China\u2019s financial markets have long been the domain of highly speculative investors, the kind who seem especially dominant in its bitcoin markets. With Chinese regulators taking measures to reduce leverage-driven speculation in yuan-based asset markets, bitcoin has provided an outlet for these speculators, even if \xa0constraints on banks have forced them to use cash when depositing yuan with the exchanges. \xa0Margin trading and algorithmic tools offers a chance for these speculative investors to ramp up their bets.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $605.46, down 0.3% (via CoinDesk) Imagine Ford Motor Corp. sponsoring a football game and choosing to name it the Automobile Bowl. Why would one company willingly spend money to promote everyone else in its industry, including its competitors, and not include its own name in the branding? Well, that\u2019s effectively what digital-currency payment processor BitPay did when it went with \u201cBitcoin\u201d rather than its own name in a deal with ESPN Events to sponsor the postseason college football game in St. Petersburg. But in the context of a nascent industry in which everyone\u2019s fortunes depend on expanded mainstream adoption of that industry\u2019s common infrastructure, going with \u201cSt. Petersburg Bitcoin Bowl\u201d makes more sense than it might seem at first glance. At this stage, with only 1% of the U.S. population having used bitcoins for payment, \u201ceverybody in the industry has an incentive to grow the pie,\u201d says BitPay Executive Chairman Tony Gallippi, predicting that the digital currency would eventually be used by 90%. \u201cIf bitcoin fails, we all fail; if bitcoin succeeds we all succeed.\u201d This collaborative approach to marketing is possible only at these early stages of growth. Once an industry reaches maturity , the battle for market share becomes more ruthless. For now, Bitpay gets to kill two birds with one stone. It promotes bitcoin, which is ultimately in its interests and gets to associate its own name, via other marketing materials, with whatever surge of interest the\xa0 digital currency gets from this sponsorship. It\u2019s also not the first instance of BitPay investing in the broader interests of the bitcoin community but getting something in return. The payment processor pays the salary of programmer Jeff Garzik, for example, who works as one of the three full-time staffers on the core development team that maintains bitcoin\u2019s central software. The relationship affords BitPay special insights for its own programming capacity.

SnapCard is offering 50 BTC to anybody who can complete a perfect bracket in the 2014 World Cup. At current prices, that about $50,000 in fiat. That\u2019s a far cry from $1 billion. This spring Quicken Loan\u2019s offered and Mr. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway insured a $1 billion prize to the entrant who predicted the winner of every game of the NCAA tournament. The odds of winning SnapCard\u2019s contest are\xa0roughly 1:274,877,906,944. And there\u2019s a catch: SnapCard began the promotion Tuesday and the window to enter closes on Thursday. That means you have a couple of days to let games be decided on the field before you have to submit a card. As a consolation, given the long odds, the person who lasts the longest will get 1 bitcoin. Second place gets half a bitcoin, third and fourth place get a quarter of a bitcoin. Unlike similar contests, a purchase is necessary to qualify: contestants have to spend at $75 in transactions on snapCard\u2019s website between now and month\u2019s end (Mr. Buffett\u2019s promotion, which was run in conjunction with Quicken Loans and Yahoo, did require contestants to fill out a survey about mortgages).

In a press release, the bitcoin security startup said the new Series A round investor was led by venture capital firm Redpoint Ventures and included contributions from Radar Partners, Founders Fund, Barry Silbert\u2019s Bitcoin Opportunity Corp. and Ashton Kutcher\u2019s A-Grade Investments. Previous investors Bridgescale Partners, Jeff Skoll, Bill Lee, and Eric Hahn participated in the round. Radar Partners\u2019 Stratton Sclavos, a former CEO of Internet certificate authority Verisign, will join BitGo\u2019s board along with Redpoint founding partner Jeff Brody. The involvement of Sclavos carries symbolic significance for BitGo, which in the words of its Chief Executive Will O\u2019Brien, has \u201cambitions to secure the world\u2019s bitcoins.\u201d It\u2019s also relevant to bitcoin more broadly, with the general public still wary of trusting a digital currency and payment technology that has been subject to massive losses and some troubling hacking attacks. Early in Mr. Sclavos\u2019s tenure at Verisign, the company used the Internet\u2019s Secure Sockets Layer encryption tool, better known as SSL, to develop an authentication system for e-commerce web sites. This led Verisign to became the Internet\u2019s leading certificate authority in the mid-1990s, its ubiquitous logo emerging as a de facto stamp of trust. Along with similar services by other firms, this encouraged people to start making payments over the Internet. Mr. Sclavos left the firm in 2007 and it was later sold to Symantec Mr. Sclavos says he was struck by the similarities between those early days of the Internet and bitcoin\u2019s current development phase, as its backers try to build legitimacy and encourage mainstream adoption. Back in mid-1990s, when Verisign was founded, \u201cyou had millions of browsers downloaded and tens of thousands of web sites but you really had no idea where you were going or who was behind the web sites,\u201d Mr. Sclavos said in an interview. \u201cThis seemed to us incredibly similar to bitcoin, which is still in the wild, wild west phase, still volatile, [people] not being sure exactly who to trust and what is happening with bitcoins in a wallet and where they are going if something goes wrong \u2026 to now having BitGo there to create a trusted infrastructure, using standard technology.\u201d In April, when the bitcoin community was still roiling from news that now defunct exchange Mt. Gox had lost 850,000 bitcoins, worth around $500 million at the time, BitGo rolled out BitGo Enterprise, the first digital wallet that uses \u201ctwo-of-three\u201d multi-signature technology as an added layer of protection. Under this arrangement, digital coins cannot be released from a wallet unless two of three private keys \u2014 the unique alphanumeric codes used to digitally \u201csign\u201d encrypted transactions \u2014 are applied to it. For each wallet, BitGo generates three different keys, one that\u2019s attached to the live, online wallet and controlled by the owner, one that\u2019s held in an encrypted format by BitGo, and a third that\u2019s held offline in so-called \u201ccold storage\u201d by the owner. That way, if owners want to take complete charge of their bitcoins without requiring the engagement of a third-party institution, they can do so. But under all other circumstances, the engagement of the firm\u2019s second online key helps ensure the speed, efficiency and security of transactions. In an interview, Mr. O\u2019Brien said in addition to marketing its BitGo Enterprise wallet, his firm is now reaching out to businesses that use bitcoin and offering them a chance to use its multi-sig platform in their own wallets and internal protections. He sees this specialized service in keeping with where the bitcoin economy will head \u201cin parallel to the way the Internet developed.\u201d \u201cNow that the Internet has matured you don\u2019t have everyone operating web servers, or operating systems or operating languages. There\u2019s specialization that takes place along the way,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThat way the entrepreneurial system can move faster, build on top of what other companies have developed and build on top of standards.\u201d Write to Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$618.41, down 1.5% (via\xa0CoinDesk) \u2013The bitcoin community gets excited whenever big-name retailers agree to accept bitcoin payments \u2013 recent examples being Dish Network and Expedia. But many argue that the true mainstream bitcoin adoption must come from consumers themselves and for that you need incentives to shift from physical wallets to virtual wallets. Payment processor and digital wallet provider Coinbase has a new discounting service that could help in that drive: a tool allowing its merchant clients to pass on their bitcoin-based cost savings to customers. According to a Coinbase blog post published Thursday, merchants can choose to automatically apply a percentage-based discount of up to 25% to customers using bitcoin. Under traditional electronic payments, merchants are on the hook for fees levied by banks, credit-card companies and payment-processing firms \u2013 usually about 3% for credit cards \u2013 as well as for any \u201cchargebacks\u201d and other costs that can arise from fraud or theft. Given that many retailers operate on tight margins, those costs can make a difference and can limit their ability to compete on lower prices. But fees on bitcoin transaction are much closer to zero. Coinbase is betting that some merchants will want to convert the extra profit margin from bitcoin sales into a price advantage over competitors that aren\u2019t set up to receive the digital currency. Coinbase says three of its merchant clients \u2013 online florist BloomNation, bitcoin-focused e-commerce site BitDazzle and bulk gift card discounter eGifter \u2013 have so far signed up for the service. (Michael Casey) - Ripple Labs\u2019 promise to provide cheap and fast international money transfer and exchange services over its decentralized digital currency network has gotten a lift from a partnership with one the region\u2019s major money transmitters. According to a joint press release, U.K.-owned AstroPay, which claims to have the largest cross-border payments service in Latin America, has just launched Ripple LatAm, a licensed system of regional payment transactions. The service will connect Latin American businesses with counterparts around the world for \u201cfast and affordable remittances, merchant payments, and more,\u201d the statement said. The Ripple system, managed by San Francisco-based Ripple Labs, facilitates low-cost and super-fast global payments and foreign exchange transactions by a system of digital IOUs that are exchanged over a decentralized network of computers. By allowing designated gateways \u2013 typically banks, remittance companies, foreign exchange houses and money transmitters \u2013 to exploit that rapid and low-cost system for confirming transactions, Ripple aims to greatly reduce the cost and time delays of money wires and foreign exchange within and between currencies. Ripple is often looked upon as something of a competitor to bitcoin, which also runs off a decentralized network and uses a universal ledger to confirm transactions. However, it is quite different in that it is agnostic about the currency. Outside users can go to a gateway that supports payments in Brazilian reals, for example, and ask it to send them to a third party in Europe in euros. The press release said that at its launch Ripple LatAm would serve seven countries, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay.  Astropay currently has 600,000 customers in those seven countries conducting 5,000 unique transactions a day, the release said. \xa0(Michael Casey) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

The site accepts bets and pays out winnings only in bitcoin, the digital currency currently valued at around $650 a digital coin. Bets can be made for sports ranging from curling to basketball, but it\u2019s the World Cup that BetVIP hopes will give the site a running start. \u201cThe main bets we have seen so far are either Brazil to win outright or the country that the user is from to win outright.

A handful of other sites are popping up specifically to allow gamblers to place bets with bitcoin on the outcome of matches.

BetVIP holds a gaming license in Curacao, in the Caribbean, and only accepts bets in regulated markets. The site doesn\u2019t accept bets from the U.S., which has outlawed online gambling, he says. Mr. Schwartzkopff says his site has received bets worth about 50 bitcoins from people in a range of countries including China, Australia, Serbia and the Netherlands. In the past few days, the company says the majority of bets coming in have been for the upcoming World Cup. The benefit of bitcoin, he says, is that people can make instant deposits and withdrawals.

Still the price continues to wildly fluctuate, but even after falling sharply this year, it remains well above the price it fetched at the beginning of 2013. Bitcoin has also attracted controversy, including the collapse of exchange Mt.

Overstock.com started accepting it in January, and the Chicago Sun-Times began accepting it in April. Dish Network announced in May that it would start accepting bitcoin. There are other travel-related services out there that take bitcoin, some smaller individual travel agencies and 9Flats, an online apartment rental site. CheapAir.com began accepting it in November. But none have the size or exposure of Expedia, which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest full-service travel site. Mr. Gulmann said the company isn\u2019t expecting a groundswell of bitcoin-related business, despite the internal optimism about it. But they do see it as part of their future, primarily because they see it as another way to serve their customers. \u201cIf we\u2019re solving a customer need then we\u2019re going to take it,\u201d he said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/11/expedia-starts-accepting-bitcoin-for-hotel-bookings/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 11, 8, 0), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Expedia Starts Accepting Bitcoin for Hotel Bookings'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $649.21, up 0.6% (via CoinDesk) \u2013It\u2019s probably too much to say bitcoin will be a determining factor in this year\u2019s mid-term elections, but a recent Federal Election Commission ruling permitting U.S. candidates to accept the digital currency has many bitcoiners excited about the chance to vote with their coins. The ruling also has created an opportunity that startup CoinVox wants to exploit and a chance for bitcoin advocates to gain more friendly supporters of constructive regulation on Capitol Hill. CoinVox is marketing a user-friendly website interface for accepting donations in bitcion\xa0to political candidates and action committees that ensures they stay compliant with FEC reporting requirements and campaign finance laws. CEO Chris David plans to launch the service at an event sponsored by startup accelerator Plug & Play in San Francisco on Thursday. Based on legal advice and statements by FEC Chairman Lee Goodman, the firm has adopted a fairly liberal interpretation of a key FEC advisory in May and so is assuming that donors can provide more than $100 worth of bitcoin per electoral cycle to each candidate. At the time of the May advisory, the Commission unanimously agreed to accept a request from Make Your Laws, a non-partisan political action committee focused on campaign finance reform, to allow it to accept up to $100 in bitcoins from a single contributor per cycle. However, the six-member commission was split down party lines on whether to allow the PAC to accept more than $100 if it wished, a position that would exempt it from the hard limit that currently applies to cash-only donations. Mr. Goodman, a Republican, issued a statement declaring that the opinion \u201cin no way establishes the outer boundary for the contributions and use of bitcoin.\u201d He suggested that because the commission had not ruled against permitting a larger amount, the limits that apply to donations by check and other traceable forms of payment \u2013 $2,600 per candidate per year, $5,000 per PAC, $10,000 per state and local party committees, and $97,200 for national committees \u2013 would apply to bitcoin. But Democratic commissioners objected that they had not approved anything. Donations above $100 in bitcoin were neither approved nor disapproved, they said, as this was not Make Our Laws\u2019 request. The fact is that the FEC has not been able to agree on this matter from the start, so various lawyers and number of bitcoin-accepting political candidates are accepting as a default position the idea that no one will ever be successfully sued for accepting larger amounts. Whether or not that\u2019s the case, CoinVox is among those taking that position. And if its service becomes a go-to one for candidates on both sides of the political divide, it may also become the default position for politicians. (Michael Casey) \u2013Bitcoiners are inherently a young crowd. But this takes the cake. According to Mashable, a 15-year-old boy who turned a $1,000 gift from his grandmother into $100,000 in bitcoin trading profits, \xa0has launched an online tutoring service that now has 20 employees.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $644.44, down 1.4% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin mining, the activity that brings bitcoins into existence and keeps the digital currency\u2019s all-important blockchain ledger intact, has come a long way from the basement hobby it was for early enthusiasts. As bitcoin\u2019s price has risen, an arms race has produced an exponential increase \xa0in computing power\xa0across the network, all for the sole purpose of \xa0winning the rights to bitcoins. Increasingly, the only way to guarantee decent profit margins on this capital-intensive business\xa0 is to go large scale. What does that mean in a physical, real-world sense? Well the above video of an installation by mining rig manufacturer CoinTerra at a datacenter in Utah brings it home. Behold the industrialized future of bitcoin mining. If it sounds like a hurricane, it\u2019s because of the high-powered fans\xa0needed to cool\xa0the 500 CoinTerra TerraMiner ASIC rigs. Each rig in this particular arrangement is capable of computing 1.6 terahashes per second. In other words, every second they calculate 1.6 trillion of the special numbers that are computed and discarded in a race to find the one that will seal off the latest 10-minute block of confirmed transactions. Like every other mining rig around the world, they are racing to be the first to find that number, for which they are rewarded with a new batch of 25 bitcoins, their compensation for acting as bitcoin\u2019s ledger keepers. All of that hashing activity demands an enormous amount of electricity \u2014 at around 20 kilowatts for a stack of ten rigs, each column in this installation consumes almost 10 times as much power as a rack of regular computer servers of the same size. In this case, the facility uses the ambient, dry cool air of the Utah desert to cool down the rigs. The rigs\u2019 fans suck the air in from outside through a filter and then push it through to a sealed area at the back. From there, the hot air is released via an exhaust to the outside. Air conditioning is rarely needed, ensuring a big cost saving. According to CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar, who gave us a tour of the facility and showed us another 1,500 boxes of rigs to be installed there soon, this particular datacenter will by the end of June have a total hashing power of 4 petahashes per second. That\u2019s a total of 4,000 trillion hashes \xa0per second. The company\u2019s near-term goal is to have 10 petahashes installed\xa0across all of its datacenter locations in North America. CoinTerra will use some of that capacity to mine on its own behalf; some of it will be leased out to individuals and businesses on 12-month contracts. The company even has demand from one customer seeking to rent an entire petahash per second. To put all this in perspective, the bitcoin network\u2019s\xa0total hashing rate\xa0is currently 79 petahashes per second, according to Blockchain.info, down from a recent peak just below 100 but 564 times higher than the 140 terahashes it handled just a year ago. The computing power needed to achieve this is now\xa06,000 times more powerful than the top 500 supercomputers of the world\xa0combined, according to Bitcoin Magazine. Three reasons why is this manic increase is happening: -Even if bitcoin\u2019s price is well down from its $1,165 December peak, coins are \xa0considered valuable and scarce, given that only a finite number will ever be released. -Bitcoin\u2019s guiding algorithm, which enlists miners to confirm transactions and authenticate and maintain the payment system\u2019s blockchain transaction ledger, deliberately makes it increasingly difficult for one of them to find the winning hash. That\u2019s so that the current 25-bitcoin payout to winner of this lottery-based compensation system continues at steady 10-minute intervals. -The technology behind the ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) chips used to perform the bitcoin hashing task is improving exponentially . This noisy, power-hungry, expensive business is no longer something to do in your basement. (Michael Casey) - If you\u2019re going to compete with all that, it helps to have a supercomputer at your disposal. Of course, it\u2019s a problem if the supercomputer in question doesn\u2019t belong to you. Tucked into the National Science Foundation\u2019s semiannual report to Congress is a notice about an unnamed researcher who\u2019d been using the NSF\u2019s access to mine bitcoin, as reported earlier by Bitcoin Magazine. This is an ingenious solution to the vexing cost problem in mining. A huge swath of mining has moved to the cloud (as illustrated above), because of the costs. The NSF estimated the researcher drilled about $150,000 of NSF-supported computer usage at two universities to generate between $8,000-$10,000 worth of bitcoin. The problem with that \u2013 besides the net loss he generated \u2013 is the fact that he was not authorized to mine for bitcoin. The researcher\u2019s access was revoked, and he was banned government-wide by the NSF. A representative of the agency said the investigation is ongoing, and should be complete before the September report.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $648.63, down 1.1% (via CoinDesk) - Wallet provider Blockchain\u2019s breakneck growth continues to compound on itself.\xa0This offers hopes for bitcoin purists who want Blockchain\u2019s policy of leaving users in charge of their own wallet security to trump a model pushed by others that tends toward more centralized custodial services. It also shows the potential for bitcoin adoption in developing countries, where the company is making a big push. Blockchain has now issued 1.7 million wallets, up from 200,000 a year ago today and 1 million in January, says Nicolas Cary, the CEO, adding that these days the company\u2019s seeing about as much growth outside the U.S. as inside. Like many bitcoin advocates, it appears that Blockchain sees the future of digital currencies lying less in a promise to save Americans a few bucks on their credit-card purchases and more as force for global financial integration. It sees great potential among people whose financial systems are either dysfunctional, like Argentina\u2019s, or inaccessible, like those of many African countries. \u201cWe are seeing a huge amount of growth outside of U.S. borders,\u201d said the London-based Cary, who chatted to us during a brief swing through New York this week. \u201cIn a lot of ways, bitcoin is not that easy of a sell in North America. There\u2019s a financial s system that provides access to a lot of people here\u2026but outside of these borders and in places we\u2019ve traveled like Argentina, North Africa and Southeast Asia, bitcoin is way easier to talk about to people who are basically leapfrogging through legacy systems.\u201d Cary shared a story of a recent taxi ride upon arriving in Buenos Aires, where the driver, when he learned what his passenger did for a living, immediately asked if he could get paid for the ride in bitcoins. \u201cIn Argentina there are probably 100 times more doctors and dentists and restaurants that are accepting bitcoins than here in New York City\u2026and of course they make a religion of destroying their economy there,\u201d Cary said. Bitbeat caught up with Cary and his COO, Peter Smith, on a sunny afternoon in the rooftop garden of a Westside Manhattan apartment complex. Armed with an array of worn smartphones that they use to demonstrate their products to people around the world, they showed us a mobile app that Cary described as a \u201ca simple way for any merchant to replace a $30,000 point-of-sale system in 30 seconds\u201d and raved about their upcoming, closely guarded Android-based wallet. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making huge investments in infrastructure,\u201d Cary said, explaining that ongoing development work is required to maintain an extensive in-house hosting system. Smith said that keeping Blockchain\u2019s infrastructure up to scale is an ongoing challenge and that he is basically doubling every budgeted resource needs beyond initial projections. The pair is adamant that their success proves growth is possible for a service that leaves customers fully in charge of securing their wallet and the personal keys used to unlock their bitcoins. They contrast their model with a trend toward \u201ccentralization\u201d that they identify among various bitcoin companies. Smith said services offered by various newcomers to the industry such as insurance and in-house private-key custody are in effect recreating the risky silo-based banking model that failed the world in 2008. Neither named any names but Circle jumps to mind. The newly launched project intends to provide \u201cmilitary grade\u201d security for customers that deposit their bitcoins with the firm, says Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who believes such services are needed to attract a new breed of users\xa0\u201cwho don\u2019t think in bitcoin.\u201d (Michael Casey) Contacts: paul.vigna@wsj.com, @paulvigna / michael.casey@wsj.com, @mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/06/bitbeat-for-blockchain-keeping-the-faith-is-paying-off/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 6, 6, 18, 8), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: For Blockchain, Keeping the Faith Is Paying Off'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $657.25, up 3.2% (via CoinDesk) - Blackcoin would like you to know that they\u2019re out there, too.\xa0The altcoin has been climbing the market-cap leaderboard, recently cracking the top 10. Launched in February by a Russian developer, who goes by the handle \u201crat4,\u201d its market cap currently is $13.5 million. It also was added this week to CoinKite, a cryptocurrency exchange, joining larger peers bitcoin and litecoin. Blackcoin\u2019s addition to CoinKite didn\u2019t happen by accident. The group has been actively marketing itself, and hired a PR firm, Max Borges Agency. (The agency, interestingly enough, accepted 3% of its contract in blackcoin). As Blackcoin tries to stand above a noisy and chaotic marketplace for hundreds of altcoins, most of which have no hope of ever achieving any kind of scale, its marketing and branding has evolved. The coin initially set itself up as a kind of \u201cluxury\u201d coin, not unlike the American Express invitation-only \u201cBlack Card.\u201d\xa0But lately its proponents are playing up the coin\u2019s more fundamentally interesting features, selling it as a more environmentally friendly, fairer coin. Blackcoin isn\u2019t \u201cmined\u201d like bitcoin, it\u2019s \u201cminted,\u201d utilizing a proof-of-stake system as opposed to bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work system (we don\u2019t have the space here to explain the difference; Bitcoin Magazine has a good explanation of the difference). Others using this system include Nextcoin and Peercoin. The upshot is that blackcoin transactions can be confirmed in less time than bitcoin transactions. And it doesn\u2019t force its community into a messy, costly and high-energy consuming arms race of technology. \xa0\u201cIt\u2019s simpler, faster, greener,\u201d said Adam Kryskow, a representative of the Blackcoin Foundation. Wallet-holders whose computers are used to confirm transactions get paid 1% interest in new coins for their services. The system, Mr. Kryskow said, makes blackcoin similar to an interest-bearing checking account (where rates in the real world range anywhere from 0.01% to 0.76%). Still, it\u2019s got a ways to go before it\u2019s competitive with bitcoin and its $8.4 billion market cap, to say nothing of the scrum of other coins, where so many seem to come, get some attention, and then flame out. But if the Blackcoin community can make its differences their selling point, they may have something. They might want to consider changing that name, too.

The most active investor so far has been 500 Startups, which bought stakes in five companies. BitPay and its $30 million funding round is the top fund-raiser this year (or any year for that matter). It all illustrates that bitcoin continues to be a hot item in the VC world, despite the volatility and notoriety. That said, it\u2019s a small flame within the entire VC universe. Total VC fund-raising reached $12.4 billion\xa0in the first five months of 2014. (Paul Vigna) UPDATE: Max Borges Agency is a public relations firm.

At its Worldwide Developers Conference in California on Monday, Apple released new guidelines for developing apps, which includes an opening for apps that deal in virtual-currency payments. \u201cApps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions.\u201d You can see the guidelines here. On the one hand, the company is saying it\u2019s open to apps like Blockchain\u2019s wallet service, which if you recall, was removed from the App Store in February. On the other hand, the guidelines seem to point toward a high bar for acceptance. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big deal,\u201d Dan Held, the director of products at Blockchain, told MoneyBeat. That said, he added the language seemed ambiguous, if not restrictive. However, he said Blockchain plans to resubmit its app, and \u201csee how Apple responds.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to be able to build apps again for a wallet service\u201d for the iPhone.

Big news for the intersection of bitcoin and popular culture as rap superstar 50 Cent, aka Curtis Jackson III, says he\u2019ll accept the digital currency for his new album, Animal Ambition. We couldn\u2019t get \u201cFitty\u201d himself on the horn, but we did speak with Corentin Villemeur, head of new media at G-Unit, the hip hop artist\u2019s own record label. And according to Mr. Villemeur, the artist saw bitcoin as a good fit with his move this year to an independent model in which his own online store would sell music in both digital and CD format. That shift marked a break of 50 Cent\u2019s prior contract with Interscope Records, owned by Universal Media Group. \u201cSince going independent this year, we have more leeway and freedom to figure what we can and can\u2019t do and we are always trying to stay ahead of the curve,\u201d said Mr. Villemeur. He said the staff at G-Unit has been monitoring bitcoin for two years.\xa0 \u201cWe decided it was strong enough and had become such a big concept online that it was the right time to use it,\u201d he said, adding that other artists belong to the G-Unit label would likely also have music and merchandise made available in bitcoin. 50 Cent\u2019s four prior albums will continue to be sold by Interscope. For now at least, you can\u2019t buy those with bitcoin. (Michael Casey) \u2013The buzz continues around Bitcoin 2.0 ventures and now it\u2019s come as \xa0a swarm.  Swarm, an incubator of digital currency-focused startups, is the latest of these big-promising but largely untested projects. Such ventures seek to use decentralized blockchain infrastructure such as bitcoin\u2019s to allow strangers to make all manner of exchanges of value without the involvement of a middleman. These can include anything from real estate deeds to IOUs in foreign currency to cars . In Swarm\u2019s case, the startups will issue their own custom-made coins whose value will be determined by exchanges over the blockchain \u2013 no Wall Street bank required. Swarm itself plans to offer 100 million SwarmCoins in a similarly automated one-month -long crowdfunding offering scheduled to start June 17 . The coins will give investors rights to the dividends from the startups in the incubator\u2019s portfolio. The firm hopes to raise as much as 21,500 bitcoins through the offering. A document explaining the offering and signed by Swarm\u2019s founder, software developer Joel Dietz, ends with a bit of a dig at Wall Street: \u201cThank you very much Goldman Sachs but we don\u2019t need you any more. Now is the time for the little guy to get back in the game.\u201d (Michael Casey) \u2013If you\u2019re keen on Swarm and other Bitcoin 2.0 offerings, you might want to think about two developments today: One is Erik Voorhees\u2019 settlement with the SEC over the unregistered share offerings he made in SatoshiDICE and FeedZeBirds in 2012 and 2013. It\u2019s a pretty good hint that the U.S. market regulator will have its eye on all these Bitcoin 2.0 offerings. The other is a well researched article about the recent Maidsafe offering by Kashmir Hill over at Forbes.

Various independent artists have made their music available in bitcion and some lesser-known figures have embraced the digital currency by singing about it.

He bought nearly 1,000 BTC for between $8-$12, expecting that he might realize a profit in five or 10 years. In 2013, he tried to again turn \u201cAimy\u201d into a film. He culled an entire production team together from people he found on the Internet, but still couldn\u2019t come up with financing. Then bitcoin prices started rising. When late in 2013 it hit $1,000, he realized he could use it to fund his movie. He cashed out in January in the $650 range. It was enough to finance the film. Once he had the financing, people were willing to read the script. \u201cThey were really touched by the intensity\u201d of the story, he said. \u201cReally it\u2019s the story that connected them.\u201d The story revolves around a teenage girl and her oppressive family. The rebellious girl clashes with the family, which takes all of her freedoms away, finally having her declared insane and locked in her room. The tables are turned when a virus outbreak leads to a government crackdown, leaving the family locked in the house with their daughter. Where the daughter was under her family\u2019s abusive thumb, the family finds itself under the abusive thumb of the government. Like we said, it\u2019s dystopian. Initial filming was done in Boston, on a budget of $250,000 that quickly \u201cspiraled out of control with all these movie-star demands,\u201d Mr. Jackson joked. The film ended up costing $500,000, he said. He\u2019s looking to release it in the fall, and to get it on the film-festival circuit.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $608.97, up 7.7% (via CoinDesk) - It\u2019s like a weight has been lifted from the shoulders of the bitcoin community. The first four months of 2014 will go down as ones that bitcoiners would rather forget. The headlines were brutal: an arrested entrepreneur, the collapse of a major trading exchange, a full-scale hacking attack on the bitcoin network, a Chinese regulatory crackdown, and the arrival of the U.S taxman. All that helped shave two-thirds off bitcoin\u2019s price. But it now looks like May will be remembered as the month in which the spirits of the community were lifted once more. Not only has the price recovered a bit \u2013 it rose above $600 Friday for the first time since mid-March and is now up 34% in the past month, according to Coindesk \u2013 but the news has been more positive. We had reminders that the venture-capital community remains very energized by the promise bitcoin holds as an international payments technology and as a disruptive force in the economy, with payment processor Bitpay announcing\xa0 the biggest ever financing round at $30 million. We also had the similarly well-funded Circle unveil its plans for a high-security deposit and payments service. And there were clear signs that corporate America, Wall Street and the Washington establishment were coming around to the promise of bitcoin. Former Treasury Secretary and perennial Washington insider Larry Summers lauded bitcoin\u2019s potential to disrupt a financial system that\u2019s \u201cripe for disruption\u201d around the same time that Bloomberg said it would start listing bitcoin prices. Then eBay CEO\xa0John Donahoe called the digital currency an \u201cexciting and emerging technology\u201d and a Federal Reserve advisory panel of bankers said bitcoin could be \u201cboon\u201d to economic activity. Finally, on Thursday, Dish Network became the largest company in the world to say it will accept bitcoin. No wonder the biction \u201cTo the Moon Guy\u201d mascot is getting more love on Reddit. (Michael Casey) - Call it the \u201cBitcoin for Dummies\u201d movement.\xa0Lately there\u2019s been a flurry of bitcoin-related businesses that are making a point of building products that aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cbitcoin\u201d products. There was Jeremy Allaire\u2019s Circle, and BitPesa; both are finanical-services products that ride the bitcoin rails but aim to make the whole experience less techie and more straightforward. Yesterday, CoinBase introduced \u201cPersonal Pages,\u201d which are basically social media widgets you plug into your Facebook page, and today there\u2019s another entry in this field, called QuickCoin, which its creators are touting as the first \u201ckiller app\u201d for bitcoin. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sending bitcoin as simple as sending a Facebook message,\u201d the firm said in an email. The idea behind QuickCoin is to make bitcoin transactions, well, quick, and simple. The app runs through Facebook or other social media. It has buttons to send or receive bitcoins, making transferring the digital currency about as complex as sending a text message. It reminds us of something Alex Daley of Casey Research told us back in February:\xa0that if bitcoin survives its growing pains, it will probably end up being the kind of system that runs in the background, and most people using it don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re using it. More and more, that appears to be the way things are going.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $xx,up/ down xx% (via CoinDesk) - What exactly should one make of the news today that Dish Network will start offering a bitcoin-payment option? It\u2019s big, in the sense that a publicly traded corporation with a $27 billion market cap is now jumping on the cryptocurrency-bandwagon. On the other hand, Dish is only one of more than 60,000 merchants that accepts bitcoin, and it\u2019s not at all clear how many of its 14 million subscriber will avail themselves of the option (although it\u2019s a great get, as they say in Hollywood, for Coinbase, the company that will be supplying the payment services). Like we said in our earlier post, if you think of bitcoin\u2019s journey as building a Crypto-Yellow Brick Road, the Dish news is just one more brick, and the Emerald City is still a long, long ways off. To us, the size of Dish\u2019s market cap is less important than what that the company does: television. Boring, old, television. Yes, it\u2019s a satellite business, which is slightly more high-tech than the cable business, which in itself is more high-tech than the broadcast business. Still, in our mind what Dish does is close to a utility service. Utilities, as any Wall Street analyst will tell you, are boring. But, as we argued some time ago, for bitcoin, boring is good. It\u2019s certainly headline-worthy that somebody like Sir Richard Branson likes bitcoin enough to use it with his space-tourism business. It\u2019s certainly cool in a gee-whiz way that some bitcoiners want to launch a satellite into space to transmit the blockchain. But when a company that does nothing more exciting than broadcasting television stations decides to adopt bitcoin, it\u2019s another sign that the digital currency is getting further integrated into normal, every day life. (Paul Vigna) - Speaking of Coinbase, the payments processor released a new feature on Wednesday called Payment Pages. They\u2019re basically little personalized web pages, hosted within the Coinbase site. The idea is, users will have a URL that links to their own page that can be used on, for example, on Facebook for transacting their digital-currency business. In a blog post, the company noted three users, Marc Andreessen, Code.org, and Nasir Jones, will be promoting their personal pages, and accepting donations through June 6 for charity. (Paul Vigna) - If you\u2019re in lower Manhattan this evening or thereabouts, the Bitcoin Center is throwing a launch party this evening, starting at 6 p.m., for Jenna Lash, an artist whose currency-themed works will be displayed at the center through September.

It\u2019s not likely that all 14 million Dish subscribers are going to rush into their account pages and switch to bitcoin. Like most bitcoin-related things, this is a move with an eye on the future. \u201cBitcoin is becoming a preferred way for some people to transact and we want to accommodate those individuals,\u201d the company said in a press release. It\u2019s a cautious statement, really, when you break it down: \u201csome people\u201d and \u201cthose individuals\u201d aren\u2019t exactly gushing praise. Still, Dish joins a growing number of merchants that accept digital currencies. BitPay, one of the big processing-services providers, has 30,000 merchants that use its services, and announced on Tuesday it is processing more than $1 million a day in payments. Coinbase, another big processor, has more than 31,000 merchants, including the Chicago Sun-Times, the Sacramento Kings \u2013 and now Dish Network. It\u2019s a notable but not overwhelming piece of news. Think of it this way: If bitcoiners are building a Yellow Brick Road, then this Dish Network news is one more brick in that road. The Emerald City, though, remains off on the horizon (assuming the city represents widespread, mainstream adoption; if you\u2019re a cryptoanarchist, this news has a completely different connotation.)\xa0Bitcoin prices didn\u2019t move on the news: the price is actually down about 2% on Thursday around $563, according to CoinDesk. What follows is a comparison of some other big companies to take the cryptocurrency. (Note that we\u2019re providing sales figures here to illustrate the size of the companies; those are not bitcoin sales.) Dish Network.\xa0Beginning in July, Dish Network\u2019s 14 million subscribers will have the option to pay their subscription fees with bitcoin. Dish\u2019s current market cap is about $27.2 billion, and its 2013 revenue was $13.9 billion. Overstock.com.\xa0Overstock adopted bitcoin as a payment method in December 2013, becoming the first big retailer to do so. The company has a $368 million market cap and had 2013 revenue of $1.3 billion. Patrick Byrne, the company\u2019s CEO, said on Fox Business on Tuesday the company has sold more than $1.6 million worth of goods in bitcoin so far. Virgin Galactic.\xa0Sir Richard Branson announced in November 2013 that his space tourism company would accept bitcoin. Now, on the one hand, Virgin Galactic is part of Sir Richard\u2019s sprawling Virgin Group, which had north of $24 billion in revenue in 2012. That\u2019s big. On the other hand, Virgin Galactic is the only part of that sprawling conglomerate that is taking bitcoin \u2013 and has sold only a few tickets via bitcoin. Etsy.\xa0The online arts-and-craft marketplace has had a bitcoin option for its merchants since at least 2011. The site\u2019s overall revenue topped $1 billion in 2013.

The founder of 798 Satoshi Square, a bitcoin informational and meetup site \xa0in Beijing\u2019s art district, has teamed up with Robocoin to give mainland China its first two-way bitcoin ATM. Ever since \xa0the PBOC blocked banks from servicing digital-currency exchanges last month, regulatory guidelines in China have been vague.

They know that the government has not banned bitcoin itself and presumably are buying into the argument that Beijing wants to control, not kill, the growth of cryptocurrencies. After all, as we wrote last week, China\u2019s e-commerce-driven population is already a long way ahead of other places in the use of digital money. It\u2019s something the government will ultimately find very difficult to clamp down on. (Michael Casey) -WedBush Securities analysts Gil Luria and Aaron Turner make some big claims about cryptocurrencies\u2019 potential for economic disruption in their latest take on bitcoin\u2019s future. In a report entitled \u201cTiming and Sizing the Era of Bitcoin,\u201d Messrs. Luria and Turner argue that \u201cbitcoin-related technologies will disrupt payments markets and other trust-based markets within the next few years and for decades to follow.\u201d How much disruption? \u201cSubstantial,\u201d the Wedbush analysts say, \u201cconsidering 20% of U.S. GDP is generated by industries whose main function is as a trusted third party.\u201d That\u2019s a big statement. They\u2019re referring to a host of new innovations \u2013 smart contracts that need no lawyer, IPOs that need no underwriter, real estate transactions that need no broker \u2013 which use decentralized cryptocurrency-based systems of verification instead of trust-based agency services. The upshot is that the jobs of lawyers, bankers, insurance agents and countless other such \u201ctrusted third-party\u201d middlemen are potentially on the line. Meanwhile, efficient bitcoin-based payment processing stands to cut deeply into U.S. banks\u2019 fee revenue, which runs to $250 billion a year, and into global payments-related revenues, which exceed $300 billion a year, they wrote. Messrs. Luria and Turner also see big opportunities for automated digital-currency payments in the so-called \u201cInternet of Things.\u201d The way they see it, devices and gadgets that communicate with each other will also make payments to each other with bitcoin or some other digital currency. One early \u201cmachine-to-machine\u201d application they foresee would be the use of bitcoin-based technology to ward off distributed denial of service, or DDOS, attacks on computer networks. Mr. Luria explained that smart network technology could be used to detect when an\xa0 entity wants to use large amounts of a network\u2019s resources and charge it for the privilege, creating a powerful disincentive for malevolent DDOS attackers to ply their trade.

Gox is looking to sell the trademarked word bitcoin, a company executive said. The company hopes to raise at least\xa0\xa5100 million, or about $1 million, for a package including the bitcoin trademarks in Japan and the European Union as well as the bitcoins.com domain name, the executive said. It is unclear if any money from the sale of the rights would be used to pay back the creditors of Mt. Gox. The executive said the company wanted to sell the trademarks because it had no use for them. Tibanne, a company headed by former Mt. Gox chief Mark Karpeles, had its registration of the bitcoin trademark approved in Japan and the EU in 2012, according to the online databases of the patent authorities for each territory. The trademarks will expire in 2021 in the EU and in 2022 in Japan, though they are both renewable if fees are paid. Tibanne was effectively the operator of the troubled bitcoin exchange since Mt. Gox had no staff. The two companies share the same office address in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya district. Tibanne\u2019s lawyers could not be reached for comment. Lawyers familiar with bankruptcy proceedings who are not involved in the exchange\u2019s case said that Tibanne has no legal obligation to repay the 127,000 creditors of the exchange. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in late February, saying it had debts of \xa56.5 billion and that it had lost 850,000 bitcoin. It later said it recovered about 200,000 of the missing bitcoin. Should Tibanne raise funds from a sale of the trademark package without using at least part of the proceeds to help creditors of Mt. Gox, that would likely anger those who are out of pocket following the collapse of the exchange. \u201cEven though the company is not obligated to, it should repay customers with assets it has. That\u2019s the way it should be. For anyone it\u2019s obvious that Tibanne and Mt. Gox were operating as one company,\u201d said Keiichi Hida, a Mt. Gox creditor. Prospective buyers would also have to consider how enforceable the trademarks are. A spokeswoman from Japan\u2019s patent office said that trademark holders can exercise the right of owning a word by suing anyone using it without permission, but any judgment on a claim\u2019s validity would have to be made by a court ruling. The office could also consider invalidating a trademark if it thinks the term was already commonly used at the time of registration. Japanese lawyers not involved in the Mt. Gox case said it would be difficult for anyone to profit from owning the bitcoin trademarks since the word was first coined by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in a 2008 research paper. \u201cIf the holder is Mr. Nakamoto, that would be a different story,\u201d said So Saito, a laywer at Nishimura & Asahi, a major Japanese law firm. But if anyone else is holding the trademark, \u201ccompanies wouldn\u2019t be prohibited from using the word because it has become a common noun.\u201d When the company registered the trademarks it said it was looking to keep use of the word free and stop others from limiting or profiting from the word\u2019s use, according to a press release from Mt.

Gox Operator Looks to Sell Bitcoin Trademarks'}, {'articleText': u' One bitcoin start-up is building what it hopes will become a template for using digital currencies in the developing world, a much-talked-about market for cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s called BitPesa, it\u2019s based in Nairobi, and it\u2019s beginning a beta test this week of its first product, a remittance service for Kenyans living abroad. On Friday, the start-up launched a pilot remittance program involving about 15 Kenyans in London, who can begin using BitPesa to send money back home. If it works, and spreads, it promises to lower the billions currently spent on transfer fees, and, its founders hope, maybe even spark a tech boom in Kenya. BitPesa is the brainchild of Duncan Goldie-Scot, a well-known name in microfinance, and Elizabeth Rossiello, a Queens-born former Credit Suisse banker with a background in microfinance who\u2019s been living in Nairobi the past five years. With Ms. Rossiello acting as CEO, the company has raised $700,000 so far, and its investors include Barry Silbert, founder of CEO of the private asset exchange Second Market, and Joe Mucheru, who runs Google\u2019s East Africa operations; Mr. Mucheru\u2019s investment is a personal one. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about the impact of bitcoin around the world,\u201d Mr. Silbert said. \u201cThis is the company that\u2019s actually executing, that\u2019s setting up the model.\u201d BitPesa\u2019s idea was to focus initially on one \u201ccorridor\u201d for remittances \u2013 the U.K. and Kenya. The company sent its people out to the Kenyan cafes, to meet locals and build up its small group of beta testers. They will begin with about 15 users, and expand over the summer. Ms. Rossiello met Mr. Goldie-Scot when she was doing consulting work, and with his encouragement, the two co-founded BitPesa in November. \u201cI took 30 meetings in two weeks talking about linking bitcoin and M-Pesa,\u201d she said, \u201cand I saw eyes light up.\u201d M-Pesa (pesa is Swahili for money) is a popular mobile money system, unrelated to BitPesa and run by Safaricom, the biggest mobile operator in Kenya. Transaction costs for M-Pesa vary according to the size and type, but they are generally low and the service has improved access for Kenyans. However, remittances still go through traditional money transmitters like Western Union, so those costs remain. More than $400 billion globally was remitted from developing-world emigrants back home in 2013, according to the World Bank, and it expects that number to rise to $506 billion by 2016. \u201cThose are only the official flows,\u201d said the World Bank\u2019s Dilip Ratha. He said the bank estimates nearly another $200 billion gets sent through unofficial channels. \u201cThe total size of the flows is enormous.\u201d Kenyans remitted $1.3 billion back home in 2013, according to Kenya\u2019s central bank. For many developing nations, the remittance business accounts for a larger share of foreign exchange than imports, and the World Bank in particular has a high-profile program in place with the goal of lowering those costs. Those numbers do not include the fees that money transmitters like Western Union, MoneyGram, and WorldRemit charge; in aggregate, it amounts to roughly another 8.4%, according to the World Bank. But Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest remittances costs, with an average of 11.7%. For Kenyans in the U.K. sending money home, the total cost can range anywhere from just under 6% to nearly 13%, according to the World Bank. BitPesa\u2019s fee will be a flat 3%. Senders convert U.K. pounds to bitcoin on the one end, and recipients will receive Kenyan shillings on the other. The system rides on the bitcoin \u201crails,\u201d but it isn\u2019t strictly speaking a bitcoin product. \u201cWe are taking bitcoin, translating it into the local currency, and dispersing it the way people know,\u201d Ms. Rossiello said. The way that people know is cellphones. \u201cEverybody has a phone,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re on a boat in the Indian Ocean with the fishermen, and they\u2019re checking their text messages.\u201d Kenya also has a higher percentage of citizens with bank accounts that most other places in Africa. \u201cThey\u2019re way more financially knowledgeable than people give them credit for. You have to go way into the bush to find people who aren\u2019t.\u201d If it takes off, the savings could be significant\u2013and it can go back into the local economy. Ms. Rossiello isn\u2019t just interested in the remittance business, though. She sees BitPesa as being on the leading edge of a financial and technology boom in Kenya that will be greatly aided by the open-source nature of digital currencies. \u201cThe beauty of the system is it\u2019s decentralized,\u201d she said, \u201cit makes it very easy to use the protocol.\u201d She said the numbers at local meet-ups have been rising sharply, there are more coders, and there are even private groups teaching coding to children. \u201cEvery meet-up has more and more engineers who are doing apps,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting, people are responding, people are excited about it.\u201d It\u2019s typical, at least to a Western mind, to think of the remittance business as geared toward uneducated immigrants and impoverished Africans living in dusty villages. But Ms. Rossiello bristles at such stereotypes. She points out that Nairobi is a cosmopolitan city of 3 million, with an educated professional class. \u201cThey\u2019re not just living in a hut,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to start businesses.\u201d BitPesa will face some of the same challenges of any bitcoin-related enterprise. The firm is working to gain the backing of the local government, for one thing, and it will have to convince people to try something new for another. Getting the blessing of a big telecom company like Safaricom would be key as well. In all those instances, though, BitPesa will be going up against an entrenched competitor in M-Pesa.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/05/23/kenyas-bitpesa-launches-beta-test-of-remittance-service/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 5, 23, 16, 52), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Kenya&rsquo;s BitPesa Launches Beta Test of Remittance Service'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

These offerings tap into a yearning among many in the cryptocurrency community for some kind of fractional metal reserve that might bring badly needed stability to digital currencies such as bitcoin. \u201cBitcoin is a wonderful technology but it needs a little help,\u201d said David Gallo, President and co-founder of Toronto-based Minacoin. \u201cAnd gold has been with us for 5,000 years.\u201d With their pricing hinging upon a potentially volatile mix of alt.coins, bitcoin, dollars and gold, though, it\u2019s near impossible to promise a fixed per-weight price for redemptions in the way that government currencies were backed during the gold standards of yore. There are other problems, too. Unique regulatory challenges exist in promising someone an electronic currency that can be swapped for tangible currency (the tale of Gold & Silver Reserve, whose\xa0 E-gold\xa0 virtual currency saw its creators convicted of money laundering in 2008, offers a cautionary tale). Mr. Gallo\u2019s company purchased two 400-ounce bars of gold, initially with the intent of providing a 100% backing for the yet-to-lauched minacoins. But now he describes the gold reserves as a \u201csymbolic mechanism by which we say we want to stabilize the future currency.\u201d When launched, minacoins will trade as distinct digital assets over bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network and ledger. In this way the company is following in the footsteps of various new digital currencies, assets and contracts that are exploiting bitcoin\u2019s highly efficient transaction technology but doing so with stores of value that are distinct from bitcoins themselves. Minacoin\u2019s launch is currently set for midnight on June 1, though it may be postponed, Mr. Gallo said, while the company works through some unspecified \u201cpending issues.\u201d NoFiatCoin started trading on Jan. 6 under the symbol\xa0 XNF and can be purchased via the Ripple network \u2013 a payment network independent from bitcoin and which attracted attention Thursday after its initial founder said he would liquidate his entire holding of Ripple\u2019s internal currency. So far, according to a chart on NoFiatCoin\u2019s website, XNF\u2019s price performance has been impressive, rising steadily by more than 500% from Jan. 1 to $6.70 currently. We were unable to independently verify those prices. Bullish price charts or not, NoFiatCoin\u2019s claim in its website\u2019s FAQs that \u201cat least 100% of every batch\u201d is backed by its store of gold and silver sits uncomfortably with the reality that only 30% of XNF\u2019s value can be guaranteed\xa0 as redeemable for precious metals. In a January interview at the crypto.la blog, NoFiatCoin holding company Tilmore Investments S.R.L. CEO Robert Reyes said the 30% minimum is needed to protect the dollar value of XNF, as its value could fall very dramatically in an \u201canemic currencies\u201d market. He added that due to the price\xa0volatility of XNF, the extent of the reserves backstop could fluctuate and might at times be far greater than 100% of the XNF value. Mr. Reyes later told us the company is now poised to expand and standardize its gold holdings following an asset merger last week with Arcarius Global Capital S.A. , a Costa Rica-based holding company with interests in precious metals, agriculture and energy.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $518.51, up 6% (via CoinDesk) - It was four years ago today that the first purchase was made using bitcoin, when a Florida programmer bought two Papa John\u2019s pizzas. In the years since, that transaction has become part of bitcoin lore, leading some to dub this day \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day.\u201d We recently caught up with the man responsible for the pizzas, Laszlo Hanyecz. Mr. Hanyecz was a programmer and coder living in Jacksonville, Fla., and part of the fledgling bitcoin community. At this time, bitcoin\u2019s anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was still active in the community himself, and Mr. Hanyecz was one of the ones helping him build out the system. Notably, Hanyecz wrote the first software that allowed bitcoin to run on Macs, and configured the first GPU chip that could run bitcoin. But he was frustrated that nobody was doing anything with their mined bitcoins beyond hoarding them, he said. He decided to try and change that. On a bitcoin forum, he offered 10,000 bitcoins to anybody who would buy him a pizza. Today that\u2019s worth about $5 million at current prices, but back then it was worth about $60. Hanyecz figured that was enough for two pies and compensation for somebody\u2019s time. He finally found a taker, another coder living in the U.K., who called a Papa John\u2019s in Jacksonville, placed the order, and paid with his credit card. Hanyecz sent over the 10,000 bitcoins, and a somewhat confused deliveryman showed up at his door with two pepperoni pizzas. \u201cPizza delivery from London,\u201d he said in an unsure voice. Hanyecz left the offer open, and bought several more pies. But the publicity surrounding his purchase brought more people into bitcoin. As a result, he said, the mining level of difficulty increased, and Hanyecz found himself unable to harvest as many bitcoin as he used to. He then dropped the offer. In the four years since, it\u2019s become much easier, although still very limited, to spend bitcoins, and it has more utility online than in the real world, which is to expected with a digital currency. So far as we know, there aren\u2019t any major pizza chains that take bitcoin (you can, however, go through eGifter, which takes bitcoin), although if you\u2019re in Brooklyn, drop in to Lean Crust Pizza on Fulton Street. We reached out to Papa John\u2019s for comment, by the way. The company didn\u2019t respond, and we\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s aware of its place in bitcoin history. Meanwhile, Hanyecz isn\u2019t very involved in bitcoin anymore, and when we spoke to him yesterday, he wasn\u2019t even aware of Bitcoin Pizza Day, although he was amused by it. He realizes, of course, that he was sitting on a fortune, and essentially blew it on pizzas. If he\u2019s bitter about that, he doesn\u2019t let it show. He\u2019s still in IT, and still dabbles in some of the other altcoins. He seems fine with his place in life, at least that was our impression in talking to him. Still, he said, bemused, \u201cI may have to buy another pizza.\u201d Then he added, \u201calthough I don\u2019t have another 10,000 bitcoins.\u201d On the other hand, we imagine he could find a pie somewhere for less than $5.18 million in fiat. (Paul\xa0Vigna) -And on Bitcoin Pizza Day, the digital currency\u2019s price jumped above $500.\xa0This is the first time the price has been over $500 since late March, according to the Coindesk Bitcoin Index.\xa0After a dismal four-month start to 2014, this week is bringing some renewed hope that good news might again be in the driving seat for bitcoin. Still, as we\u2019ve warned repeatedly over the past week, history tells you to be wary. Volatility will be back. (Michael Casey) -Harvard Professor Kenneth Rogoff is a rock star in economics, if a\xa0sometimes controversial one. So a paper he released this week singing the virtues of digital currency over cash inevitably caught some attention. We\u2019d just like to point out that his central idea \u2014 that digital currency allows a central bank to dial up the impact of monetary policy by taking interest rates into negative territory \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly new.

The Federal Advisory Council,\xa0a Federal Reserve-commissioned committee of bankers that regularly advises the Fed\u2019s board of governors. Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cglobal transmissibility opens new markets to merchants and service providers,\u201d said the report of the May 9 meeting,\xa0which was recently\xa0posted on the Fed\u2019s website\xa0and\xa0first reported Sunday by Bitcoin Magazine. The group said that illicit uses for bitcoin are \u201crampant\u201d but suggested they are no greater for the digital currency than for sovereign-issued currencies. It also said that problems associated with bitcoin\u2019s anonymity are overstated, given the transparency of the sytsem\u2019s public blockchain ledger. Nonetheless, the Council advocated regulation to protect consumers and curtail illicit use. It argued that rules needs to be coordinated across different regions to avoid \u201cbalkanization\u201d and discourage \u201cregulatory arbitrage,\u201d where bitcoin businesses would simply move operations to places with the softest-touch regulation. The group did not see bitcoin posing much of a threat to the banking system, at least for now, in part because of bitcoin\u2019s current security risks and volatility, which hinder mainstream adoption. Over the longer term, however, bitcoin\u2019s impact \u201ccould be more pronounced and require adaptation by payment processors,\u201d the report said. In particular, it foresaw existing payment-processing being forced to accept lower transaction fees and facing especially stiff competition from bitcoin in providing remittances to developing countries and in servicing the \u201cunbanked.\u201d The Federal Advisory Council comprises 12 representatives of the banking industry, each appointed by one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. It membership currently includes James P. Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley, who represents the New York Fed\u2019s district, Jonathan M. Kemper, CEO of Commerce Bank, representing the Kansas City Fed\u2019s district, and David W. Nelms, CEO of Discover, representing the Chicago Fed\u2019s district. \xa0(Michael Casey) - We reported last week on Bare Oaks, a naturist park outside Toronto that began accepting bitcoin (we initially referred to them as a \u201cnudist colony,\u201d a phrase that is used only in the \u201ctextile world\u201d, it was politely explained to us). We said that the park hadn\u2019t yet had any bitcoin transactions, but they\u2019ve actually had two so far, according to the park\u2019s owner and general manager, Stephane Deschenes. Incidentally, the park has been in existence since 1972, he said, and he\u2019s owned it since 2006. The park has about 500 members, and has 2,200 visitors last year. (Paul Vigna) - You may not know it, but the BitBeat team is able to trace its family tree back to the Emerald Isle; yes, we are sons of Erin. So we were particularly interested over the weekend to see news of a new altcoin being launched, Irishcoin. Unlike, say, Auroracoin, which aims to set itself up as a national digital currency for Iceland, Irishcoin has a more tangible goal: to become a currency to promote Irish tourism. \u201cIrish tourism is worth over $3B per year to the Irish economy and IrishCoin intends to utilize the promotional aspects of tourism, providing the coin as a discount token vehicle, a tourist organizational branding opportunity, and for the promotion of the Irish tourism industry,\u201d the backers wrote on their website. The first purchase to utilize the coin was for, as one might expect, a pint of Guinness. Now that\u2019s some great craic, as they say back in Dublin.

Those positions had been vacated by the resignations of Mark Karpeles, the CEO of failed bitcoin exchange Mt.

Internet entrepreneur Jeremy Allaire used the conference to unveil plans for his much-talked-about bitcoin startup, Circle, revealing a highly secure bitcoin deposits and payments service aimed at a broad market. Mr. Allaire was beaten to the punch by another prominent Internet entrepreneur, CNet founder Halsey Minor, who on Thursday launched BitReserve, a service that uses bitcoin technology to allow people to cheaply store and transfer traditional currencies in digital form. BitReserve was not launched in Amsterdam, but the conference does have a new BitReserve employee, Juan Llanos, on its speaker list. It sounds like some lively speeches were had, too. In the opening keynote, Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne reportedly drew on references to Marx, Engels and the more contemporary U.S. scholar Francis Fukuyama to explain why he\u2019s jazzed about the \u201ccrypto revolution.\u201d In a somewhat more sober presentation, Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen warned that transaction blocks in bitcoin\u2019s core ledger would need to dramatically increase in size to avoid transaction fees rising \u201cto the point where only rich people can transact\u201d in bitcoin, according to Coindesk\u2019s report. Meanwhile, even when it\u2019s in the midst of a big industry celebration such as this conference, it seems the Bitcoin Foundation is unable to avoid all controversy.

(Michael Casey) - As newspapermen ourselves, we take special interest in the things that the group over at the Chicago Sun-Times is doing with cryptocurrencies. The paper started accepting bitcoin for subscriptions in April, and as they promised they are continuing to experiment. The paper plans to run ads with printed QR codes, allowing readers to use bitcoin to buy products directly. The first test of this is planned in conjunction with a local ticket exchange for tickets to a Jay-Z/Beyonce show at Soldier Field this summer. \u201cThe implications of this are pretty massive we feel,\u201d Josh Metnick, the chief technology officer at parent company Wrapports, told us via email. \u201cIt will allow newspapers or any printed media, for the first time we are aware of, the ability to transact directly with customers, to allow newspaper advertisers the ability to sell directly to consumers reading the paper.\u201d Also, the paper, which started accepting bitcoin earlier this year, will expand the digital currencies it accepts, adding litecoin, dogecoin, and peercoin. \u201cWe are not stopping at bitcoin.\u201d The third experiment \u2014 and it is exactly that, an experiment \u2014 will involve using dogecoin as a conduit for tipping journalists on specific articles. Mr. Metnick said they\u2019re going to move slowly \u2014 the initial trial may simply involve the tips going to a given journalist\u2019s preferred charity. He acknowledged there were \u201ceditorial ethics\u201d involved, but he feels dogecoin tipping is becoming \u201cthe new like,\u201d and somewhere down the road this might even comprise a \u201cfundamental business model change.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - A nudist colony in Canada accepts bitcoin.

The membership cancelations were led by Patrick Alexander, who posted on the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s forum calling on others to follow his lead and \u201cresign as an individual member.\u201d Mr. Alexander wrote that he was prompted to act by the election of bitcoin entrepreneur Brock Pierce, to the foundation\u2019s industry board. Alongside two others, Mr. Pierce\xa0was in 2000 accused by three former employees of his first company, Digital Entertainment Lawsuits, of pressuring them into sex when they were young teenagers. \xa0The lawsuits were dropped and Mr. Pierce was never charged with a crime. Mr. Pierce, a one-time Disney child movie star and an investor in various digital startups who is now leading an investor effort to revive failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. However, he has frequently denied the allegations in the past. In a video produced this week by BitcoinMediaProject.com, Mr. Pierce is shown saying the charges against him have \u201cbeen publicly out there for age and ages and none of it is true. None of my partners, none of my investors, none of my friends have an issue with it.\u201d Reached via email at the Bitcoin Foundation conference, the organization\u2019s spokeswoman, Jinyoung Englund, confirmed that \u201conly about 10\u201d people had canceled their membership out of total of more than 1,500 members.\xa0 She said such individual members can\u2019t \u201cresign\u201d per se, as they are not elected and don\u2019t hold official titles. In his forum post, Mr. Alexander noted that Mr. Pierce\u2019s appointment followed the resignations from the same industry board of Charlie Shrem, who was arrested in January on money laundering charges, and Mark Karpeles, the Chief Executive Officer of Mt. Gox, which declared bankruptcy on Feb. 28 and claims to have lost 650,000 bitcoins, worth about $289 million at current prices. \u201cThe foundation members need to emulate very high moral values and ethics in business and in personal dealings, especially as it involves money,\u201d Mr. Alexander wrote. \u201cI no longer want to be associated with these people.\u201d But other members came to Mr. Pierce\u2019s defense.\xa0 Jacob Eliosoff, a prominent member of the bitcoin community, \xa0wrote in the forum thread\xa0initiated by Mr. Alexander that Mr. Pierce was \xa0\u201cnever brought to trial [and] as far as I can tell never directly accused of anything in or out of court. Mr. Eliosoff, who last year left a job as programmer at Goldman Sachs to work on his own bitcoin startup, confirmed his comments in a telephone interview and said he was concerned that the \u201cconversation has been misdirected\u201d away from \u201csubstantive discussions\u201d about Mr. Pierce\u2019s contributions to bitcoin by a debate over \u201ctangential issues that are far back in time.\u201d One of the more vocal critics of Mr. Pierce is bitcoin investor Olivier Janssens, who also posted on the forum that he was \u201cresigning as a lifetime member.\u201d Reached at the same conference in Amsterdam, Mr. Janssens said the Foundation \u201cshould be learning from this\u201d and \u201cshould have a good character test in place.\u201d He also complained that voting for industry board members was limited to industry members, which number around 100. If it were to widen elections to the full list, he argued, \u201cYou would get more people doing research on the candidates.\u201d In response, Ms. Englund\xa0 said \u201cthe election was an open, democratic and transparent process.\u201d She added, \u201c[f]rom the beginning, it was clear that industry board seats could only be filled through a vote by the industry member base [whereas] individual seats are voted on by individual members.\u201d She said the current bylaws allow members to suggest changes to the voting process. According to the foundation\u2019s web site, individuals can obtain annual membership for $25 and a lifetime membership for $100. There are three tiers of industry membership, ranging from \u201csilver\u201d \xa0with dues of $1,000 for companies of less than25 employees to \u201cplatinum\u201d at $100,000. Mr. Janssen has had differences with Mr. Pierce since before the election, primarily over the latter\u2019s bid to rehabilitate Mt. Gox. Mr. Janssen, who is one of more than 100,000 former customers with claims on Mt. Gox and who organized a creditor action group, favors liquidating the failed exchange rather than the takeover proposed by Mr. Pierce\u2019s consortium, known as Sunlot Holdings. He takes issue with Sunlot\u2019s offer of just one bitcoin for Mt. Gox.\xa0 \u201cThis is just leeches trying to get it for free,\u201d Mr. Janssens said. \u201cThere should be some value up top to show they are serious.\u201d Mr. Pierce and Sunlot CEO John Betts have previously argued that the token low price reflects the fact that it\u2019s impossible to put a value on Mt.

His Circle Internet Financial has been ranging around, raising money and making plans. But until Friday, nobody knew exactly what it would do. They know now. Mr. Allaire unveiled the first product at the Bitcoin 2014 conference in Amsterdam, a free service aimed at general consumers that will allow \xa0them to seamlessly import traditional currency from a linked bank account and convert it into a Circle bitcoin account with which they can send and receive money. Accounts will hold bitcoin but will be quoted in users\u2019 home currency at prevailing bitcoin exchange rates and can be instantly cashed back into those currencies via their bank accounts. There\u2019s a heavy emphasis on security and on Circle\u2019s role as a\xa0trusted\xa0custodian of its customers\u2019 assets. Circle\u2019s service will have a \u201cgeneral orientation, it won\u2019t be focused on bitcoin per se,\u201d Mr. Allaire told MoneyBeat earlier this week. The idea, he explained, is to ground the service around \u201cthings people understand,\u201d like the U.S. dollar. The service will attract bitcoin enthusiasts, he expects, but he\u2019s looking to attract people \u201cwho don\u2019t think in bitcoin,\u201d but do have an active digital life. He expects it will attract a lot of younger users, people who spend a lot of time online already. It\u2019s an interesting proposition. Circle will mimic features of some bitcoin wallet and payment processing services, like those from Coinbase and Blockchain, but it will also mimic some of the deposit-providing and custodial features of traditional banks (though it is not a traditional bank). Essentially, the company is looking to operate in a gap between the bitcoin-savvy world and the traditional world. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of direct competitors,\u201d he said. Under a purist vision for bitcoin, individuals are expected to download their own digital wallet and operate it essentially as their own personal bitcoin bank relying on trusted entities to manage their funds and transactions. Firms like blockchain.info worked off that model by offering customized wallets with easy interfaces that otherwise left responsibility for securing it with the customer. Blockchain competitor Coinbase shifted the model by taking responsibility for storing the critical \u201cprivate key\u201d needed to unlock a wallet\u2019s contents. \xa0Circle is taking that one step further, assuming full digital custodian status. To fulfill that, the company says, it has invested in military-grade hardware, sophisticated multiple-signature architecture for authorizing transactions and cold-storage wallets. It will also provide customers with free insurance from theft. Mr. Allaire is a well-known entrepreneur. He created the development language ColdFusion, and was chief technology officer at Macromedia. He later founded and was CEO of Brightcove, leaving there in 2013 to focus on Circle. How he would set himself up in the bitcoin world has been something of a parlor game, with purists wary of his \u201cmainstream\u201d leanings. He isn\u2019t worried, however, about the reception from the bitcoin community. He expects the reception will be \u201cpretty positive, actually.\u201d The service will be offered free of any charges, Mr. Allaire said, and the company at this stage isn\u2019t looking to turn a profit on it. All customer money will be held in reserve (though not in segregated accounts), and the business is regulated as a money transmitter. \u201cWe can\u2019t invest customer money,\u201d Mr. Allaire said. His goal with this initial product, he said, is to move bitcoin\u2019s value from the speculative to the utilitarian. \u201cWe want to encourage consumer adoption,\u201d he said. The company has several ideas for paid products that it can offer down the line, and with about $26 million in venture capital, \u201cwe have a lot of runway\u201d to absorb the costs of this initial product. The service will also help customers keep track of their bitcoin holdings, in order to comply with the IRS guidance issued this year that ruled bitcoin a commodity and subject to capital-gains taxes. Initially, the service will be offered via invite-only, and expanded over time.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/05/16/jeremy-allaires-bitcoin-start-up-circle-unveils-first-product/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 5, 16, 0, 0), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Jeremy Allaire&rsquo;s Bitcoin Start-Up, Circle, Unveils First Product'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $443.10, up 0.31% (via CoinDesk) \u2013If individuals and businesses could use a bitcoin-based infrastructure to make and receive payments denominated in dollars, euros, or yen with zero fees and without bitcoin\u2019s notorious exchange rate risk, would they take it? That rather simple proposition is the driving force behind BitReserve, the latest startup to use bitcoin\u2019s technological advances to lower the costs of payments while downplaying its use as a currency.\xa0 Launched Thursday in an invites-only beta version, BitReserve differs from most other bitcoin payment businesses, however, in that peer-to-peer transactions can occur within its network as if only traditional currencies are being exchanged. \u201cThe idea that bitcoin itself could be so volatile and become money is almost an impossibility,\u201d said founder and\xa0Executive Chairman Halsey Minor, the entrepreneur behind news service CNet and other early Internet platform, in a presentation to the media earlier Thursday. As such, Bitreserve allows \u201cmembers to convert bitcoin into money they know, trust, and understand,\u201d he said. That\u2019s done via \u201cbitcurrencies,\u201d \xa0digital stores of value that can represent either dollars, euros, yuan, yen or pounds and are which are lodged in sub-accounts held in the customer\u2019s name. Underlying this arrangement is the core transaction-verifying infrastructure of the bitcoin network, known as the blockchain, which is used to confirm ownership of the bitcurrencies in each account whenever they are transferred. Unlike the bitcoin-storing wallets offered by firms such as Coinbase, Blockchain.info or Bitgo, the value as expressed in these fiat currencies won\u2019t fluctuate, something BitReserve claims it can guarantee because the accumulated digital \u201cbitcurrency\u201d value will be backed by a full reserve of real-world currencies. By exploiting BitReserve\u2019s status as a centralized, cloud-based institution with no third-party intermediaries, account holders will be able to instantly transfer value to others operating within its proprietary network. They can transfer funds within the same currencies, into accounts denominated in other traditional currencies, or into bitcoin. Transfers within the same currency incur no fees at all. BitReserve hopes this will entice online merchants to join its network in the hope that individual BitReserve members will pay them in bitcurrencies and so avoid the 3% transaction fees that merchants typically bear from credit card transactions. Transfers that involve traditional currency exchanges incur a 2.7% fee above the wholesale exchange rate, and those into bitcoin cost around 1.3%. Those rates are more favorable than the \u201cspread\u201d that\u2019s typically charged to retail customers in foreign-exchange transactions. In conjunction with this model, BitReserve says it will also publish and constantly update an accounting of the assets and liabilities, using the traceable features of the bitcoin blockchain, to create \u201ca public, real-time, traceable proof of solvency.\u201d In addition to making money from foreign exchange trading, BitReserve intends to invest the reserves that it accumulates to back up the funds held by its members.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $444.79, up 1.5% (via CoinDesk) - eBay CEO John Donahoe makes some supportive comments about digital currency at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. Toward the end of the meeting, during a Q&A session, Mr. Donahoe was asked about bitcoin and how eBay might utilize it. He chuckled, and said \u201cwe could spend a couple of days talking about bitcoin.\u201d He then gave his own take on it, characterizing it as \u201ca new, exciting and emerging technology.\u201d \u201cWe think bitcoin will play a very important role in the future,\u201d he said.

But eBay\u2019s had an odd flirtation with bitcoin for a while now, fueling speculation about it jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. These latest comments will only fuel that expectation. (Paul Vigna) \u2013For anyone relatively new to bitcoin, the recent price activity has had a comforting, stable feel to it. Since April 27, the price of bitcoin hasn\u2019t strayed below $418.11 or above $459.71 on an intraday basis, according to Coindesk\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index. If you go out to March 28, the range gets somewhat wider \u2014 $344.24 to $543.48 \u2013 but over that one-and-a-half-month time frame the chart is still oscillating around $440. Such volatility would be remarkable for most other financial instruments. But this is bitcoin, which soared more than 1,000% to a peak of $1,165 over final two months of 2013\xa0and which then lost 70% of its value over the next four months. By those standards, April and May have been boring. So, is this the New Normal for bitcoin? Not necessarily. Not if bitcoin\u2019s short history is to be taken as a lesson. Greg Schvey, a partner at TradeBlock, which provides analytical and trading tools for investors in digital currencies, notes there have been frequent and relatively long periods of stability severed by periods of extreme price swings. The price was volatile in the spring of 2013 amid the Cyprus banking crisis, then flattened in the summer, and then rose exponentially in the fall. So, this current trend \u201cisn\u2019t really anything that is going to be indicative,\u201d Mr Schvey said. He also says the price chart shows bitcoin currently at the convergence of key resistance and support lines, the first descending from the December peak, the latter sitting around $400, which is more or less the level to which it has dipped periodically since early November.\xa0 Traditional technical analysis suggests the price is poised for either an upside or downside breakout through those lines. Certainly, the fact that a spate of bad news has subsided is supportive of the price. But although payments processor Bitpay\u2019s $30 million fund-raising this week could encourage more bitcoin adoption by merchants and customers over time, and so boost the price, Mr. Schvey believes the net effect of big processing activity could for now have a depressing effect. That\u2019s because merchants typically want to be compensated in dollars, which means Bitpay and its like are left with excess coins to dump on the market. Other price supporting factors to watch include the buildout of exchanges and financial instruments that allow big players to enter what is still a low-volume market without having the price move against them, and the future arrival of new bitcoin exchange-traded vehicles, such as that being developed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $435.49, down 0.7% (via CoinDesk) \u2013When payment processor Bitpay announced the biggest-ever funding round for a bitcoin company earlier Tuesday it was was Richard Branson\u2019s presence in the investment group that drew the most attention. But while the Virgin Group chairman\u2019s remarks about Bitpay leading a \u201ccurrency revolution\u201d were lapped up by bitcoin enthuisasts, we thought the comments from some of the lesser known investors were as, if not more, illuminating. They helped frame what might be called the emerging venture-capitalist vision for bitcoin: That its promise lies in disrupting an antiquated, inefficient and expensive global payments system more than as a revolutionary challenger to traditional currencies. Jan Hammer, a partner at London-based Index Ventures, which led the funding round, says his firm is ignoring the question of bitcoin\u2019s value as an asset and instead investing in bitcoin \u201cas a method for payments over the Internet.\u201d Index Ventures, he said, \u201cis agnostic about the price of bitcoin.\u201d For his part, Gardiner Garrard, managing partner at Atlanta-based TTV Capital, another one of the new Bitpay investors, sees bitcoin as an extension of a 60-year cycle of technological development that began with the advent of the information technology revolution some 40 years ago. Following the precepts of scholar Carlota Perez, who writes about technology, financial bubbles and economic development, Mr. Garrard sees the emergence of bitcoin and related applications as part of what Ms. Perez would deem the \u201cgolden age\u201d\xa0 phase of a 60-year process over which the world\u2019s information technology infrastructure has developed. This, Mr. Garrard said, is the moment where people \u201care no longer making money building out the base technology infrastructure [of the Internet], which happens in the first 30 years, but is more about what you build upon it to modernize pre-existing industries.\u201d And for Mr. Garrard, an industry that\u2019s especially \u201cripe for disruption\u201d is the payments \u201cecosystem,\u201d in which his own firm, as a specialist investor in financial technology companies, is concentrated.\xa0 \u201cA lot of wealth is going to be built in this last part of the cycle\u201d by companies that \u201cleverage this installed infrastructure,\u201d he said. The other big takeaway from our conversations with these VCs and with Bitpay CEO Anthony Gallippi is how much they are focused on what many see as the real big bitcoin opportunity: enabling cheap, safe electronic payments for the \u201cunbanked\u201d of the world. \u201cIn the developing world, banks only serve 10% of the population, so bitcoin has a huge opportunity because it works on any Android device, or Apple iPhone and even a Windows phone,\u201d Mr. Gallippi said. \u201cThose countries may not have a huge banking infrastructure, but they all have mobile phones.\u201d As Index Ventures\u2019 Mr. Hammer puts it, independent digital currency-based payment\xa0 systems have the capacity to reach these people because they aren\u2019t beholden to the different national systems that define the current bank-centric payments model. \u201cBitcoin is global, built on an open-source protocol and so is democratic and open to all,\u201d he said. (Michael Casey) - The \u201cBitcoin Embassy\u201d is open for business in Warsaw. Mateusz Kocol attended an opening ceremony on Monday, and wrote about it for the Polish website bitcoinet\xa0(the link is to a translated page). The embassy, to our eyes, is similar to the Bitcoin Center in downtown Manhattan, and it joins \u201cembassies\u201d in Montreal\xa0and Tel Aviv. It\u2019s essentially an education and community center, located on a commercial street in central Warsaw. But the idea is to have a meeting place for enthusiasts, and a physical space where the curious can learn more.

(Paul Vigna) - Another bitcoin mining company is going into the clouds. CoinTerra announced it will begin selling cloud-based mining contracts. The mining game has become an accelerating spiral of higher costs for more powerful computing power, at the same time that lower bitcoin prices are yielding smaller returns. That\u2019s squeezing the industry. To get an idea of the size of mining capacity right now, consider that CoinTerra is now selling contracts that provide for 1 petahash/second of mining capacity. Eight months ago, in September, bitcoin mining hit 1 petahash for the entire industry \u2013 and that was 40 times the size of mining capacity at the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin is down about 60% since December. In that environment, it\u2019s become very hard to your typical plucky individual who wants to make some easy money to mine on their own. This arms race was inevitable, though, and none other than Satoshi Nakamoto himself foresaw it. In 2009 when bitcoin was in its infancy, he pushed to delay the introduction of graphics cards into mining, calling for a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to limit power to desktop computing. \u201cIt\u2019s nice how anyone with just a CPU can compete fairly equally right now,\u201d he wrote in December 2009.\xa0(Paul Vigna) - If you\u2019ve already read this far, chances are you\u2019re already familiar with digital currencies.

CoinTerra on Monday announced that it will begin offering cloud-based mining services to its customers, becoming the second big miner this month to make the move. As the price of bitcoin has tumbled, it has become increasingly difficult to profitably mine bitcoin, a problem for the miners and the companies catering to them. As more miners come aboard, the bitcoin algorithm automatically adjusts its difficultly higher. This has sparked an arms race, with miners deploying increasingly powerful computers to stay on top. That has led to a rising spiral of costs. It\u2019s reached the point where it\u2019s become cost-prohibitive for people to mine on their own. Cloud mining, where miners buy contracts from companies like CoinTerra and PeerNova, is emerging as a cheaper option. CoinTerra, founded nearly a year ago, \xa0will be selling one- and two-year contracts for a range of mining power, from 200 gigahash (small) up to one petahash (big), as well as continuing to sell mining rigs. \u201cWe\u2019re catering to basically the entire spectrum out there,\u201d CEO Ravi Iyengar told BitBeat. Through the mining rigs it sells, CoinTerra comprises about 15% of the total mining output, the company said, and it expects to maintain that market share. As bitcoin has grown, the\u201dhash rate,\u201d a measurement of mining power, has skyrocketed.\xa0In September 2013,\xa0the entire mining network reached the 1 petahash/second rate, a multiple of 40 times higher than in January 2013. Now CoinTerra will be selling 1 petahash contracts. It\u2019s gotten so big, it\u2019s harder to mine profitably on anything but a very large scale. CoinTerra itself saw sales drop 30% in April. Thus the move into cloud mining. In the early days of the cryptocurrency, it was possible to mine using desktop computers. As it grew, CPUs gave way to graphics cards, which gave way to generic chips modified for mining, which gave way to chips programmed for a single task called ASICs. It now takes machines with multiple dedicated chips to mine profitably, and increasingly even that kind of computing power doesn\u2019t provide a sufficient return on the investment, given the falling price of bitcoins, the increasing size of the mining community, and the concurrent increasing energy demands, which has emerged as a major roadblock. \u201cSpace and power is a big issue,\u201d Mr. Iyengar told BitBeat. \u201cThe power required is unlike any other server industry.\u201d CoinTerra is leasing space at several data centers in the U.S., he said, and has some plans to build its own data center. The upheaval has resulted in a string of problems for the industry, from bankruptcies to delivery delays to lawsuits. KnCMiner has had problems with deliveries, and branched out into selling rigs that mine for altcoins rather than bitcoin. Butterfly Labs is involved in several lawsuits, and a startup called HashFast Technologies (which is also involved in a lawsuit) on Monday announced that it laid off 50% of its staff. Washington-based Alydian simply went bankrupt as the cloud-based mining business it built couldn\u2019t keep up with the increasing power demands. \u201cA lot of people got into this space in the mad gold rush,\u201d Mr. Iyengar said, \u201chere you\u2019re trying to combine hardware and software and the whole supply chain associated with a server market.\u201d He likened it to trying to combine Intel, Microsoft, and Dell. The total computing power is rising at such an exponential rate, that machines have a short productive lifespan. Even a delay of a month or two between the time a customer places an order and the time the machine arrives can severely cut into profits. Thus the move into the cloud.

Bobby Lee, CEO of digital-currency exchange BTC China, was elected to one of two vacant seats on the Foundation after\xa0a three-way run-off vote concluded late Thursday. The other seat went to Brock Pierce, chairman of payment processor GoCoin, who has invested widely across the bitcoin industry \u2013 including in BTC China \u2013 and is now leading a team seeking to take over and revive bankrupt exchange Mt. Gox. Voting was close, with Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham earning 63% of the 71 votes cast to come in just behind Mr. Pierce, who earned 65% and Mr. Lee, with 79%. The empty seats are the legacy of two of bitcoin\u2019s more controversial moments this year. The first was vacated by Charles Shrem, the Foundation\u2019s former vice chairman, who was arrested in late January on charges of helping drug dealers launder money, and the second by Mark Karpelese, the former CEO of Mt. Gox, which declared bankruptcy on Feb. 28, when it announced that it had lost 850,000 bitcoins, a pool that was worth around $500 million at the time. The Foundation has no direct authority over the bitcoin industry but it functions as a key liaison with government regulators and the general public. As part of that outreach, it recently hired Jim Harper, a senior fellow at Washington think tank the Cato Institute to work as global policy counsel in helping the lobbying effort to shape favorable regulation for the fledgling digital currency. The Foundation\u2019s staff also includes board member Gavin Andresen, who bears the title of chief scientist and manages a team of five core developers responsible for coordinating the development and upkeep of bitcoin\u2019s central software.

Gox got a boost from a Chicago judge Thursday. U.S. District Court \xa0Judge Gary Feinerman gave his preliminary approval to a\xa0settlement \xa0between class-action lawyers representing U.S. creditors of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox and the Sunlot consortium, which is led by bitcoin entrepeneur Brock Pierce and venture capital investors William Quigley and Matthew Roszak. The parties to the deal will now seek the approval of the\xa0Japanese trustee and administrative court overseeing the bankruptcy. Sunlot was not a defendant in the initial lawsuit. However, by negotiating a deal with Jay Edelson, the class action lawyer, which included commitments of support from \xa0two of the original defendants, Mt. Gox founder Jed McCaleb and former marketing director\xa0Gonzague Gay-Bouchery, the consortium found a legal avenue to pursue its complicated takeover bid. Under the settlement terms, creditors would obtain a 16.5% stake in the newly revived Mt. Gox. The approval means the plaintiff class is now fully certified. But getting approval in Japan, where liquidation proceedings have already begun, could still be a major hurdle. If it does get the all-clear from Tokyo, Sunlot would be free to take control of Mt. Gox. However, creditors covered by the lawsuit class would still have an opportunity to opt out of the settlement and continue suing for the recovery of their lost bitcoins. \xa0(Michael Casey) - The Federal Election Commission gave the green light Thursday to political donations in bitcoin of up to $100 per election cycle. What was left unclear by the perennially divided six-person body was whether it also gave bitcoin donors freedom to give more than that. Read our take on that here. Either way, the ambiguity isn\u2019t holding back Congressman Jared Polis (D., Colo.), a Washigton friend to bitcoin if there ever was one. On Thursday, he opened his website to accept bitcoin donations and, for good measure, converted the \u201cO\u201d in his name as it appears on the donations page into the bitcoin \u201cB\u201d symbol. This is the same Jared Polis who responded to his Democratic colleague \xa0Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s (D., Va.) recent \xa0call to to outlaw bitcoin with a parody letter calling for a ban on the U.S. dollar.  In fact, there are already 17 political campaigns and political action committees accepting bitcoin, according to Make Your Laws, the PAC that made the request to the FEC that led to Thursday\u2019s advisory. Make \xa0Your Laws, which is a non-partisan group working to reform campaign finance, sought FEC guidance as a way to bring clarity to the bitcoin donation question. One bitcoin-accepting PACs that caught our attention was BitPAC, which has the explicit goal of raising money to contribute to bitcoin-friendly politicians. We\u2019re not sure how easily this feature of BitPAC\u2019s web site would pass muster with the FEC\u2019s strict disclosure rules, however:\xa0At the donation page, you\u2019re met with a form to fill in your details but if you ignore that and click on the \u201cBitcoin: Donate now\u201d button at the bottom of the page, it takes you straight to an address to which you can send coins without having to enter your name and details. (Michael Casey) \xa0 - We\u2019re not sure what to even make of this, but it must be reported: there is a bitcoin game show. It\u2019s called \u201cTake My Bitcoins,\u201d it airs on the web every Thursday night at 11 p.m. ET, and it\u2019s, well, it\u2019s pretty much what you\u2019d expect: call-in contestants play a variety of games, and get rewarded with bitcoins for winning. One interesting thing is how the show comes by the bitcoin it gives away: it mines them, using mining equipment supplied by Butterfly Labs, which also happens to sponsor the show. Which means the show is really an online throwback to the early days of television, when programs like \u201cAdmiral Broadway Revue,\u201d \u201cYour Show of Shows,\u201d and the soap operas had set sponsorships in place. It makes for an interest piece of marketing. Butterfly Labs is currently involved in two lawsuits with customers who claims they never got the equipment they purchased. Several mining companies, in fact, are grappling with similar complaints, as the nascent industry is going through a relatively painful teething stage. The show is hosted by Mike Rotman, a TV and film producer and writer, and guests include relatively well known actors like Samm Levine, Jill-Michele Melean, and Illeana Douglas. The show\u2019s got a goofy quality to it, the production values skew toward the public-access cable side of the television spectrum (if you remember the old Uncle Floyd Show,\xa0you know what we mean). One game, called This or That, requires contestants to answer whether, for instance, Pol Pot was a dictator or a cookie, and whether \u201cBorg\u201d is a breed of cat or a species on Star Trek.

The question now is how much is allowed. In a six-zero decision, the FEC approved a political action committee\u2018s request that it be allowed to accept up to $100 worth of bitcoins from a single contributor per election cycle.\xa0 Make Your Laws, a non-partisan PAC focused on campaign finance reform, made the request in part to try to establish clear guidelines for how to legally treat bitcoin donations. Like all such FEC advisories,\xa0this one\xa0was simply ruling on the merits of the particular request and was agnostic on cases outside the specific scenario described by Make Your Laws. But depending on who you listen to within the Commission, which is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, the ruling either gives politicians carte blanche to accept more than $100 per election cycle \u2013 or left that question undecided. For his part, FEC Chairman Lee Goodman, a Virginia Republican, said in\xa0a separate statement\xa0that Thursday\u2019s advisory opinion \u201cin no way establishes the outer boundary for the contributions and use of bitcoins.\u201d \xa0In an interview, he argued that the ruling effectively recognized incoming bitcoins as \u201cin-kind\u201d donations and not as cash, which implied that bitcoins are exempt from laws limiting cash-only contributions to $100. \u201cThe underlying premise of this advisory is quite libertarian in permitting the use of bitcoins,\u201d said Mr. Goodman. As with \u201cbonds, securities, barter credit units\u2026and works of art,\u201d it means that bitcoin contributions are now \u201cby default\u201d permitted for up to $2,600 per campaign per year, $5,000 per PAC, $10,000 for state or local committees and $97,200 for national party committees, so long as recipients comply with disclosure and identification rules. But Vice Chairwoman Ann M. Ravel, a Democrat from California, completely refuted Mr. Goodman\u2019s interpretation. \u201cThere was never any understanding that this would be treated as either cash or in-kind,\u201d she said, calling for a more far-reaching rule-making session to firmly establish some of these unresolved principles. The different readings appear to hinge on two potentially contradictory aspects of Thursday\u2019s advisory. Firstly, the Commission said Make Your Laws was exempt from requirements that it convert incoming bitcoins into cash and deposit that cash into its official campaign depository within 10 days. Since this is the same exemption that applies to other in-kind contributions such as stocks, bonds and art objects, Make Your Laws founder Sai (who only has one name) suggested the commissioners \u201care leaning toward treating bitcoins as in-kind contributions.\u201d But the advisory does not explicitly define bitcoins as \u201cin-kind\u201d and also formally requires Make Your Laws to convert into cash any bitcoins that it purchases. Meanwhile, the Commission was split three-to-three over Make Your Laws\u2019 request that it be allowed to acquire goods and services with bitcoins, a form of in-kind transaction. Vice Chairwoman Ravel characterized Mr. Goodman\u2019s claim that this was a \u201cdefault\u201d ruling in favor of more generous limits for bitcoin donors as a breach of the Commission\u2019s principles. \u201cIf that were so, then those of who have voted to approve something\u2026might as well not exist,\u201d she said. \u201cI can go home to California and never vote.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $442.43, up 3.6% (via CoinDesk) - VC money continues to flow into bitcoin businesses.\xa0Vaurum, a firm that develops bitcoin-exchange software for financial institutions, raised $4 million in seed funding from Battery Ventures and investors including former AOL CEO Steve Case and Tim Draper, co-founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Essentially, Vaurum builds software that allows financial firms to host their own bitcoin exchanges. Our colleagues over at the Venture Capital blog covered the story earlier on Wednesday. Vaurum\xa0didn\u2019t disclose the names of the firms to which it has sold software (we asked) \u2013 or for that matter if it\u2019s sold any of its software \u2013 but there has been a lot of chatter \xa0about Wall Street and digital currencies recently. It comes after last week\u2019s news that Bloomberg was starting to publish bitcoin pricing data on its terminals, and it\u2019s one more sign that Wall Street is getting serious about digital currencies. More and more money is flowing into the field. The numbers are small by the standards of the wider capital markets, but significant for the cryptoworld. There were 40 deals in 2013 that raised a total of $74 million, including a $25 million round of fund-raising in December by Coinbase (the single biggest deal).\xa0That number will almost certainly rise: apart from the Vaurum deal, an Australian venture-capital fund, Future Capital, announced plans for a $30 million fund specifically aimed at bitcoin businesses. (Paul Vigna) - An alert by the Securities and Exchange Commission says investors should treat certain bitcoin investment pitches like small-cap pump-and-dump schemes featured in the movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d \u2014 especially if they offer guaranteed high returns. In an investor alert Wednesday, the SEC told investors the rise of bitcoin and other cybercurrencies \u201ccreates new concerns,\u201d including \u201cthe potential to giver rise both to frauds and high-risk investment opportunities.\u201d Investors should particularly be on the lookout for pie-in-the-sky return guarantees, the SEC said. The reason: They don\u2019t exist. \u201cThere is no such thing as guaranteed high investment returns,\u201d the alert said. Investors should also be wary of unsolicited offers to invest in a bitcoin scheme, unlicensed sellers and \u201cpressure to buy RIGHT NOW.\u201d Of course, such advice applies to any investment, not just bitcoin. It\u2019s not the first time the SEC has issued a bitcoin alert. The agency previously warned investors to be on the lookout for Ponzi schemes based on virtual currencies such as bitcoin. \u201cWe are concerned that the rising use of virtual currencies in the global marketplace may entice fraudsters to lure investors into Ponzi and other schemes in which these currencies are used to facilitate fraudulent, or simply fabricated, investments and transactions,\u201d the SEC said. The Financial Industry Regulators Authority has also warned investors to be wary of bitcoin. In an alert the punsters at Finra called \u201cBitcoin: More than a Bit Risky,\u201d investors were cautioned that there is a \u201crisk of fraud related to companies claiming to offer bitcoin payment and other bitcoin-related products and services.\u201d (Scott Patterson) - We mentioned last week that we\u2019d come across almost enough bitcoin-related music to put out an EP (google it, Mouseketeers). Well, it didn\u2019t take long for the community help us out: meet Tatiana Moroz and her song, \u201cThe Bitcoin Jingle.\u201d Why do we keep collecting these songs? They\u2019re an illustration that this whole bitcoin movement is about more than a technology; that it\u2019s a cultural movement as well.

Coinbase announced that it acquired Kippt, a start-up company whose product gives users with a way to store and sort online media. Terms of the deal, paid in a combination of cash and stock, were not disclosed. Kippt\u2019s two-person team of Jori Lallo and Karri Saarinen will be joining Coinbase. Right about now you might be wondering why a bitcoin-services companies bought a start-up that has nothing to do with bitcoin, or digital currencies. We were. One reason is familiarity. Kippt\u2019s Lallo and Saarinen started their company two years ago through seed-funding from Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley endeavor to boost young companies. That\u2019s when they met Brian Armstrong, who was there at the same time starting up Coinbase. Another reasons is, Lallo and Saarinen explained in a blog post, that Kippt never reached the scale necessary to give it a future, one reason they\u2019re moving over to Coinbase. While Coinbase is bringing on two developers it knows, the company also plans to use the Kippt platform in Coinbase products, we were told. It will be interesting to see how Coinbase incorporates Kippt\u2019s aesthetic, and how they use that to expand the bitcoin business.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $429.24, down 1.1% (via CoinDesk) - Much Vroom, dogecar.\xa0Dogecoin, the altcoin created just six months ago, scored a major PR coup on Sunday, when Nascar driver Josh Wise piloted his #98 Moonrocket Ford on the track at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama in the Aaron\u2019s 499. How? Dogecoin users on reddit funded and purchased a sponsorship for the car (pictured above), giving the upstart cryptocurrency a level of visibility usually reserved for major corporate sponsors. For $55,000, the cost of the sponsorship, the dogies got their beloved shiba inu dog, the symbol of dogecoin, on national TV in front of millions of Nascar fans for several hours.\xa0Dogecoin was created in December, and has attracted a loyal, energetic, and as Sunday proved, creative group of supporters. MoneyBeat was especially impressed when Fox\u2019s Mike Joy explained what the winner of the race would receive \u2013 in dogecoin: \u201ca win here would pay 596 million, \xa0644 thousand, 147 dogecoins.\u201d This post on Deadspin has a video of the mention, when Wise pulled into the pits. Of course, this inspired the dogies to do their thing, which included basically taking over the reddit page on Nascar, and photoshoping grammatically imperfect sayings in the comic sans font onto a picture, in this case, of the car: Obligatory #DogeCoin Tweet. #NASCAR @TheOrangeCone @nascarcasm @HigNASCAR @Josh_Wise pic.twitter.com/SGEjD2WAOS \u2014 Peter Leung (@BaronVonClutch) May 4, 2014 It also led to some funny moments in the real world, too, as sports fans tried to figure out exactly what is a dogecoin.

We happened upon an ad for Overstock as well that, in the final title screen, had the words \u201cnow accepting bitcoin.\u201d) (Paul Vigna) - Ripple Labs, which promotes an intriguing, well-funded bitcoin-like platform for electronic payments with existing currencies, has taken an important early step toward viability: It signed up a bank to use its services. Getting Germany\u2019s Fidor bank to agree to use Ripple for fund transfers is not quite as earth-shattering as, say, signing on a few big Wall Street banks. Fidor\u2019s a relatively small player within Germany. But it\u2019s an early convert to digital currencies, providing banking services for bitcoin exchanges such as San Francisco-based Kraken. What Fidor can do with the platform has the potential to significantly lower the costs and time lags involved in sending payments through the banking system. According to a Ripple statement, Fidor will use the peer-to-peer platform for both interbank transactions and intra-bank transfers with its own subsidiaries overseas, bypassing a host of intermediaries in the process. This, Ripple and Fidor claim, will allow the bank\u2019s customers to send money to recipients anywhere at markedly lower rates. \u201cRight off the bat they can rapidly and cheaply move value to other gateways that they\u2019ve vetted and that they trust,\u201d Ripple CEO Chris Larsen said of Fidor. A traditional transfer of, say, dollars to euros from a U.S. bank to a German bank, involves two central banks and two intermediary foreign exchange trading banks, all of which incurs fees or foreign exchange \u201cspread\u201d costs. The transaction will take from one to five days to be settled. By contrast, a transaction on the Ripple network takes just six seconds to be confirmed with no risk of charge-backs or cancellations, the company says. It involves only the initiating and receiving institutions, while if there\u2019s need for a foreign exchange component it is set by network-based market-makers who compete transparently to offer the best price. Ripple is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. Some in the bitcoin community don\u2019t like that it is a for-profit company, unlike bitcoin (which of course isn\u2019t a company at all). But Ripple executives say the Wall Street banks and other entities that they\u2019re pitching to don\u2019t care about this distinction. Ripple has so far raised $6.5 million in financing from some high-profile names in venture capital, including Andreesen Horowitz, Google Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

The former Treasury Secretary isn\u2019t fully endorsing digital currencies, but he has taken a hard look at them and sees huge potential to strip out costs from an inefficient, cumbersome global financial system. This viewpoint from one of the world\u2019s most influential economic thinkers contrasts starkly with those of skeptics such as New York University\u2019s Nouriel Roubini, who has called bitcoin a \u201cponzi scheme,\u201d and lawmakers such as Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) , who says it anonymity is \u201cdangerous\u201d and has said it should be banned. The starting point for Mr. Summers\u2019 argument, laid out in an in-depth phone interview, is that the financial system is fraught with \u201csubstantial inefficiency.\u201d That system already depends heavily on information technology, and yet \u201cit has not been disrupted as the distribution of books or clothing has been\u201d disrupted by that technology. That makes finance now \u201cripe for disruption,\u201d he says. Mr. Summers, who led the Treasury Department under President Clinton and has at different times held jobs as President Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, Harvard University\u2019s president and World Bank chief economist, claims to have \u201cno confident view on what will or \xa0won\u2019t succeed\u201d in the future. Instead, he says, \u201cI am much more confident that the world of payments will look very different 20 years from now than I am about how it will look.\u201d Noting some of the arguments against bitcoin, he cited wild fluctuations in its price and that restrictions imposed on online gambling show that if \u201cgovernments are determined to choke something off, they can succeed.\u201d The idea, he added, that a digital-currency world is \u201cgoing to be a libertarian paradise\u2026 is not a terribly plausible vision.\u201d But then he offers this to critics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies: \u201cThe people who rejected the Internet as a curiosity for scientists were on the wrong side of history, the people who rejected digital photography as really an artificial thing were on the wrong side of history, and the people who felt that non-gimmicky tennis racquets were made with wood were on the wrong side of history. So it seems to me that the people who confidently reject all the innovation here [in new payment and monetary systems] are on the wrong side of history.\u201d To Mr. Summers, the potential contained in bitcoin\u2019s breakthrough technology, with its fast, low-cost system for confirming transactions, is demonstrated by problems with the current multi-layered system for domestic and global fund transfers. He cites, for one, \u201cthe costs to transfer money to a child in college either within the United States or across international borders, or more consequently, what it costs an immigrant to remit money to Mexico or the Philippines.\u201d Mr. Summers also notes that the existing system requires \u201cenormous investment\u201d in mitigating credit-card fraud and that in an \u201cincreasingly uncertain world\u201d there\u2019s a natural desire to have \u201csecure global stores of value,\u201d a role that some digital-currency enthusiasts see being performed by these new instruments. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to stand with those who are sure they have seen the future here,\u201d he concludes, \u201cbut it seems to me that it\u2019s a serious mistake to write this off as either ill-conceived or illegitimate.\u201d \u2013 Follow Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $444.32, up 0.01% (via CoinDesk) -\xa0To Jesse Powell, the CEO of Payward, which operates the Kraken exchange, Bloomberg\u2019s decision to report bitcoin prices\xa0on its terminals, was \u201ca big step forward for the industry\u201d that shows \u201cat least a recognition that there is some interest out there.\u201d\xa0Bitcoin price quotes provided by Kraken and Coinbase went live and up on Bloomberg terminals as of this morning. Bloomberg is being careful to point out that its decision on its terminals, which are omnipresent on Wall Street trading desks, does not amount to an editorial statement on the digital currency. It\u2019s a point well taken, but it\u2019s also clear that the decision represents a new level of awareness for bitcoin. Mr. Powell said he was hopeful the placement would end up being a big source of referrals for Kraken, but he wouldn\u2019t have a gauge of how much interest the firm was getting from Bloomberg machines for at least a few days. Mr. Powell said he\u2019d been in discussions with Bloomberg for several months on the move, and surmised his firm was chosen, along with Coinbase, because of the work they\u2019ve done building a stable platform. \u201cKraken\u2019s taken an extremely cautious, conservative approach to compliance,\u201d he pointed out, and added that certainly Bloomberg wouldn\u2019t want a Mt. Gox-style meltdown from one of its data providers. \u201cI think they probably chose to go with people who would be around, who weren\u2019t going to be facing either regulatory or criminal problems.\u201d For now, there aren\u2019t any discussions about next steps. As far as Mr. Powell knew, Bloomberg wasn\u2019t planning any. But he said he\u2019s talked to Bloomberg about a \u201clot of things,\u201d and would of course be open to helping get live trading onto the terminals. \u201cI would like that,\u201d he said. (Paul Vigna) -Larry Summers isn\u2019t exactly a bitcoin evangelist, but he could be just the kind of friendly Washington insider that the digital currency needs.  In guarded by positive terms, the former Treasury Secretary explained to us why he thinks there\u2019s huge potential in the technology underlying bitcoin and other digital currencies. Basically, it comes down to the former Treasury Secretary\u2019s view that the current, highly inefficient global financial system is ripe for disruption by a low-cost alternative. To Mr. Summers, anyone who dismisses the prospect for bitcoin to achieve that as \u201ceither ill-conceived or illegitimate\u201d risks being on the \u201cwrong side of history.\u201d Read the full write-up of the interview here. (Michael Casey) \xa0 - On Sunday, one cryptocurrency will start moving. Very, very fast. Nascar driver Josh Wise is racing in the Aaron\u2019s 499 at Talledega Speedway in Florida, and his #98 Moonrocket has a most unusual sponsor: dogecoin. As with most things related to dogecoin, what began as a lark \u2013 the idea of buying a Nascar sponsorship \u2013 has become a reality. The dogies raised enough money, about $50,000 (or more than 67 million dogecoin), to paste their beloved mascot on the hood of Mr. Wise\u2019s #98 Moonrocket, owned by former Nascar driver Phil Parsons and his Phil Parsons Racing team. The car will make its debut on Sunday (it\u2019ll be on Fox at 1 p.m.) and pictures of the race car were released this week. To the moon, dogies. To the moon.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $441.95, up 1.1% (via CoinDesk) - Here\u2019s the thing: the hash rate of the bitcoin mining network \u2013 or in simple terms, its computational power \u2013 is about 60 times higher than it was at the start of last fall. What that increase means is that many Northern Hemisphere miners, whose increasingly high-tech computer rigs have been competing in an arms race to grab a limited flow of bitcoins, are about to run into a very big problem: summer. As Mark MacAuley at datacenter consulting firm Blunt Hammer writes on his blog, \xa0the main output of bitcoin mining is heat. The faster, more powerful and more plentiful the computers in that industry become, the more heat they collectively produce. That means this summer will see a bitcoin ecosystem that\u2019s exponentially more heat-producing than it was at the end of last summer. In many of the big warehouse-like datacenters offsetting all that heat is going to be a very expensive proposition. Trying to cool those racks of machines \u201cis like trying to blow into the nozzle on a heat gun to keep your face from burning,\u201d he says. For miners in cold places, this isn\u2019t a big deal as the heat becomes a valuable resource to be recycled back into homes and offices. It also helps if you have a cheap electricity source, hence the big miner leasing operations in geothermal-rich Iceland and hydropower-energized Washington state. But mining capacity is spread across the globe. So, what might happen this summer? In a telephone interview, Mr. MacAuley said he thinks many rigs will have to go off line. After all, bitcoin\u2019s price in dollar terms is now less than half what it was in December, at the same time that the mining power they\u2019re competing against is now 10 times what is was then. \xa0(Even between September and December, the hash rate increased sixfold.) This summer, the profit equation just won\u2019t compute. Market forces should help somewhat. As rigs come offline the hash rate of the network will fall, making it more profitable to compete for bitcoin, which would help find a financial balance for those who stick with it. That might also mean some relief for all those mining rig companies whose delivery processes can\u2019t keep up with rising competitive demand and that are dealing with angry customers. It also creates an incentive for mining concentration and consolidation \u2014 more clout for the big guys. A solution is needed. For MacAuley it lies in putting computers in new high-tech liquids that keep the machines cool. He\u2019s talking about a sophisticated new product produced by 3M that has so far struggled to find a market. This summer, Bitcoin could provide it with its moment in the sun. (Michael Casey) - CoinDesk has released an app for iPhone.\xa0The app relays seemingly all the information that\u2019s available on the website: the price index, news feed, some basic charting, an exchange calculator, and an alert tab. The layout is clean, and matches the basic layout and color scheme of the website, so it appears seamless. The move makes sense, of course, but CoinDesk joins a crowded field of bitcoin-related apps, including ZeroBlock\u2019s app, revamped after its acquisition by Blockchain.info.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $442.62, up 3% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin miners have been caught in a digital Catch-22 lately.\xa0Mining has evolved from the early days, when you could do it with a regular desktop PC. Now you need powerful, dedicated machines, commonly called mining rigs. But thanks to the \u201carms race\u201d demanding more expensive, energy-consuming machines and the plunging price of bitcoin, miners placing orders for rigs are finding that by the time their machines arrive, the price has dropped to the point where there\u2019s no money to be made from mining. This isn\u2019t good for the miners, and it isn\u2019t good for the companies supplying the mining equipment, either. The last thing they need is miners simply walking away because it\u2019s too expensive. To that end, KnCMiner announced on its website today that it\u2019s offer miners a deal: customers who\u2019ve placed orders for its Neptune line, described as the \u201cgranddaddy of all bitcoin mining machines,\u201d will be gifted a second machine. The new machines are from the company\u2019s third-batch of production, are worth about $6,000, and will essentially double the customer\u2019s mining power. \u201cWe know that it is getting tougher to successfully mine in this environment and we want our customers to have every advantage we can give them,\u201d said KnCMiner CEO Sam Cole said in a release. \xa0(Paul Vigna) - We\u2019ve reported several times that BTC China, the big Middle Kingdom bitcoin exchange, had yet to get the hammer from its banks. Well, now the hammer has struck: China Merchants Bank, one of the biggest banks in China, canceled it bitcoin-related accounts with BTC China, in effect forcing BTC China to stop taking yuan-denominated deposits. This followed a public statement by China Merchants that it would stop servicing bitcoin-related transactions. The news dinged bitcoin prices, in what\u2019s been a familiar dance. There are three differences this time: The involvement of China Merchants, the public statement from the bank, and the involvement of BTC China. Bitcoin prices fell 15% in the aftermath of the, trading down around $423. They\u2019ve since recovered some of that ground.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $460.89, down 7.9% (via CoinDesk) -\xa0Beijing still seems to matter for the price of bitcoin. Given that Chinese trading in the digital currency has dried up considerably since the government first started cracking down on banks\u2019 interactions with bitcoin businesses in December, you\u2019d think the market\u2019s capacity to be surprised might have similarly dried up. But here we are, once again, with reports of some negative statements by officials at the People\u2019s Bank of China and bitcoin\u2019s international price is down sharply. Specifically, today\u2019s $40 drop is being attributed a report in Caixin Online that central bank officials had held meetings with various commercial banks and reiterated their concerns about banks providing services to bitcoin businesses. The report said that during the closed-door meetings, the officials \u201cspecifically criticized various commercial banks for continuing to do business with BTC China,\u201d the country\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange. The PBOC had earlier set an April 15 deadline for banks to cut off bitcoin firms\u2019 accounts, a development that weighed heavily on bitcoin\u2019s price and caused a further drop in trading in China. But BTC China CEO Bobby Lee said he never received notification from his bankers and so continued to operate after that date. He wasn\u2019t available this afternoon (New York time) for comment. Friday\u2019s report comes just two weeks before the Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing, which\xa0organizers are billing as the \u201cfirst global bitcoin conference in China.\u201d It will feature prominent bitcoin personalities such as entrepreneur Roger Ver and journalist and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. \xa0(Michael Casey) - When you think about what bitcoin is literally, there\u2019s not much there. Just strings of computer code. That\u2019s it, really. But when you think about what bitcoin is figuratively, it becomes something else completely. The cryptocurrency keeps being a subject of interest to the arts community. The latest example of that was a one-night show on Thursday called \u201cProof of Work\u201d at a The Sub gallery in the mission district of San Francisco, which called upon artists to explore the connections between digital technologies and the human condition. The piece that most directly speaks to the bitcoin Zeitgeist was \u201cFree Lunch\u201d by Oakland artist David Kim, pictured above, a multimedia piece that he completed just in time for the show. It shows Dorian Nakamoto \u2013 the man named by Newsweek in March as the creator of bitcoin \u2013 as he attempts to evade the media during the frenzy after the story broke. Mr. Kim initially named the piece \u201cEvasive Maneuvers,\u201d but was convinced to change it by somebody at the show who suggested \u201cFree Lunch.\u201d (The title refers to something Nakamoto said.) Mr. Kim wasn\u2019t a bitcoiner before this; he said he\u2019d heard of bitcoin only in the popular culture, but began doing more research when he was asked to be in the show. From his research, he thought the story of Dorian Nakamoto was the most intriguing. \u201cI sat there for hours, digging into the whole situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I was inspired to do the image of Dorian.\u201d The piece is for sale, Mr. Kim said.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $491.07, up 0.9% (via CoinDesk) \u2013An unorthodox fund-raising drive by digital currency startup Maidsafe offers evidence of the\xa0bitcoin community\u2019s enthusiasm for so-called \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d applications. Maidsafe, which vows to \u201cdecentralize the Internet,\u201d says it raised the equivalent of $6 million in just five hours by selling its \u201csafecoins\u201d via a first-round crowd-funding operation. Maidsafe press representatives claim the $6 million figure makes this the most successful crowd-funding in history, beating out ventures that have used sites such as KickStarter to lure investors to fund projects for everything from film making to computer games. Apples-to-oranges comparisons complicate that claim. A couple of prior projects have raised more than $8 million via Kickstarter, but those took place over a month. Maidsafe\u2019s initial offering took just five hours. Another wrinkle: complications over the exchange rates for the two digital currencies used in the fund raising forced the Maidsafe founders to personally buyback newly issued safecoins and reissue them so some burned speculators weren\u2019t left out. Their effort to make whole the burned investors has mostly been welcomed by bitcoiners\xa0 \u2013 even if a few complained of being duped by an elaborate \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme. The consensus is that Maidsafe was just overwhelmed by the unexpected demand for their concept. The biggest takeaway then is that these Bitcoin 2.0 ideas are hot. Another one, called Ethereum, will use its own internal currency and decentralized network verification system to allow programmers to produce specialized applications that also remove middlemen from all sorts of human interactions. According to its website, it foresees automated markets in areas as diverse as voting, domain names and intellectual-property contracts. Other Bitcoin 2.0 outfits include Bitshares, which will help innovators found entirely decentralized, software-automated companies that pay out earnings to shareholders in their own currency-like \u201cbit-shares,\u201d and Permacredits, which issues tokens under rules established by another decentralized network so as to reward and incentivize investments in permaculture projects.\xa0 (Michael Casey) \u2013Demystifying digital currency was a clear intent of \u201cThe Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,\u201d which opened at New York\u2019s Tribeca Film Festival Wednesday night. By that gauge, Daniel Mross\u2019s night was made by a security guard at the School of Visual Arts Theater on 23rd St. The narrator of the documentary, whose bitcoin obsessions caught the attention of his filmmaker brother, Nicholas, says the guard stopped him after the show and said, \u201cThis was a great film.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $482.18, down 0.5% (via CoinDesk) - Spend any time around bitcoiners, and you will hear a lot of big ideas. So it\u2019s not at all surprising that one group of bitcoiners is talking about putting bitcoin into space. The BitSat project, an effort from Jeff Garzik\u2019s Dunvegan Space start-up, has contracted with a private firm named Deep Space Industries to develop and launch a cluster of nanosatellites that can tie into the bitcoin network and be used to broadcast blockchain transactions. The team from Deep Space Industries will begin building the spec plans now, and expects to submit them to public comment by August. The whole thing, they estimate, will cost somewhere between $2-$5 million, which sounds absurdly low for a satellite system (they plan to raise the funds via a Kickstarter campaign). However, these nanosatellites, called \u201ccubesats,\u201d are really, really small \u2013 four inches \u2013 and are put into orbit by hitching rides on other launches, which greatly lowers the expense. Depending upon how much funding they get, they plan to put up to eight satellites into orbit. This is not an effort to build a bitcoin platform that could survive some catastrophe that wipes out the Internet, said Mr. Garzik, BitPay\u2019s senior software engineer and head of Dunvegan. \u201cIf you have a whole Internet disruption, then we can\u2019t help you,\u201d he told BitBeat. The satellite system will be wired into the existing bitcoin network. However, it will be protected in such a way that were there a localized attack on the network, the satellites could operate as a back-up system that would continue broadcasting updates to the blockchain. The other use, he said, would be to provide access to the bitcoin network to people in places where there\u2019s spotty Internet connections but stronger mobile-phone connections, like Africa, he said. In a free-ranging conversation with BitBeat, Mr. Garzik admitted there was a bit of a \u201cbecause we can\u201d element to the project. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic science experiment,\u201d he said, \u201cand it really stimulates the private spaceflight industry at a key time.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - After Dorain S.

This week, Mr. Antonopoulos, the chief security officer at Blockchain, delivered the money, and together they taped this short video, in which Dorian thanks the community and reiterates again that he is not Satoshi Nakamoto:  One thing that stood out to us: Dorian, who said that he\u2019d never heard of bitcoin before all this, says on the video that he is going to be a bitcoin user and part of the community.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $486.69, down 1.3% (via CoinDesk) - We\u2019ve descended down the rabbit hole of who owns and owned the bitcoin.com domain name, after last week\u2019s story about blockchain leasing the pricey real estate piqued our interest. Perhaps the most notable thing about the history of bitcoin.com is how unremarkable the name \u201cbitcoin\u201d is in retrospect. At least three owners held it before Satoshi Nakamoto picked the name in 2008 for his digital currency. It has been owned by two telecom companies, entrepreneurs in and out of the cryptocurrency world, and currently by somebody who\u2019s sitting in the shadows. The name bitcoin.com, far as we can see, was first registered in 2000 to a Swedish company named Hurricane Communication AB. The company let it lapse, and in 2003 it was picked up by an Korean company, IVN Technology, which appeared to hold it until 2005. It lay fallow until January 2008, when Jesse Heitler, a Yale student and budding entrepreneur, registered the name again. Mr. Heitler was working on his own payments system, a service that would provide metered payments for websites, and he simply struck upon the name Bitcoin, he told BitBeat. The business didn\u2019t work out. \u201cPayments businesses are very hard to prove,\u201d he said. He let the business go, but held onto the domain. At this point, he had heard of bitcoin and was getting periodic offers to buy the name. He held on until July 2010, when he got an offer from David Lowy, a Vancouver businessman and domain-name squatter, who offered $2,000. \u201cI didn\u2019t think bitcoin was going anywhere,\u201d Mr. Heitler said. So he made a decision he regrets today: He sold it. Mr. Lowy confirmed that he did indeed pay $2,000 for the name in July 2010. \u201cI have on occassion purchased domains that I think are strategic for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very good success rate with that.\u201d He said he had scooped up a bunch of Internet-gambling related names before that took off, and he currently owns, among others, the domain mastercoin.net (a \u201cwhois\u201d search turned this one up; Mr. Lowy didn\u2019t even recall offhand that he owned it). Mr. Lowy is holding onto deliver.com, he told us, and his asking price for that name \u201cis $1 million.\u201d At some point, Mr. Lowy confirmed that he sold bitcoin.com \u2013 a transaction about which he would not divulge any information, except to acknowledge that he received \u201cmore\u201d than he paid for it. During the time he owned it, he said, it was not being used. In September 2011, the site became live again, and it was pointing readers to Jered Kenna\u2019s Tradehill bitcoin exchange (we wrote about Mr. Kenna last week). By this point, the name had become far more valuable. Mr. Kenna had purchased the name from the anonymous owner who bought it from Mr. Lowy, and paid $1 million in equity for it. Mr. Kenna\u2019s firm failed in 2012, and he remitted the domain back to the previous owner, which was part of their initial agreement. That owner took the name back, leased it out to CoinBase, apparently around September 2013, and then last week, Blockchain announced that it had acquired that lease. The interesting thing about all three men with whom we spoke is that they are all almost compulsive entrepreneurs. Mr. Heitler runs an online marriage counseling business and is considering building a business supplying electricity to bitcoin miners. Mr. Lowy said he is involved in building \u201cbitcoin 2.0\u2033 companies and is managing his clutch of domain names. Mr. Kenna runs a \u201chacker house\u201d in San Francicso, has another business selling \u201cpaper-wallet\u201d printers, and is working on another project about which he spoke of only off-the-record. They have one other thing in common: they all owned, for a period of time, the crown jewel of cryptocurrency URLs. (Paul Vigna) UPDATE: Mr. Lowy is holding deliver.com.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $491.32, down 1.2% (via CoinDesk) \u2013A divided Federal Electoral Commission is being pushed to shed light on a question of great concern to many bitcoiners: How should political campaigns treat donations granted in digital currency? At a hearing Wednesday, the FEC will consider an advisory request from Make Your Laws, a non-partisan political action committee, or PAC, that focuses on democratic reforms and is seeking clarity on what it can and can\u2019t do with bitcoin donations. How the Commission responds could come down to a compromise between competing visions articulated in two draft responses to the PAC\u2019s request, both of which were posted on the FEC\u2019s website last week. One FEC approach would limit bitcoin donations to no more than the equivalent of $100 per donor, would require that the bitcoins be converted into cash within 10 days and would prohibit the PAC from making its own expenditures in the digital currency. The other would be more permissive, imposing no limits on the value and allowing the PAC to treat the coins as donations in kind and to directly use them for expenditures. Make Your Laws, whose main objectives are to enhance democracy rather than pursue a partisan agenda or promote bitcoin, deliberately took a compromise position in response to the FEC drafts. In a letter Sunday, the PAC wrote, \xa0\u201c[W]e should be required to have the $100 limit,\u201d the PAC wrote, \u201cbut allowed to expend non-liquidated contributions and treat bitcoin as an in-kind contribution.\u201d The FEC\u2019s final advice, which it is scheduled to deliver by May 5, will apply to this specific case and so covers others like it but \xa0won\u2019t be a blanket ruling on bitcoin donations per se. Nonetheless, Make Your Laws founder Sai (he has only one name)\xa0said \u201cit was very much our intent to set a precedent,\u201d as the PAC\u2019s hopes to bring transparency in an area of campaign finance that\u2019s lacking it. Explaining its preference for the $100 limit, Sai said that although he is supportive of bitcoin and owns some of the digital currency himself, he recognizes that current challenges associated with auditing donations in bitcoin create electoral transparency concerns. The FEC hearing comes as bitcoin enthusiasts are increasingly calling on their community to use political donations in the digital currency to lobby legislators to pass accommodative regulations. But until now, the FEC has mostly stayed mum on the matter, even as the list of campaigns receiving bitcoins grows. An August request from the Conservative Action Fund PAC for advice got nowhere after the Commission\u2019s six members ended up deadlocked. Data on the Make Your Laws website lists 17 political organizations now accepting bitcoin, including Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Tex.) who has emerged a strong backer of the digital currency\xa0and \xa0Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who has announced a run for governor.\xa0(Michael Casey) - Charlie Shrem remains under house arrest, charged with money laundering by federal authorities.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $494.86, down 6.5% (via CoinDesk) - What\u2019s in a name? Probably quite a lot, if the name is bitcoin.com. As we reported earlier, Blockchain signed a five-year lease for the domain name bitcoin.com, which it is using as a central launching pad for its various services. The firm wouldn\u2019t disclose what it paid for the URL, or from whom it is leasing it. One thing, though, we do know: The firm that held the rights before Blockchain was its main competitor, Coinbase. The history of the domain name and its owner is a bit of a mystery, in fact. One person who held the rights to the name in 2011 was Jered Kenna, a bitcoin entrepreneur who co-founded an early bitcoin exchange called Tradehill. Mr. Kenna spoke with BitBeat, and while he, too, wouldn\u2019t disclose the name of the site\u2019s owner, he did say that he leased it in 2011 from the owner for an equity stake in his firm that at the time was worth $1 million. Part of the deal included an agreement that if Tradehill went out of business, Mr. Kenna would return the rights to the name to the owner, which he did in early 2012 after Tradehill failed as an exchange. At some point after that, Coinbase came to hold those rights. It isn\u2019t exactly clear how Blockchain scooped up the name. Coinbase wouldn\u2019t comment for this story and Blockchain declined to discuss it. However, the two firms do have a contentious history. Ben Reeves, Blockchain\u2019s founder, in 2012 met Brian Armstrong, who would go on to found Coinbase. The two started planning a \u201cPayPal for bitcoin,\u201d according to this Wired story, but they had a falling out over a key question: who would hold access to the password for a customer\u2019s account. Armstrong favored the company, Reeves favored the account-holder, it was irreconcilable, and they went their separate ways. Both have been successful, but the philosophical split remains a key difference between the two companies. Blockchain would confirm only that it paid more than the entry level price for a domain name on GoDaddy (about $13 a year). If the name was worth $1 million in 2011, it\u2019s a fair bet it\u2019s worth more than that now.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $511.26, down 1.7% (via CoinDesk) - Is bitcoin mining still profitable for the little guy? We had read that demand for mining equipment had slowed thanks to the fall of bitcoin\u2019s price from its peak of $1,146 in December to below $400 last week. But KnC Miner, a leading supplier of super-fast rigs for mining the virtual currency, says it has just sold out of its initial 400 run of converted high-end \u201cJupiter\u201d machines, which have a capacity of three terahashes a second. (Hashing is the work that miners do to confirm transactions in the bitcoin network and for which they earn bitcoin as compensation.) So we asked the folks at HashPlex, which offers hosting services for bitcoin miners in cheap-power locales such as hydropower-rich Washington state, to figure out the breakeven rate based on their fees. Conclusion: It\u2019s not a guaranteed route to riches, but mining is still profitable. The capacity to profit depends on the mining rig\u2019s computational power \u2014 relative to that of the entire network \u2014 its rate of power consumption, the cost of electricity and, most importantly, the price of bitcoin. That\u2019s because as each miner goes about the task of hashing, it competes with all the other miners for access to the limited stream of 25 bitcoins that the digital currency\u2019s core software program releases every 10 minutes. Based on the bitcoin network\u2019s current estimated total computational capacity of 900,000 terahashes per second, Hashplex\u2019s vice president of engineering, George Schnurle, estimates that KnC Miner\u2019s\xa0\xa0Neptune machine could in the first month earn $108 per day after paying HashPlex\u2019s fee of $100-per-kW month. However, as the network\u2019s hashing power is expected to increase by 1%-to-2% per day, the machines\u2019 s daily intake will drop to $80 one month later and to $60 the following month. (This is because the rig\u2019s computational power is static and it\u2019s competing for access to a finite stream of bitcoins against a network that\u2019s constantly increasing its hashing capacity.) Still, by that time you would have earned a total of $7,440 and paid off the $6,000 outlay for the Neptune. Over the lifetime of the unit, Mr. Schnurle says, you might gross $10,000 for a net profit of $4,000 \u2013 before taxes, of course.\xa0 That lifetime question is key. Eventually the machines become so uncompetitive that you can\u2019t cover the cost of running them and \xa0need to be upgraded to a faster machine. At Hashplex\u2019s rates, Mr. Schnurle\xa0estimates that the miner would stay profitable for 12 to 18 months but it would would last only six months in a traditional data center charging $0.30-per- kW hour. Now, if the price were to rise to $1,000, the same machine could make $14,880 in the first three months, whereas if it dropped to $250 it would take a lot longer to be profitable. The short history of bitcoin suggests that either of those scenarios is possible. \xa0(Michael Casey) - Has Satoshi Nakamoto been unmasked, again?\xa0A team of students and researchers at Aston University in the U.K. spent the past month-plus, since Newsweek\u2019s story about Nakamoto, analyzing the writing of the 11 most likely suspects, and concluded it was Nick Szabo, a well-known coder and somebody who\u2019s been tagged as Nakamoto previously.

The study by students and researchers at Aston University in Birmingham claims\xa0a linguistics analysis of the writings by people most often listed as bitcoin\u2019s potential creator\xa0leads them to believe that Nick Szabo, a well known name in cryptography circles, is the mysterious father of the digital currency. A group of 40 students and researchers at the university studied the writing of 11 candidates, concluding that Mr. Szabo\u2019s writings have \u201cuncanny\u201d similarities to the writing found in the\xa0initial October 2008 white paper on bitcoin. It\u2019s important to stress that the team isn\u2019t saying its study points conclusively to Mr. Szabo, only that of the people it studied, he appears \u2013 on the basis of his writing \u2013 to be the most likely candidate. That is a far cry from a smoking gun. It\u2019s just another clue. \u201cOur study adds to the weight of evidence pointing towards Nick Szabo,\u201d said Dr. Jack Grieve, a lecturer in forensic linguistics at the university and the study\u2019s leader, in a statement. \u201cThe case looks pretty clear-cut. Szabo is an expert in law, finance, cryptography and computer science\u2026Did Nick Szabo create Bitcoin? We\u2019re not sure, but we think he probably wrote the paper so it\u2019s certainly worth a closer look.\u201d Mr. Szabo is known for his work in digital contracts and currency. He developed a precursor to bitcoin called bit gold, and has written\xa0in depth about a fairly wide array of topics\xa0including the security of online commerce. An earlier, anonymously published textual analysis also claimed that Mr. Szabo\u2019s\xa0writings pointed to him as the likely creator of the currency. Mr. Szabo\u2019s was unavailable for\xa0comment. Furthermore, George Washington University says that despite widespread reports that Mr. Szabo worked as a law professor at the school, it has no records of his ever working there in that capacity. The university did confirm, though, that he received a law degree from the school in 2006. The Aston University team looked at the writing of 11 men, all of whom at one time or another have been rumored to be \u201cSatoshi\xa0Nakamoto,\u201d the author of the 2008 white paper. In addition to Mr. Szabo, they were Dorian S. Nakamoto, the man named by Newsweek in March;\xa0Hal Finney, the first person to work with the pseudonymous Nakamoto on bitcoin; Jed McCaleb, the founder of Mt. Gox; Dustin Trammell; Gavin Andresen, currently the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation; Vili Lehdonvirta; Michael Clear; Shinichi Mochizuki;Wei Dai; and the team of Neal King, Vladimir Oksman, and Charles Bry, whose names appear on patents in August 2008 for systems that look similar to bitcoin. In a press release, the school writes: The results showed that of the eleven Szabo is by far the closest match, with a large number of distinctive linguistic traits appearing in both the Bitcoin paper and Szabo\u2019s blogs and other writings. This includes the use of: the phrases \u201cchain of\u2026\u201d, \u201ctrusted third parties\u201d, \u201cfor our purposes\u201d, \u201cneed for\u2026\u201d, \u201cstill\u201d, \u201cof course\u201d, \u201cas long as\u201d, \u201csuch as\u201d and \u201conly\u201d numerous times, contractions, commas before \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018but\u2019, hyphenation, \u2018-ly\u2019 adverbs, the pronouns \u2018we\u2019 and \u2018our\u2019 in papers by a single author; fragmented sentences following colons and reflexive (-self) pronouns. In total hundreds of documents written by the eleven possible authors were considered, including over 40 academic papers written by Szabo which are available on his personal website.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $496.84, up 8.6% (via CoinDesk) - It may be impossible to know exactly how many people are part of the bitcoin community, but there\u2019s a new site called bitnodes that is trying to track the number of \u201cnodes\u201d (each representing a server, or a server farm) on the bitcoin network,\xa0and it\u2019s turning out some surprising results. The country with the largest number of nodes, 3,236 currently, is the U.S.; that\u2019s 38% of all the nodes counted so far. Germany is number two, the U.K. number three, and Canada comes in fourth. But Germany represents just 6.2% of all the nodes. In other words, the numbers drop off dramatically after the U.S. count. The biggest surprise on the top-1o list is Ukraine, with currently is number nine (and has moved up a few notches since we first saw the site), with 149 nodes, about 1.7% of all available. The site currently records users in 96 countries, with a number of one-node entries, like Zimbabwe, Macedonia, Aruba, and Lebanon. (Paul Vigna) \u2013How about that price action, eh?\xa0For a couple of financial reporters who\u2019ve watched all manner of markets over the years, it sure is fun watching the price of bitcoin. The declines of the past month had seemed so relentlessly one-way that some of the virtual currency\u2019s critics were gleefully ringing its death knell. Now, two days out from Friday\u2019s five-month low of $355.38, the price rose as high as $514.72 on Tuesday. They don\u2019t call bitcoin the honey badger of money for nothing. As is often the case, it\u2019s not easy to get a definitive explanation for this Lazarus-like rebound. Nonetheless, we find it curious that it has coincided with the arrival of April 15, a date that loomed large in bitcoiners\u2019 minds this past month. For one, it\u2019s the filing deadline for U.S. income taxes, arriving just three weeks after the Internal Revenue Service declared that bitcoin would be subject to capital gains taxes. Many bitcoiners have hopefully concluded that the IRS won\u2019t penalize them if they let 2014 slide for now, but there were signs that others were more cautious and pared down their holdings to finance possible tax bills. After the IRS announcement on March 25, the virtual currency fell 38% from $582.28 to its low on Friday. Does the rebound since then \u2013 more or less the same magnitude as the decline in percentage terms \u2014 imply that those fund-raising sales are over? The other April 15 deadline was imposed on China\u2019s banks by its central bank, which ordered them to sever their ties with bitcoin exchanges by that date. And, indeed, China-based exchanges Huobi and OKCoin reported receiving termination statements. But, after checking in frequently with Bobby Lee, the CEO of BTC China, we\u2019ve learned that his exchange never received one. Until he does, Mr. Lee has said, it will be business as usual at China\u2019s most well-known bitcoin exchange. Who knows what the next big test for bitcoin will be. But at least April 15 is out of the way. (Michael Casey) - One sign of continued optimism: the first bitcoin job fair.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $424.49, up 18% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin prices are surging on Friday, up nearly 20%, after reports in the Chinese press that the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, said the government is not going to ban bitcoin. CoinDesk reports that Mr. Zhou, speaking at a conference in Boao, Hainan, said \u201cit is out of the question of banning bitcoin as it is not started by central banks.\u201d His statement is significant. Stories about China banning bitcoin have been floating around for the past month, but the People\u2019s Bank had not made any public pronouncements. So having the bank\u2019s leader actually address bitcoin, and say something vaguely supportive, is enough to drive up the price of the beleaguered cryptocurrency. However, to our eyes, it appears to be a very carefully crafted statement. The issue, as evidenced by yesterday\u2019s news, hasn\u2019t been whether the PBOC would ban bitcoin, but whether the PBOC, through unofficial rule-making, would prevent Chinese banks from handling bitcoin-denominated business. Even if Mr. Zhou meant what he said, the central bank could still order banks to distance themselves from bitcoin-related business. Still, a more friendly stance from the PBOC, or any official-type agency, \xa0in whatever form it takes, is welcome news for cryptocurrencies in general. (Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin took some more baby steps toward recognition on a skeptical Wall Street this week, when it showed up as payment option for attendees of the Security Traders Association of New York\u2019s annual dinner and conference. Getting a newfangled, little understood virtual currency on the agenda was no small feat for those who pushed for it. STANDY has been holding these dinners, which on all accounts are liberally accompanied by alcohol, for 78 years. Much of its membership is comprised of guys like Aldo Parcesepe, who ran Bear Stearns\u2019 Nasdaq trading operations for 25 years in a career that spanned four decades \u2013 a \u201clegend,\u201d according to Albert Fried & Co. floor broker Christopher Cornette, who\u2019d engaged him in an impassioned argument about bitcoin after the pair had listened to a panel discussion on the matter. So, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that the bitcoin payment option was met with \u201csome hesitation, especially from the bulge bracket participants,\u201d as STANDY board member Bill Karsh, who pushed for it, put it. Part of the thinking behind the bitcoin idea was \u201cto bring in a younger group of participants,\u201d said Karsh, who is chairman of bitcoin exchange operator Atlas ATS and has held senior management positions with various stock exchange operators over the years. \u201cI\u2019m on the back nine. I\u2019d like to bring in the twenty-somethings and the thirty-somethings,\u201d he said, gesturing to baby-faced 33-year bitcoin entrepreneur Brock Pierce, who\u2019d just made his pitch for the digital currency in a panel discussion. At the start of that panel, SecondMarket CEO Barry Silbert, whose firm has created the Bitcoin Investment Trust, asked for a show of hands for audience members to define themselves as either \u201cbitcoin believer\u201d or \u201cbitcoin skeptic.\u201d His count came up with 5% for the former, 95% for the latter \u2014 pretty much as he\u2019d expected, he said. But afterwards, Mr. Pierce said the questions he\u2019d gotten nearly all came from guys who described themselves as skeptics. He counts that as progress. Just don\u2019t ask Aldo Parcesepe to buy in. \u201cI don\u2019t understand who\u2019s going to back that currency. I don\u2019t see a store of value in it,\u201d he said, shaking his head.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $386.10, down 12% (via CoinDesk) -Could Mt. Gox actually come back from the dead?\xa0That\u2019s the plan proposed by a group of high-profile bitcoin investors. And it\u2019s all laid out in documents seen by The Wall Street Journal where they seek the approval of a Japanese court to revive the bankrupt and much-maligned digital-currency exchange. The names behind the consortium aren\u2019t that well known outside of virtual-currency circles, but they constitute big shots in the bitcoin world: Brock Pierce, CEO of GoCoin, venture capitalists Matthew Roszak of SilkRoad Equity and William Quigley of Clearstone Venture Partners. With John Betts, a former maven of electronic trading at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, at the helm of a revived exchange, their plan is to trade back to profitability and funnel half of the transaction fees back to customers who were burned by the exchange\u2019s collapse in February. There are no guarantees the court will agree to this plan. One hurdle is the price. The group is offering a token one bitcoin payment, according to people familiar with the plan. But then again, as the same people point out, there\u2019s an \u201cinformation vaccum\u201d at Mt. Gox. How, exactly, would anyone put a price on its balance sheet? In fact, from a normal, bricks-and-mortar investor\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s hard to see why anyone would take this project on at all. The group is taking on the whole enterprise, complete with a responsibility to try to repay the customers, who despite the discovery of 200,000 bitcoins last month still have no idea where \xa0550,000 of their bitcoins (worth $212 million) are. \xa0Why would you take that on and take charge of a toxic brand? The answer: because bitcoin as a whole may need it. Mt. Gox was a disaster for bitcoin\u2019s reputation\u2013 especially because many of those who got burned were latecomers to the industry, the kind of folks that the early enthusiasts are counting on to drive the virtual currency\u2019s expansion. \xa0Righting Mt. Gox\u2019s wrongs is seen by some as critical to restoring lost trust. Here\u2019s how one person familiar with the plan put it: \u201cIf it can be fixed in this way, we all stand to benefit as the bitcoin community. If it isn\u2019t, [the Mt. Gox collapse] has probably set bitcoin back a year or more.\u201d In this way, the bitcoin community is different from the dog-eat-dog world of more established industries. Because every bitcoin businessman has a stake in advancing the virtual currency\u2019s future adoption, many will adopt investment positions that leave money on the table or in some small way benefit their competitors. Similar motivations drive many bitcoiners, dogecoiners and other virtual-currency enthusiasts to generously hand out donations to charity. Bitcoin philanthropists are well-meaning but they\u2019re also self-interested. Spreading bitcoin helps to spread the word, build the buzz, increase adoption and, in theory, drive up the price. They make the pie grow so that everyone\u2019s piece is bigger. Whether this same communitarian mindset lives on if and when bitcoin becomes established in the financial system remains to be seen. By then, the pie may have stopped growing, leaving everyone to fight over a bigger piece. But for now, though, in the crazy Bizzarro World of the early bitcoin era, reviving Mt. Gox is a crazy plan that just might work. Whether Messrs. Pierce, Roszak, Quigley and Betts can convince a bricks-and-mortar Japanese court of that is a different matter. (Michael Casey) - Several Chinese bitcoin exchanges got notices from their banking partners on Thursday, alerting them that the banks would no longer handle bitcoin-related transactions. The news drove bitcoin prices down below $400. But BTC China, the biggest of the exchanges, hasn\u2019t gotten any notice, yet, Bobby Lee, the founder and CEO, told MoneyBeat. \u201cWe expect it to happen, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d Until the exchange is told something directly, Mr. Lee said, it plans to keep operating normally. Even once the expected notices do arrive, Mr. Lee said it won\u2019t mean the end of his business, albeit it won\u2019t help. \u201cAs it turns out, running a bitcoin exchange is quite complicated,\u201d he said. It\u2019s even more complicated in China, where the People\u2019s Bank of China is apparently using backdoor-channels to block bitcoin. Mr. Lee called them \u201csecret rules.\u201d While the banks appear banned from handling any bitcoin-denominated business like transactional services, the currency remains legal, Mr. Lee said, and the banks can still maintain relationships with the exchanges themselves. He noted that if he had to, he could accept actual, physical cash from customers. So, it\u2019s complicated. Still, the developments have taken a bite out of his business, which surged in the fall when it appeared the government would embrace digital currencies. Now, he said, they\u2019re basically back to where they were in August.

The notices, as he pointed out, are coming from banks themselves, not from the central bank, which has not made any official announcement although it is widely assumed to be directing the decision. In response, bitcoin prices dropped sharply overnight. On Wednesday afternoon, the price was roughly around $450, and fell to $400 earlier this morning. Most recently, it was at $409.77, down about 7%, according to CoinDesk\u2019s price index. The move, however, had been foreshadowed, and hinted at, and well expected. The story first started filtering out in March, when bitcoin prices fell on what at the time was a rumor that the PBOC would bar businesses from using bitcoin, beginning April 15. A week later, another news report on the story, this time from reliable Chinese media sources, hit bitcoin prices again. BTCtrade said it has a \u201cvery heavy heart\u201d in having to make its announcement, according to a translated web page. The company said it received a noticed from the Agricultural Bank of China, mainland China\u2019s third largest bank, that its account would be frozen on April 15. It appears from the statement that the company plans to stay open, and accept dollar- and yen-denominated assets. Chinese trading accounts for a huge volume of bitcoin trading, so a drop in trading volumes there is going to crimp liquidity in the market, and by extension the price. A relatively little-known Chinese exchange, Huobi, is actually the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, measured by volume. Of the roughly 150,000 BTC traded on April 9, for example, Huobi accounted for about 82,000. The reason this firm doesn\u2019t get more visibility is because its only yuan-denominated assets, so all it\u2019s trading is in a yuan-BTC pair. There are also questions about whether the firm\u2019s volume is coming from legitimate trading or if it\u2019s a digital-currency version of a quote-stuffing, HFT operation. On its site, Huobi said it received a notice from the local branch manager of ICBC bank in Zhongguancun, and several clients apparently met with the branch manager in his office to get an explanation of the situation.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $442.85, down 1.7% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin got a hearing of sorts in the halls of Congress last night.\xa0As part of the educational effort among members of Congress, the team from Robocoin was invited to the nation\u2019s capital to meet with a handful of members of Congress and media, show off their ATM, and talk about cryptocurrencies. \u201cThe overall response was really positive, really optimistic,\u201d Jordan Kelley, the CEO of Robocoin, told MoneyBeat. \u201cOur mission was to go out there and lead the conversation in the right way.\u201d Mr. Kelley and his team explained bitcoin in general and had their ATM up and operating for several hours in a hallway in the Rayburn House Office Building. At least one member of Congress, Rep. Jared Polis (D, Colo.), used it, exchanging $10 for 0.02 BTC. The Robocoin ATM incorporates several features \u2013 requiring a hand print, for instance, and a photo ID \u2013 that Mr. Kelley said went a long way toward quelling some of the concerns about security. Rep. Polis was also pleased with the event. \u201cIt went great,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we wanted to do was raise awareness on Capitol Hill.\u201d For now, he said, there is certainly a higher level of awareness about digital currencies in Congress than in the general population, but there isn\u2019t any kind of consensus about what, if anything, the legislative branch should do. He is among a small group of Congressmen, he said, \u201ctalking around the edges\u201d about the whole issue. He plans to bring more actors from the cryptocurrency world to D.C., and continue with the education campaign. What makes this meeting interest is that it\u2019s coming in the middle of an ongoing effort among lawmakers across the globe to figure out exactly what digital currencies are and what should be done about them (see below for news out of Brazil). There is no prevailing opinion in Congress. Rep. Polis says that he\u2019s \u201cagnostic\u201d on digital currencies, but think it\u2019s important that Congress doesn\u2019t get in the way of any disruptive technology. Others, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, feel differently. Sen. Manchin recently called for an outright bitcoin ban.\xa0(Paul Vigna) - The \u201cheartbleed\u201d bug is sweeping across the Internet.\xa0The security flaw undoes the encryption protections on the web that protect your passwords, user names, and even credit card information from malefactors. According to reports, roughly two-thirds of the sites out there rely on the OpenSSL protocol that\u2019s at the, no pun intended, heart of the problem. The flaw also exposes digital keys. Given encryption is a major feature of the bitcoin protocol, the bitcoin development team quickly crafted a patch that fixes the vulnerability, and released it in a software update, version 0.9.1, after releasing 0.9.0 just a few weeks ago. (Paul Vigna) - If the IRS is still taking comments about its bitcoin-tax decision, many hope it will look at what Brazil just announced. Brazil\u2019s tax authority issued its take on digital currency, according to a story in CoinDesk, which overall is similar to the IRS decision: bitcoin is a financial asset subject to capital gains. However, the agency also carved out an exemption: people selling less than $16,000 worth of digital currencies don\u2019t have to pay the tax. That removes the burden of having to calculate the capital-gains effect of using digital currencies as cash for purchases. (Paul Vigna) - Hal Finney is a key figure in the creation of bitcoin. He is also suffering from ALS. Mr. Finney was one of the first to grasp bitcoin\u2019s implications, and was the first to work with Satoshi Nakamoto in setting up the digital currency (essentially, he was node number two). But since 2009, he\u2019s been battling ALS, a disease that often claims its victim\u2019s lives within 2-5 years. Mr. Finney is stable, thanks to a tracheotomy that helps him breath, but he is also completely dependent upon machines to keep him alive, and his wife, Fran, and son, Jason, for his day-to-day needs. One can imagine the cost of that care. Andy Greenberg, the Forbes writer who recently produced a moving profile of Mr. Finney, has started a bitcoin-donation fund for Mr. Finney, according to newsBTC, and has raised $10,000.

Recognizing the immense\xa0interest, confusion and concern surrounding bitcoin, finance professor David Yermack and law professor Geoffrey Miller are seeking to help students navigate a\xa0murky regulatory environment\xa0and assess the currency\u2019s value. The duo compiled an\xa0early outline\xa0to pitch their bosses on \u201cThe Law and Business of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies,\u201d with classes devoted to topics such as money laundering via bitcoin, how to measure the currency\u2019s trading activities and\xa0whether it\u2019s even a real currency at all.\xa0(The IRS recently declared it property\u2014and subject to \u201cgain\u201d taxes if used to buy something.) But given the fast-changing market\u2014including\xa0wildly fluctuating\xa0valuation,\xa0bankruptcy discussions\xa0and almost daily developments in\xa0legal battles, Yermack says what\u2019s taught come fall will likely have little resemblance to the original draft. \u201cWe have no illusions that six months from now it\u2019ll be the same set of issues,\u201d he said. Even so, Yermack says a few broader topics will remain relevant. For example, he can use bitcoin to explore Milton Friedman\u2019s orthodox monetary policy and the role that human judgment can or should have in determining policy. And the professors expect to address the risk and insurance implications of virtual currency activity, since investors currently can\u2019t insure themselves against\xa0theft or hacking\xa0on bitcoin marketplaces the same way they can at a traditional FDIC-backed bank. Some companies are trying to build such insurance products, and\xa0governments must decide\xa0whether to provide security for a currency that, in some ways, competes with their own. Yermack expects to pack the 50-seat room currently reserved for his class, but he knows the currency\u2019s popularity might be fleeting and, if its value crashes to just $5 or $10 between now and August, interest in the course could evaporate. \u201cThe trajectory of bitcoin is going to be crucial\u201d to whether the class actually happens, he says. Starting to assess bitcoin from an academic angle while the currency is still in its infancy allows Yermack and Miller to set the agenda for future study of the subject. \u201cYou can help shape the field by stipulating what you think the important topics are,\u201d Yermack says. \u201cFor an academic, that\u2019s fun.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Melissa Korn', 'email': 'Melissa Korn'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/04/09/nyu-mining-bitcoin-for-new-class/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 4, 9, 10, 56), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'NYU Mining Bitcoin for New Class'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

Steve Stockman (R, Texas) was at the Inside Bitcoins conference in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, sharing a bill he plans to introduce in Congress asking the IRS to reconsider its decision earlier this month declaring bitcoin property for tax purposes. The bill currently is a draft, a mere one page, directing the IRS to treat bitcoin as currency for tax purposes. Of course, the goal of the bill isn\u2019t necessarily to get Congress to codify bitcoin into law. Rep. Stockman, an aficionado who accepted bitcoin donations for his reelection campaign, is looking to get a conversation going on the topic. \u201cI think it\u2019s not accurate,\u201d he said of the IRS ruling. To him, bitcoin is not a commodity, but a currency. \u201cIt\u2019s not sugar, it\u2019s not gold.\u201d Rep. Stockman concedes to one major problem: There is still much debate, even at the conference, about what bitcoin actually is. He suggested we go into the conference and ask 10 different people, much like he did. \u201cYou\u2019ll get 10 different answers.\u201d Regardless, he plans to introduce his bill later this month. Understanding how slowly Congress moves, and knowing how few of his fellow lawmakers are up on developments in digital currency (if not outright hostile), he isn\u2019t necessarily looking for action there. What he really wants is just to stir up debate on the question, in the hope that the IRS changes its stance. \u201cThe IRS can act quicker than Congress,\u201d he said.

Gox\u2019s bankruptcy and its announcement that it had lost 650,000 bitcoins has fixated the bitcoin community on a problem in real need of a fix: the vulnerability of their \u201cdigital wallets\u201d to theft and hacking attacks. Many believe the solution lies in multi-signature technology, also known as \u201cmulti sig,\u201d in which digital coins cannot be released from the wallet \xa0unless more than one private key \u2013 a unique alphanumeric code that\u2019s used to digitally \u201csign\u201d encrypted transactions \u2014 is applied to it. Now it appears that San Francisco-based wallet provider BitGo has won the race to deliver a mainstream multi-sig wallet. BitGo will generate three different keys for each wallet customer, one that\u2019s attached to the live, online wallet and controlled by the owner, one that\u2019s held in an encrypted format by BitGo, and a third that\u2019s held offline in so-called \u201ccold storage\u201d by the owner. Two of the three keys will need to be signed to complete any transaction. BitGo launched its wallet at the Inside Bitcoins conference and won an endorsements from Bitcoin payment processor Bitpay, which said it plans to promote the BitGo wallet to its 27,000 merchant customers.

The new system, which the company plans to launch on April 22, mimics some of the characteristics of bitcoin: in essence, it replaces the myriad servers that currently host the World Wide Web and replaces it with a decentralized system in which the entire web is hosted among the network\u2019s users\u2019 computers.

Barry Silbert, chief executive officer of SecondMarket, which has created a private bitcoin-dedicated investment vehicle called the Bitcoin Investment Trust, said he could count ten hedge funds interested in investing in bitcoin, \u201ceach of which doesn\u2019t get out bed if they don\u2019t have $50 million.\u201d \u201cSo, I would not be surprised if there is something like $500 million in the float right now, and if there is $500 million waiting to move into this space, it will have a dramatic effect on the price,\u201d Mr. Silbert said. His comments come after the price of the digital has fallen sharply in recent months. Bitcoin\u2019s price peaked at $1,147.25 on Dec. 4, according to an index provided by news provider Coindesk, but has since fallen to $450.61 due to the demands of the U.S. taxman and a string of negative news. \u201cThese headlines \u2013 Russia, Mt. Gox, China \u2013 they don\u2019t help these institutions, which are very, very focused on headline risk,\u201d said Mr. Silbert. He was referring to Russia\u2019s move to declare bitcoin illegal, the collapse of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, and China\u2019s recent ban on banks providing accounts to bitcoin businesses. Mr. Silbert added that the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s recent guidance establishing that bitcoin is a property subject to capital gains tax has also weighed on the price as many holders have sold down their holdings to cover their pre-April 15 tax bills. But he and others on the panel argued that once tax season passes, the prospect for a recovery is solid. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Gil Luria said he has seen \u201ctremendous interest\u201d from clients in bitcoin, which is what prompted him to start doing analytical reports estimating its value. While he said he does not have a formal \u201cprice target\u201d for bitcoin, Mr. Luria said that \u201cif a lot of things happen with it and bitcoin lives up to its promises, it could be half a million to a million dollars.\u201d Mr. Luria said \u201ceven if it accounts for 1% of even the working capital of international payments and it takes 10 years to get there, you end up with a $1,000 price.\u201d In a later panel comprised mostly of venture-capital investors, Matthew Roszak, a co-founder of SilkRoad Equity, said that bitcoin\u2019s value would be underpinned by the investment funds flowing into bitcoin businesses. He said that whereas there was $100 million invested in all of 2013 into \u201cthe bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d there was $50 million invested in the first quarter of 2014 alone. He predicts that the year will see $500 million in the sector for the year as a whole. However, fellow panelist P. Bart Stephens, co-founder and managing partner of Stephens Investment Management cautioned, \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have the links that connect the investment world with the bitcoin world.\u201d And he added, \u201cWe also need more robust infrastructure. I don\u2019t think the bitcoin infrastructure can suffer too many more events like Mt. Gox. If you\u2019re a hedge fund manager looking at different asset classes, it just gives you another excuse to look at something else.\u201d\xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $448.63, down 2.6% (via CoinDesk) \u2013Jeremy Allaire caused a mini-stir with the keynote address to kick off the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York Monday. When the chief executive officer of bitcoin business Circle Internet Financial laid out a path for bringing bitcoin out of its Wild-West beginnings to a more mainstream, regulated environment of widespread use, it wasn\u2019t music to everyone\u2019s ears. One conference attendee, who only gave his name as John, complained to us over lunch that lawyers and bankers were trying to take over the libertarian project of bitcoin. (For the record, he also complained that The Wall Street Journal shouldn\u2019t be attending the event.) But according to Mr. Allaire, better governance, more commercial development of bitcoin businesses and coordination with regulators is precisely what is needed to put bitcoin on a growth path similar to the one the Internet enjoyed after the development of the Netscape browser in 1994. Delving into a hot-button issue, he said that one \u201ccritical component to ultimate mainstream acceptance is the ability to assign identities to transactions\u2026while still maintaining financial privacy and even anonymity but enabling law enforcement \xa0to chase criminal actors that use these platforms.\u201d That prompted some bitterly worded tweets from attendees, who questioned whether this goes against the principles of anonymity enshrined in bitcoin\u2019s early model. But in an interview after his presentation, Mr. Allaire said that all these measures were necessary to give regulators comfort with bitcoin and thus to give banks confidence to provide accounts to businesses developing bitcoin products. Banks \u201chave to believe they have legal clarity on the risk and they are not going to do anything where they are subjecting themselves to those risks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat that requires is clarity from the government\u2026And the major issue that I think is sitting out there is this counterparty identity issue.\u201d Mr. Allaire said that early investors in bitcoin need to realize that the increase in the value of their investments since 2011 was made possible because exchanges created banking relationships. It was that gateway to traditional currency that increased the liquidity and boosted the value of bitcoin, he said, arguing that there needs to be a wider effort to bring banking relationships into the bitcoin economy. Only then can well-funded commercial businesses start to develop what he described as \u201cthe killer app\u201d needed to bring bitcoin into the mainstream. Still, the panel of lawyers that followed Mr Allaire\u2019s speech made it clear that legal clarity is still a ways off. So far only limited progress has been made in designing legal instruments such a money transmitter licenses for digital currencies. One problem, said Jacob S. Farber, senior counsel at Perkins Coie in Washington, D.C., is the fast pace of innovation in the bitcoin economy. \u201cThere is this constant problem where the regulators are catching up to where things were six months ago, and this has created a bit of a stall\u201d in the development of regulatory framework,\u201d he said.

Hong Kong-based startup Cryptex Card provides an online service for quickly converting bitcoins into dollars and loading them on a card that can then be used at ATMs and merchant-based point-of-sale card readers. (Michael Casey) - Dutch bankers don\u2019t care much for bitcoin. The digital currency is not money, but more like a tulip bulb, said Gijs Boudewijn of the Dutch Payments Association (and the Dutch know a thing or two about tulip bulbs and financial markets). Bitcoin is more like a useful technology, he said, something that could easily be adopted by a banking system, according to a report in Coindesk.

Hong Kong-based startup Cryptex Card provides an online service for quickly converting bitcoins into dollars and loading them on a card that can then be used at ATMs and merchant-based point-of-sale card readers. The card, which will function like a prepaid debit card, will be issued under a license tied to Chinese card provider Union Pay, which is accepted in outlets all around the world including the Discover card network in the U.S. Cryptex co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jamon Rahn estimates that holders of the card will be able to use it at 90% of the world\u2019s existing ATM and merchant outlets. The project, which will be launched Monday at the \u201cInside Bitcoins\u201d conference in New York, is the latest attempt to resolve bitcoin\u2019s so-called \u201cgateway\u201d problem. Converting bitcoins into traditional currencies for simple purchases has been a major headache for users of the cryptocurrency. \u201cBitcoin is the fastest way to transmit money but it is currently really prohibitive on where you can spend it and where you can turn it back into money for everyday use,\u201d said Mr. Rahn in a telephone interview from Singapore. \u201cCryptex allows people to have greater convertibility of their bitcoin holdings.\u201d Other initiatives to attempt to make easier to convert bitcoins into traditional currencies include the special bitcoin ATMS developed by firms such as Robocoin and Lamassu and the network of local outlets providing exchange services managed y a firm called ZipZap. Cyrptex\u2019s backers argue that their plan would give holders of bitcoin considerably more flexibility and greater options for using the digital currency. That, in turn, will promote greater bitcoin adoption, they say. Like many bitcoin businesses, Cryptex is grappling with an evolving regime of regulation as governments seek to take greater control over an industry that has been hit with money laundering charges and other scandals. Cryptex customers will be put through identity checks in compliance with standard anti-money-laundering and \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d regulations, said Mr. Rahn, who like his Hong Kong-based co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Andy Cheung, has a background in payment services. In the U.S., Cryptex will impose daily limits on the amount of money that can be loaded on to a card in compliance with money transmitter rules. It\u2019s not clear what other U.S. rules Cryptex will have to meet. Federal regulators have insisted that bitcoin exchanges and payment processors obtain state money transmitter licenses and register with the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. For now, Cryptex can complete a conversion in around 24 hours. Mr. Rahn said he expects a fully automated process will be in place by the early summer to allow instantaneous conversion and card-loading for immediate use for ATM withdrawals or purchases. Currently, the card can only load dollars but Mr. Rahn says there are plans to build capabilities for other currencies. Cryptex charges no fee for producing or delivering the card. Much like a traditional currency broker or bureau de change, it profits by charging an exchange rate above that at which it purchases dollars on bitcoin exchanges. Mr. Rahn said that more favorable rates will be available for customers who make larger purchases. Separate ATM fees will apply in most cases. Seed investors in Cryptex include Tero Ojanper\xe4, managing partner of Finland-based venture capital firm Vision+Fund and a member of the Executive Board of Nokia Corp., Ken Hertz, a senior partner at law firm Hertz Lichtenstein & Young and an early investor in music streaming service Spotify AB, and Michael Terpin, a member of the BitAngels network of digital-currency-focused angel investors. \u201cI have no doubt that there will be competitors to follow [Cryptex], when they are able to figure out their own secret sauce of finding a cooperative bank, a payment network, and a payment processing technology that all seamlessly work together,\u201d said Mr. Terpin. \u201cIn the meantime, Cryptex is positioned for fast growth.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $446.59, down 0.1% (via CoinDesk) \u2013The first government-sponsored digital currency project looks likely to become a private project like most other virtual-currency endeavors. As our Toronto colleague, David George-Cosh, reports, the Royal Canadian Mint is halting development of its MintChip digital currency and looking to sell the business. Is this a failure of the program? Well, it never actually reached circulation phase, despite the Mint reaching an agreement with SecureKey Technologies Inc. in February to make transactions among MintChip users more secure. But Mint spokeswoman Christine Aquino describes this as a sign the virtual currency has \u201cmatured\u201d and that taking it to the private sector is one of MintChip\u2019s \u201cnatural next steps.\u201d Still, it\u2019s hard not to compare this government project \u2014 one that came with all the heavy engagement that entails official sanctions and $50,000 in rewards for developers \u2014 to bitcoin, which is far more pervasive and valuable and whose open-source software development was entirely run by volunteers. (Michael Casey) - Teslas are becoming hot commodities for the crypto set, it seems. Word was passed to us that an auto dealership in Tustin, Calif.,\xa0Benz and Beamer, sold a Tesla Model S P85 to an unnamed buyer, who paid not in bitcoin, but in litecoin, one of the more prominent of the so-called alt-coins. The buyer forked over 5,447 litecoin, equivalent of $90,000, for the car, and the deal was processed via GoCoin, the digital-currency payments processor that handles bitcoin and litecoin, and recently began accepting dogecoin as well. \u201cLitecoin is proving there is room in the market for digital currencies beyond bitcoin,\u201d GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard said in a press release. This isn\u2019t the first Tesla purchased with digital currency. A Lamborghini dealership in California sold one in December to a buyer who paid in bitcoin.

It is not a pretty picture. Nor is a recap of the headlines over that period: Charles Shrem, a high-profile bitcoin entrepreneur, is arrested on charges of helping drug dealers launder money;\xa0 Mt. Gox, once the biggest bitcoin exchanges, files for bankruptcy, and announces that customers\u2019 bitcoins worth around $500 million have vanished; China bans bitcoin exchanges from having bank accounts; the Internal Revenue Service declares that bitcoin is not a currency and is subject to capital gains taxes. All this has kept Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, very busy. He\u2019s the subject of our front-page story today. It\u2019s not as if Mr. Murck is a lawyer for a big corporation. The Bitcoin Foundation is merely a trade group with a mission to promote a digital currency that\u2019s otherwise managed by a decentralized network of computers with no single owner or physical headquarters. But since there\u2019s no one else to turn to in times of stress or to act as an interlocutor with government officials, the Foundation has become the default defender of bitcoin\u2019s reputation. It\u2019s a vital role. For a currency that seeks mainstream adoption and whose success depends on securing people\u2019s trust, reputation is everything. So Mr. Murck, who used to be afraid to fly, now finds himself constantly hopping on planes, rolling up suits and stuffing them into a black backpack. His busy schedule is not solely a sign of the difficulties facing bitcoin. It is also a mark of how the virtual currency has evolved from its beginnings as an off-the-wall experiment that appealed to cryptography geeks and anarcho-libertarians into something that governments want to regulate and which big businesses want to invest in. A spectacular price rally in 2001\u2013even now bitcoin is still up 3100% versus the dollar from Jan. 1, 2013\u2013has attracted attention, as well as tens of millions of venture-capital dollars into startups servicing the bitcoin economy. That economy is expanding rapidly: you can now use the digital currency to buy everything from pizzas to space travel. As Mr. Murck observed when he felt underdressed in jeans and a button-down shirt at a recent bitcoin conference in San Francisco, the suits have arrived in the bitcoin community. The failed Mt. Gox exchange, which was formed out of an online trading platform used for exchanging magic cards, is being superseded by high-tech, robust and fully regulated exchanges backed by Wall Street. The drug dealers are being shooed away and the U.S. government is devising rules to rein in the Wild West excesses and protect people from shysters. Throughout, the Bitcoin Foundation\u2013led by employees like Mr. Murck\u2013is trying to manage this transformation in a way that bolsters use of the digital currency without killing the innovation behind it. Not every bitcoiner is happy about its engagement. Radicals who see the vision of mysterious bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto defined in terms of a decentralized network that\u2019s devoid of institutional control see the Foundation, and the business community behind it, as a sell-out. But just as the Internet itself inevitably went from an experimental idea that appealed to utopian hackers to a globally institutionalized, profit-driven enterprise, so too will bitcoin and the concept of digital currencies grow up. That\u2019s ultimately why the Bitcoin Foundation and Mr. Murck are having their moment in the spotlight. \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $450.58, up 3% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin users, time to brush up on your book-keeping \u2013 or develop some good software to do it for you. It now seems clear that the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s guidance last week that bitcoin be treated as a property asset for tax purposes will impact how people use it in their purchases of goods and services. That\u2019s the upshot of our Washington bureau\u2019s reporting on this matter. The IRS agent who last week told BitBeat flat out that people would only have to worry about taxes if they hold virtual currency for investment purposes now says he \u201cprobably misspoke\u201d and that, under the current rules, taxes will apply if a purchase is done at a rate that implies a capital gain on a person\u2019s bitcoin holdings. What irks people most about this \u2013 including the Bitcoin Foundation, which put a statement on its blog last week \u2013 is the burdensome recordkeeping it demands. Unless the rules are revised, you\u2019re going to have to keep track of the price at which you purchased bitcoin and the price at which you sold them every time you buy a pair of socks on Overstock.com or a ticket to Sacramento Kings game. (See below.) Will the IRS treat this as a fungible capital asset, where all bitcoin are worth the same regardless of which identifier they carry or will the capital gains vary according to which specific bitcoin are used in transactions? Regardless, one thing seems clear: this presents a big opportunity for makers of accounting software such as Quicken to develop services that automate these calculations through the user\u2019s digital wallets and remove the headache from it. The other big outcome we see from the IRS move is that it accelerates the push for a universal and broadly accepted price benchmark. Without one, these calculations are going to be messy and downright unpredictable. The guidance notice said that if the virtual currency is listed on an exchange, taxpayers should use its exchange rate to work out the fair value of their bitcoin purchases and sales \u201cin a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.\u201d But in a world where bitcoin trades 24/7 on a vast array of different exchanges that offer show wide differentials, what price or index should you use? Prediction: once a different regulator involved in bitcoin regulation decides on a particular benchmark, that will become the reference for the IRS. And that could put Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss\u2019s new Winkdex in a positive position. The Winkelvii have developed the Winkdex as a pricing benchmark to bolster the chances of getting their planned exchange-traded fund, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It promises to be a drawn-out process, but once the ETF gains the SEC\u2019s stamp of approval, it might also elevate the Winkdex to a level of broader importance. As with any regulatory change, there are winners and losers in this important decision. (Michael Casey) - The Chicago Sun-Times, which first tested a bitcoin paywall in February, has taken the next step and formally instituted bitcoin as a payment option for the paper, making the Sun-Times the first major U.S. daily to adopt a digital-currency payments option. The digital-currency option is available for subscriptions: daily delivery, a four-days per week option, Sunday only, or \u201ctoday\u2019s paper,\u201d an online option. For now, it appears the paper isn\u2019t offering a micropayment option, where readers could buy single article online. That was the focus of the February experiment. Josh Metnick, chief technology officer at the Sun-Times\u2019 parent company, Wrapports, said the move will allow the company\u2019s development teams to get used to bitcoin, before it adds more goods and service for sale via that route. \u201cIt is the furthering of our BTC processing capabilities such that we can extend it into other content and media products down the line,\u201d he said via email. At the time of the February test, the executives we spoke with were very pleased with the effort, and are seriously focused on trying to use bitcoin as a tool to expand its readership. It will be a very interesting experiment, to see how a media outlet that is so geographically tied to a city does not only with its Chicago-area readers, but with readers outside the Windy City. Mr. Metnick said so far most of the sales have been for the digital version of the paper, and surprisingly most are coming from the New York City area. \u201cThis is really fascinating to watch,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not think we had a market outside of Chicago, even for the digital product.\u201d\xa0(Paul Vigna) - The Sacramento Kings are taking their engagement with the digital currency to a new level.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$443.10, down 7.44% (via\xa0CoinDesk) -One way to nudge consumers toward using bitcoins is to give them a financial incentive. PayStand Inc., a payments-processing company that launched Wednesday, is trying to do just that, by turning the traditional model for payment processing on its head. Rather than hit merchants with a per-transaction fee, the Santa Cruz, Calif.-based startup will charge a flat monthly rate for its service and then seek to recoup whatever costs it incurs from its clients\u2019 customers. That sets up an arrangement where customers are offered a discount if they opt to pay with digital currency instead of credit cards. The savings can be quite significant. \xa0Whereas bitcoin payments incur costs of less than 1% per transaction, fees associated with credit cards can run from between 3% and 5% for each transaction. Under the traditional model, these fees, which are used to compensate banks, credit-card companies and payment processors for handling that payment, are typically charged to the merchant and left invisible to customers. It works very differently at A Bean to Go, an early client of PayStand. Shoppers visiting the Goodrich, MI-based coffee retailer\u2019s \xa0web site who buy a half-pound bag of French Roast coffee, for example, will be charged a total of $16.98 (including shipping and handling) if they pay with a credit card, $16.24 if they pay with an\u201ce-check\u201d debit from their bank account, or $15.99 if they click the \u201ce-cash,\u201d or bitcoin option. While some businesses such as gas stations use a similar setup in the offline world, offering a cheaper price for customers who pay with cash, most retailers don\u2019t differentiate the price they charge for different types transactions. As a result, they end up eating the higher transaction costs on credit cards. \u201cAs we move to digital currency, where money is no more than ones and zeros, the concept of transaction fees is a really antiquated business model, we believe,\u201d\xa0says PayStand founder and chief executive Jeremy Almond. In addition to its hard launch Wednesday, his company announced a $1 million infusion of venture capital investment. So far, A Bean to Go has made only two sales via bitcoin, but owner Kirk Walker says he is hopeful more will come. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about it to give you an educated opinion\u201d about bitcoin, he says, but \u201cI like change, and convenience for my customers is paramount.\u201d (Michael Casey) \u2013Congress\u2019s dalliance with digital currencies moved to a new venue Wednesday.\n\nLess than a week after the Internal Revenue Service caused a stir with its announcement that bitcoin should be treated for tax purposes as property, not as a currency, and so subject to capital gains tax, the House Small Business Committee held hearings into digital currencies\u2019 benefits and risks for small businesses. With one notable exception (which we\u2019ll get to below) \xa0the Committee assembled a rather bitcoin-friendly cast of presenters. The lineup included Adam White, Director of Business Development at bitcoin payment processor Coinbase, Plymouth State University Economist Michael Couvillion, and Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. In their prepared testimony, Messrs. Couvillion and Brito predictably highlighted some the well-recognized risks associated with digital currency \u2013 price volatility, security, regulatory uncertainty. But they also echoed Mr. White\u2019s \xa0positive appraisal of the advantages over traditional payment methods such as credit cards: lower costs, lessened fraud threats and the absence of charge-backs by credit cards. In the end, they both portrayed bitcoin\u2019s technology as promising, with Mr. Couvillion declaring, \u201cDigital currency is here to stay and will ultimately thrive as partial substitutes for credit cards and fiat currency.\u201d Even Committee Chairman Sam Graves (R, Mo.) argued in his opening remarks that bitcoin could be \u201cone of those innovative technologies\u201d that help small businesses \u201ccut costs and gain access to customers.\u201d All of this stood in stark contrast to the testimony of Boston University economist and high-profile skeptic Mark Williams. Calling it a \u201cpseudo currency,\u201d Mr. Williams said bitcoin is \u201cseven times more risky than gold and eight times more risky than the S&P 500,\u201d exhibiting a volatility that could see a small business\u2019s profit margins \u201ccompletely erased in a matter of days.\u201d Although he acknowledged \u2014 along with Messrs. White and Couvillion \u2014 that merchants can avoid exposure to bitcoin by having a payment processor assume that risk, he cited \u201ca dangerous level of industry concentration\u201d in the two leading processors, Coinbase and Bitpay, and conflicts of interest in their market activity. \u201cIf these financial middlemen were to declare bankruptcy, no longer able to honor their obligations, and accounts receivable owed to merchants were not paid, such a scenario could be extremely costly,\u201d he said. And so the stage was set for a lively debate. Watch how it transpired here.\xa0\xa0(Michael Casey) \u2013Bitcoin meets Mooc. If you\u2019re looking for an education in bitcoin and digital currencies, but aren\u2019t looking to take on student loans, the University of Nicosia in Cyprus this spring will be offering a free, open-enrollment MOOC, or Massive Open Online Course, called \u201cIntroduction to Digital Currencies.\u201d The first class begins May 15. The course lasts six weeks, and will explore technical, legal, economic and regulatory issues relating to digital currencies. The teachers for the class are Andreas Antonopoulos, a prominent bitcoin entrepreneur and chief security officer at Blockchain, and Antonis Polemitis, a managing partner at Ledra Capital, an investment firm that is involved in bitcoin projects. The online course is something of an extension of, and introduction to, the university\u2019s masters program in digital currency, which it began offering in the fall, at the same time as the school began accepting bitcoin for all university-related expenses. Students who complete the MOOC can apply credit for it toward the degree. Both the MOOC and masters program are available as online courses.\xa0(Paul Vigna) \u2013The Mt.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $481.85, up 5.1% (via CoinDesk) - China\u2019s central bank means business with its bitcoin crackdown and that\u2019s bad news for mainland China\u2019s digital-currency exchanges. But it could spell opportunity for bitcoin businesses everywhere else. After\xa0news emerged that the People\u2019s Bank of China had ordered banks to close the accounts of bitcoin exchanges by April 15,\xa0Bulgaria-based BTC-e wasted no time announcing that it would allow holders of so-called \u201coffshore yuan\u201d to deposit the Chinese currency with its digital exchanges and trade against it. Offshore yuan \u2013 known by their foreign-exchange ISO code of CNH \u2013 can be legally held in accounts in Hong Kong and other overseas jurisdictions but China strictly limits the degree to which those funds can be moved in or out of mainland China. By all accounts, Hong Kong has become a\xa0 veritable refugee camp for bitcoin businesses from the mainland. Many have relocated to the autonomous territory in response to the regulatory crackdown from Beijing, which began in December with an order banning banks from trading in bitcoin and has since evolved into tougher restrictions directly on bitcoin exchanges. The crackdown is a concern for the global outlook for bitcoin generally, and that\u2019s been seen in the slippage for the international bitcoin price this past week. That\u2019s in part because Chinese citizens have taken to the digital currency with a trading enthusiasm greater than \xa0most others. Until the December announcements, Shanghai-based BTC-China was boasting more trading volume than any other in the world \u2013 most of that in yuan. Now, BTC-China CEO Bobby Lee tells us \xa0\u201cthere will definitely be a negative impact\u201d from this latest ruling to his exchange\u2019s operations. (Michael Casey) - We are still collecting reactions to the IRS\u2019s notice last week on the tax treatment of bitcoin. One that caught our eye is this blog post from the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, which pretty much concludes that the IRS simply got it wrong. \u201cThere are good reasons to believe that they got it wrong,\u201d the group writes. \u201cVirtual currencies are tricky assets to categorize. Sometimes they behave like currencies, sometimes like commodities, and sometimes like stocks. This unique quality is reflected by several wrinkles in the IRS\u2019s approach to virtual currencies, treating them like both capital gains as well as wages.\u201d However,\xa0\u201cThey completely miss the primary use of bitcoin, as a currency for both transactions and wages.\u201d The group argues that looking at bitcoin and the transactions that occur with it makes it clear that it is handled far more often as a currency than as a long-term investment, Joe Henchman, the vice president for legal projects at the think tank, told MoneyBeat. It may have felt more familiar to the IRS to go the capital-gains route, he said, since doing otherwise gets into a lot paradigm-shifting debates. That said, the question \u201cdeserved more thought than the IRS put into this ruling,\u201d he said. It\u2019s one thing for the Bitcoin Foundation to criticize the IRS, given their obvious subjectivity on the matter. The Tax Foundation, though, is removed from the center of the cryptocurrency world. This is, in fact, the first thing the group has ever written on the subject, Mr. Henchman said. Still, the IRS is, as we\u2019ve noted, soliciting open comments on its notice. It\u2019s likely to revisit this decision. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to have to take a look at it sooner or later,\u201d Mr. Henchman said.\xa0(Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin may not strike most people as a subject for art, but it did to Kuno Goda. The Hamburg-based artist, inspired by both the cryptocurrency and the work of Andy Warhol, created \u201c200 Bitcoins\u201d in late 2013, a\xa023.6 x 47.2 inch print on canvas in which appear 200 bitcoin logos. This month, he sold it, according to bitcoin examiner, for a reported $125,000 to an unnamed Seattle businessman. \u201cIt was a private sale and we used bitcoin as a payment method,\u201d Mr. Goda told MoneyBeat. \u201cIt was a flawless experience. International payments can be a real hassle. Not so with bitcoin. It was just a matter of a few clicks.\u201d The actual purchase price, though, Mr. Goda said, ended up being less than $125,000 (he declined to disclose the final price), since the value of bitcoin changed in the time between the agreement and the closing of the sale . Too bad Mr. Goda didn\u2019t have access to the bitcoin swap that Leo Group used to protect itself in its deal to buy a multi-million dollar Stradivarius. (Paul Vigna) - Lastly, it was nice to see the folks over at CoinDesk have a sense of humor. Ahead of the news today that China has officially banned its banks from operating in bitcoin, CoinDesk published an April Fool\u2019s Day piece, reporting that the \u201cCEO of Bitcoin,\u201d in fact, turned it around, and banned China.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $490.83, up 2.7% (via CoinDesk) \u2013Of Bitcoins, derivatives, and 18th-century stringed instruments.\xa0Remember that first-of-a-kind derivatives deal that Tera Group announced this week involving a swap contract priced in bitcoin?  Well, like everything in bitcoin, it turns out there\u2019s a story behind it: The deal involved the sale of a multimillion-dollar Stradivarius violin by Carpenter Violins of New York. The buyer, wealth management company Leo Group LLC, was sitting on bitcoins it had acquired over the past year \xa0and \xa0wanted to use them to buy the violin. This wasn\u2019t exactly an orthodox request for Carpenter Violins, owned by virtuoso sibling musicians Sean, Lauren and David Carpenter. What\u2019s more, there was plenty of money at stake and a lot of attention currently going on stringed instruments dating back to the famed Italian family of Stradivari artisans in the 18th\xa0century. (Sotheby\u2019s \xa0will in June auction a Stradivarius viola at a starting bid price of $45 million, setting it up to become become the most expensive musical instrument in history. That \u201cMacDonald Viola\u201d was played on Thursday at Sotheby\u2019s New York by David Carpenter.) \xa0LeoGroup would not disclose the price at which it purchased the related violin, only that it was a multimillion-dollar deal. With the price of bitcoin swinging wildly at the time of negotiations \u2013 bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was at that time careening toward bankruptcy \u2014 the sellers were understandably worried about the exchange rate risk over the period of the contract. So, LeoGroup turned to the Tera Group, which runs derivatives marketplaces and in which the wealth management firm holds a stake, to construct a swap deal to protect the parties from losses.\xa0 The contract was entered into on Feb. 27, the same day Mt. Gox announced its bankruptcy, and it settled in dollars on Monday this week. There was more to it than avoiding losses on an expensive artifact. LeoGroup and Tera were keen to establish a template for bitcoin derivatives that might one day trade on a regulated exchange such as Tera\u2019s swap execution facility, TeraExchange. So, the parties registered with the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission and sought to follow the regulator\u2019s standards for swaps, even though it was never formally given its stamp of approval. The deal now stands a \u201cprototype\u201d for future bitcoin swap contracts that seek to be regulated and openly traded, said LeoGroup Senior Managing Director Matthew Allain. How readily the CFTC will embrace such deals is unclear, however. CFTC spokesman Steven Adamske downplayed the significance of its involvement, describing its discussions about listing such swaps on the TeraExchange as \u201cpreliminary conversations.\u201d Still, with bitcoin\u2019s price refusing to settle down, the story highlights the growing interest among Wall Street\u2019s financial engineers to devise derivatives that might mitigate the risk associated with that volatility. Earlier this month, Princeton Digital Exchange launched PDEXtrading.com, an electronic platform for trading a simple form of bitcoin derivative known as binary options, contracts which give holders the right to buy or sell an asset if the price crosses a certain threshold.\xa0(Michael Casey) - Everybody\u2019s still trying to figure out exactly what the IRS notice from earlier this week means for bitcoin. Some thing it\u2019s good, some think it\u2019s bad, some see a mix of the two. The Bitcoin Foundation\xa0liked the mantle of legitimacy it provided, but bemoaned the cumbersome reporting requirements. Edmund Moy, the former director of the U.S. Mint who\u2019s become an outspoken proponent of digital currencies, saw a mix of good and bad as well, but ultimately he made two cogent points: first, that this is is a rule, not a law, and there\u2019s a difference, and, two, that it can be changed as circumstances warrant. \u201cWider acceptance of bitcoin, in spite of this speed bump, is one such circumstance that may force the IRS to reconsider its guidance,\u201d he said. To that end, the IRS itself is soliciting public comments on the notice, and it\u2019s very likely the rules will be tweaked at some point. (Paul Vigna) - Meanhile, Citi\u2019s Steven Englander, who\u2019s been writing about bitcoin quite a bit, said the IRS ruling \u201cmeans that the bitcoin libertarian epoch is pretty much over. Keeping track of transaction and paying capital gains (and even ordinary income taxes) is about as much inside the system as you can get.\u201d He also wonders if there\u2019s even a need for the decentralized ledger or miners \u201cif we have the IRS keeping track of transactions,\u201d and if people will hold bitcoin as an asset amid all these requirements. \u201cThe questions then are: what is the fair value of a bitcoin when consumers and businesses actually seek to avoid holding it as an asset?\u201d It\u2019s an open question, of course, and we\u2019ll have to wait to see. But the bottom line is that the IRS has not so much shifted the rules, but erected the first rules, and that is probably going to change things. (Paul Vigna) \u2013A mobile phone with a camera, and a driver\u2019s license or a passport: That\u2019s all customers of bitcoin exchanges, digital wallet providers and ATMs will need to automatically fulfill federal and state money-transmitter regulatory requirements if a new technology model sponsored by eight bitcoin businesses takes off. The eight firms \u2014 which includes bitcoin ATM provider BitAccess and digital-currency exchange CoinMkt \u2013 have formed the Bitcoin Identity Security Open Network, or BISON. They\u2019ve partnered with Jumio, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based credentials management tech company to embrace a system that reads and verifies the information contained in images that are scanned from a mobile phone camera shot of the drivers licenses and passports of over 100 countries.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $521.15, down 10% (via CoinDesk) \u2013Once again, bitcoin\u2019s price got suckered by vague stories of a regulatory crackdown in China.\xa0It dropped 10% in dollar terms Thursday after news spread that the country\u2019s central bank was going to stop banks from providing accounts to digital currency businesses. Trading as low as $512 on Thursday, bitcoin hit its lowest level since November. It\u2019s tempting for bulls to dismiss this as another unsubstantiated rumor designed to help someone who needs to buy bitcoins cheaply. But there are reasons to be more concerned about this one than, say, last Friday\u2019s similarly price-buffeting rumor that Chinese authorities were getting tough. For one, this story was reported by mainstream Chinese media such as Caixin Online as if it were fact, with details about a People\u2019s Bank of China document that has instructed banks to shut the accounts of 15 specific web sites by April 15. It could still be a rumor circulated by a nefarious actor \u2013 a false document, perhaps \u2013 but the details in the news report have people like Bobby Lee, BTC China Chief Executive Officer, worried that he\u2019ll have to deny customers direct fund deposits into their BTC China accounts. \u201cIf the rumor turns out to be true, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. That could kill volumes, much as it did when BTC China temporarily suspended direct deposits in response to a separate December PBOC ruling that sought to curtail bitcoin trading. If there\u2019s a silver lining for bitcoiners, it may be that Chinese authorities are being vague about this, which could mean the apparent policy change is reversible. The fact that the PBOC has not publicly acknowledged this document suggests that unlike its formal, publically pronounced policy changes, this move fits within the more stealthy, informal approach to policy that it employs from time to time. Under that model, it implements changes quietly via back-channel communications with the country\u2019s closely controlled banks. And since it\u2019s not formalized, the central bank can later roll back or modify those instructions. Indeed, that\u2019s what it appeared to do in January when PBOC officials used similar back channels to clarify that the December ban on bitcoin trading applied only to banks, not digital-currency exchanges. China appears to be walking a fine line with bitcoin. Its leaders want to rein in speculation in digital currencies, much as they worry about bubbles in real estate and \u201cshadow banking\u201d loans. But they\u2019re not banning bitcoin outright. Perhaps that\u2019s because they know that in the long run their increasingly globalized economy will have to embrace the groundbreaking technology behind it. (Michael Casey) - This week\u2019s diktat from the IRS regarding bitcoin, that it will be treated as \u201cproperty,\u201d not currency, for tax purposes, is \u201ca classic case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole,\u201d Bob Eisenbeis, vice chairman and chief monetary economist at Cumberland Advisors, wrote in a note. The ruling, he feels, won\u2019t settle the question of what bitcoin actually is, and at the same time, given bitcoin\u2019s nature, will merely drive activity to jurisdictions outside the IRS\u2019s reach. While the ruling provides some clarity, \u201cthe reality is that the ruling will only serve to increase costs to law-abiding U.S. taxpayers,\u201d due to the reporting requirements, and \u201calso ignores the international and extraterritorial aspects of virtual currencies, and will simply drive miners and most users offshore.\u201d The ruling, also, won\u2019t discourage malefactors, although it will raise their risks (as in, exposure to the taxman). Possibly the most ironic aspect of the ruling, Mr. Eisenbeis wrote, is that it misses one of the biggest benefits of virtual currencies: anonymity. \u201cThis raises the interesting question of who will actually be able to enforce the new IRS rulings.\u201d For the record, Mr. Eisenbeis notes that Cumberland has not placed any of its clients in bitcoin, \u201cnor will we. The risks and uncertainties are too great.\u201d (Paul Vigna) \u2013Icelanders now have a competitor to their embattled national currency, the krona.\xa0Auroracoin was officially launched this week with the so-called \u201cairdop\u201d allowing every one of Iceland\u2019s 330,000 citizens 31.8 units each of the new digital currency. So far, only 5.09% of the total 10.5 million aurorocoins have been claimed, according to the project\u2019s website \u2013 in other words, only 16,500 have submitted their national registry IDs to claim their portion. The rest of the 300,000 or so have another four months to sign on. Shortly after the airdrop began at midnight on Tuesday, auroracoin\u2019s price plunged from $12.84 to a low of $4.92 late Tuesday, according to coinmarketcap.com. This suggested that some of the new recipients decided that the best thing to do with their windfall was to turn it immediately back into traditional currency. By Wednesday morning, its price was back above $10 and it has since stabilized around $7.50. Even though auroracoin is a long way down from its peak of $92.78 on March 4, the total market capitalization of the coins at $66 million, puts its fourth in line for all digital currencies behind bitcoin, Ripple and litecoin. (Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts say Ripple\u2019s market cap is exaggerated because most of its coins are not in open circulation.) The real test is whether Icelanders start to use this new coin to trade stuff with each other.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $582.86, up 0.10% (via CoinDesk) \u2013Mt. Gox\u2019s embattled creditors had their hopes raised only to be abruptly dashed overnight. It began with the following tweet by a Turkish investment banker called Eren Canarslan in which he heralded news from the failed bitcoin exchange: Within a few days(or hours) @MtGox will announce that \u201cthey found ~670.000 #bitcoin & may release some BTCs to the victims. @PatronaPartners \u2014 Eren Canarslan (@CanarslanEren) March 25, 2014 His statement got people excited, not only because, if true, it would mean that all of the Mt. Gox\u2019s customers\u2019 missing 670,000 bitcoins could be returned to them, but also because he had earned himself some credibility by tweeting on March 4 that Mt. Gox had found bitcoin. Two weeks later that was followed by the announcement from the exchange that it had indeed found 200,000 coins it had previously assumed to have lost. Mr. Canarslan was not immediately available to comment for this article. Mt. Gox\u2019s burned customers lit up social media platforms Twitter and Reddit, some skeptical, others inclined to believe, all presumably clinging to some hope. And then, tantalizingly, word came of a new announcement from Mt. Gox Thursday morning in its home base of Tokyo. Alas, the statement was a letdown. The exchange announced only that it is cooperating with law enforcement to find the missing coins. No imminent announcement of a dramatic new discovery, it would seem. Not surprisingly, the tone on those Reddit and Twitter threads turned melancholy and angry. Mr. Canarslan became a target of complaints. (Michael J. Casey) - Patrick Byrne, chief executive of Overstock.com, said he didn\u2019t expect the new IRS guidelines on bitcoin to significantly raise the tax bill on the roughly $20,000 worth of bitcoin the web retailer receives each day from customers. That\u2019s because Overstock quickly converts the virtual currency it receives into dollars, so it is not likely to realize gains or losses from holding bitcoin. \u201cNone of this surprises me and actually it all seems fair,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. To the extent the rule require the company to file additional reports with the government, he said, \u201cIf that\u2019s what we have to do, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d \u201cWe expect the additional clarity will have a positive effect on the adoption of this new and novel method of payment,\u201d said Stephen Pair, co-founder of BitPay, a firm that helps retailers except bitcoin. (Ryan Tracy) \u2013The money keeps coming in for bitcoin-related ventures.\xa0Three digital currency-oriented businesses announced that they\u2019d raised a total of $23.5 million in equity financing between them. Circle Internet Financial, whose consumer platform will allow users to convert traditional currency into bitcoin and then use an account to send and receive bitcoins, said it had received an additional $17 million from venture capital investors. That brings its total raised to $26 million from investors such as Breyer Capital, Accel Partners, General Capital Partners, Oak Investment Partners and the\xa0Bitcoin\xa0Opportunity Fund. Meanwhile, Payward Inc. announced that its online digital-currency exchange, Kraken, raised $5 million from Hummingbird Ventures while GoCoin, a global processor of payments in digital currencies, said it secured $1.5 million from an investor group led by Bitcoin Shop and former Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Owen Van Natta. (Michael Casey) - Bitcoin ATMs are really getting around. Lamassu, the firm started by brothers Zach and Josh Harvey, says it expects to deliver at least one ATM to every continent save Antartica by May, according to an article in CoinDesk. The Harvey brothers have a place in our heart, being they were the subject of our first bitcoin story, last May. Back then, the brothers had only a prototype. It began taking orders last August, and is on track to ship 200 machines by this upcoming May. At $5,000 a pop, that\u2019s not so bad.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $581.17, down 0.9% (via CoinDesk) - The answer is: property.\xa0One of the biggest questions surrounding bitcoin got its first answer on Tuesday, from the powerful Internal Revenue Service, which declared that for tax purposes the digital currency is \u201cproperty,\u201d like any other capital asset, and not currency. With the April 15 deadline for filing taxes fast approaching, the IRS on Tuesday said it will treat bitcoin like property for taxes purposes, as opposed to a currency. This will be a boon for investors, because bitcoin will be taxed like other capital assets, and be subject to lower capital-gains taxes. The Journal\u2019s tax expert, Laura Saunders, did a Q&A that you can read here. The decision is similar to a ruling in the U.K., and is \u201cpretty consistent with what I expected to happen,\u201d said Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of bitcoin-financial services firm Circle. The ruling, essentially, is \u201canother way of saying it\u2019s a type of asset.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a positive step forward,\u201d he said, \xa0in that the IRS is tacitly acknowledging that bitcoin is a \u201clegitimate financial instrument, a taxable instrument.\u201d This is more about bitcoin as an investment, as opposed to, well, a currency. The rulings won\u2019t hinder bitcoin\u2019s use on a daily basis for simple purchases, according to Keith Aqui, the IRS staffer who wrote the notice. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have to worry,\u201d Mr. Aqui told MoneyBeat, referring to people using bitcoin to make regular purchases. If the digital currency isn\u2019t being held as an investment, he said, it won\u2019t be subject to property taxes. \u201cIt all depends upon your intent in holding onto the bitcoin.\u201d In other words, the next time you buy a slice at Lean Crust Pizza in Brooklyn (yes, they take bitcoin), you won\u2019t have to calculate the capital-gains tax on that purchase. (Paul Vigna) They say there\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity. So, in that sense the fact that all the drama and negative news surrounding bitcoin over the past few months has raised the digital currency\u2019s profile in Middle America is a good thing for bitcoiners in their push for its widespread adoption. But a new survey also points out the dangers of a wider public awareness. Pollster Harris Interactive canvassed 2,039 people around the U.S. on behalf of Yodlee, a provider of digital financial services, and found that although 48% have now heard of bitcoin, most of them don\u2019t trust it enough to invest in it. Only 13% said they would choose bitcoin as an investment over gold. The results also found that heightened awareness appeared to correlate with lower trust. Although respondents in western states proved more likely to have heard about bitcoin, they were also less likely than those in the South or Midwest to want to invest in it. Only 7% of Westerners who know what bitcoin is say they would invest in it over gold. The hope for bitcoin \u2014 as with everyone perhaps \u2014 lies with the young. More than twice as many Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 who are aware of bitcoin said they would prefer to invest in it over gold than those aged over 55, but even then the percentage was only 20% (versus 8% for the older group.) Bitcoin has come a long way since a survey in February by TheStreet found that only about 25% of Americans had even heard of it. But in the wake of Mt. Gox, the Silk Road scandal and the hoohah over the hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto, it clearly still has a big PR job to it. \xa0(Michael Casey) - Such Nascar, dogecoin. Good wow.\xa0We filed away last week something we saw on reddit: that the dogie\u2019s were trying to raise enough money to buy a Nascar sponsorship. Well, they did it. The dogecoin community raised $50,000 (67 million dogecoin) to buy a sponsorship with Nascar driver Josh Wise. The car will be \u201cprimarily dogecoin themed, and will also feature the reddit alien logo,\u201d according to a press release (the image above is a mock-up of the car, designed by a reddit user). Mr. Wise will first drive his, ah, dogecar\xa0(we just came up with that, for the record) at the Aarons 499 Sprint Cup race on May 4 at the Talladega Speedway in Florida. The dogies certainly get credit for the most creative use of a community. They\u2019ve previous raised money for clean wells in Kenya, and to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Sochi Olympics. The effort to get dogecoin on a car, though, is mainly about publicity. Fun publicity, of course, as just about everything with this group is.

Worse still for bitcoin is how the Internal Revenue Service will do it. The IRS said Tuesday it would treat bitcoin as property rather than currency.

Leave aside the paradox of a bitcoin pioneer filling out tax forms. The IRS\u2019s move highlights a bigger problem precisely because, unlike much of taxation, it makes sense. Bitcoin acts more like a speculative asset than a true currency. All readily tradable forms of money are speculative to a degree.

Bitcoin, with its relatively limited transactional use, wild fluctuations, and hype, hews more toward the speculative end\u2013more like a tech stock than money in your pocket.

Literally.\xa0Tera Group, which runs one of the new derivative exchanges called TeraExchange, announced on Monday morning that it will starting handling bitcoin derivatives swap agreements, in what it\u2019s saying is the first swap for the digital currency. This would give investors one way to hedge against the manic price swings that have been a staple of bitcoin in the last 15 months. It says something when an instrument like derivatives, which were so central in the Crash of 2008, could be seen as a ameliorating factor for bitcoin investing, but when you go from $13 to $1,100 and back to under $600, one thing is clear: that is not a ride most people\u2019s hearts can handle. Initially, it seems like Tera\u2019s offering is more like a beta version. It\u2019s going to trade off the firm\u2019s exchange, on the OTC market. Tera says it is seeking permission from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to offer them on its own, regulated market. If it gets regulatory approvals, it plans to move the swaps to its own exchange. That could be critical to the wider reliability of the swaps, since it was the completely unregulated derivatives market where so much damage was done before 2008\u2032s market collapse. Tera Group is among\xa0a new crop of derivatives exchanges that are forming in the wake of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. One of the stipulations was that derivatives contract, which previously were completely unregulated, needed to be moved to approved exchanges. - When you\u2019re bitcoin, and you\u2019ve had the year bitcoin has had, every little black eye gets magnified. Thus it was over the weekend, when the news mushroomed across the blogosphere that a tiny bitcoin exchange in China, Vircurex, was on the verge of collapse after freezing withdrawals, after hackers made off with digital assets. Sound familiar? It sounds a lot like the Mt. Gox story, the main difference being the size of the two firms. As PC World pointed out, Vircurex\xa0traded just 54 bitcoins over the past 30 days. Still, in the wider world, it doesn\u2019t matter that Vircurex is tiny, or that most people have never heard of it. Most people have never heard of bitcoin, for that matter, either. These days, salacious sells. - You can go around the world on bitcoin, and you can also now get to the top of the world. Mt. Everest Adventures, a hiking expedition company that runs trips up the famed mountain (as well as a variety of other adventurous trips), has starting accepting bitcoin for payment, according to a story in CoinDesk. It\u2019s not just a gimmick for the Australian company. Running trips to the world\u2019s rooftop in a foreign country draws an international crowd, so the idea of one digital currency that can be used across those borders has obvious appeal. Since the first ascent of the peak in 1953 by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary, the climb has gotten progressively more popular, and crowded. Nepalese officials just today announced they will start posting officials at base camp to control all the tourists. In case you were wondering, Mt. Everest is 29,029 feet above sea level. You might be better off spending your bitcoin at a Sacramento Kings game. California\u2019s capital is less than 100 feet above sea level.

A start-up derivatives exchange is working on what it claims will be the first bitcoin swap, allowing financial institutions to bet on the value of the embattled virtual currency. Tera Group Inc, operator of the exchange, said it has drafted documentation for a 25-day swap transaction between a pair of U.S. financial firms. The swap works by allowing the holder, say a vendor who accepts bitcoin as a method of payment, to protect against a potential drop in the virtual currency\u2019s value against the U.S. dollar. Under the swap\u2013known as a \u201cnon-deliverable\u201d forward because the contract is settled in cash without the need to deliver bitcoin\u2013the parties agreed to pay each other in the future a certain amount based on the values of the two currencies. The parties to the swap agreed to use an average price taken from multiple bitcoin exchanges to determine how they\u2019ll settle up. Tera declined to name the parties to the planned swap transaction, but said it should be complete within the next several weeks and would be transacted off Tera\u2019s platform as an unregulated financial contract. The contract comes as bitcoin proponents have pushed for the currency to bet used by mainstream investors in more regulated markets and to be used in day-to-day commerce. But bitcoin has recently suffered from wild price fluctuations and regulatory scrutiny that have threatened to dent its popularity among investors and other users. Tera is separately applying to the Commodity Futures Exchange Commission to list bitcoin derivatives on its regulated exchange. The CFTC already has a laundry list of to-dos as it brings swaps under its purview in the wake of the financial crisis, and grapples with a range of budgeting constraints. A CFTC spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Routine swaps were pushed onto open platforms resembling exchanges under the 2010 Dodd Frank financial overhaul law. Non-uniform transactions that could not be routed to clearinghouses were allowed to be transacted off of those platforms. The terms of the bitcoin swap will still have to be reported to regulators along with other swaps. Whatever happens to the value of the currency, the party seeking the hedge has locked in the value of bitcoin for the life of the swap.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $582.46, down 0.7% (via CoinDesk) - Bitcoin prices are dropping again on Friday. While the moves are not large \u2014 at least in bitcoin terms \u2014 they get attention when you see it falling further away from the $600 range where it had been comfortably sitting. The culprit appears to a news report, since refuted, that China was planning a bitcoin ban effective April 15. The price was above $600 two days ago, but has been sliding steadily; it traded as low as $563.46 today, according to CoindDesk\u2019s index, and is around $580 now. The report appeared on the Sina news service\u2019s website (you can see a translated version of it here), saying that the People\u2019s Bank of China would ban all bitcoin transactions on April 15. Of course, news like this spread quickly, with redditers posting, reporting and debating what it all meant (that was where we first saw reference to it). There\u2019s nothing on the Bank\u2019s English-language website, certainly, and as quickly as the news spread, the news that it wasn\u2019t really news spread as well. We called Sina\u2019s offices in California, but haven\u2019t heard back yet. Yes, this is one more example of why bitcoin trading is risky (and of course, will be a kind of selling point for folks like Barry Silbert and the Winkelvii who are developing bitcoin trust fund). We\u2019re talking about a relatively thin, illiquid market that can be and is moved by rumor and innuendo. On the other hand, the U.S. stock market is a huge, liquid market than can be and is moved by rumor and innuendo. Bitcoin\u2019s growth in China is hotly debated topic. You\u2019ve got an authoritarian regime controlling about a billion and a half people with a burgeoning middle class, and that is a perfect nesting ground for a disruption, stick-a-finger-in-the-eye, slippery, decentralized, libertarian technology like bitcoin. The People\u2019s Bank in December declared that bitcoin was not currency, and that put a dent in its growth there. It isn\u2019t clear how big that dent is, though. Bobby Lee, the CEO of BTC China, has been arguing that bitcoin is still growing in China. You can argue to the extent to which he is correct, but today\u2019s price moves make it clear that bitcoin still has a big interest in China. - Mark Karpeles apparently dug deep into the cushions of his couch and found $120 million in loose change. Or something like that. Mt. Gox, the now-bankrupt bitcoin exchange run by Mr. Karpeles, announced overnight that it found about 200,000 bitcoin in an \u201cold wallet,\u201d a storage filed it had not used since 2011. How the company could just not be aware of $120 million worth of bitcoin is certainly surprising. But it at least provides Gox\u2019s customers that they may recover something after all. The find lowers the amount of bitcoin lost from 850,000 to 650,000, although the company didn\u2019t specify if the found bitcoin belonged to customers or the exchange itself. - Bill Miller was a darling in the equities markets for years, a Legg Mason mutual fund manager who had an impressive streak of beating the S&P 500 for 15 years running.

Gox have launched an elaborate plan to get some of their crypto-currency back after gaining court approval Thursday. A federal judge on Thursday signed off on the proposal to find hidden assets of the Mt. Gox chief executive Mark Karpeles, after an unusual court hearing that included calling for testimony from the public in attendance. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a sting,\u201d said U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman, with a grin, as lawyers presented their plan to trace what they allege are illegal transfers of bitcoin by Tokyo-based Mt. Gox\u2019s CEO, Mark Karpeles. Mr. Karpeles didn\u2019t respond to an e-mailed request for comment. Mt. Gox collapsed in February after 850,000 bitcoins valued at more than $500 million at current prices were lost from its digital coffers. Judge Feinerman ordered Mr. Karpeles\u2019s U.S. assets frozen a little more than a week ago. The exchange has filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan. The current suit, has yet to be certified as a class action, but the judge and plaintiffs lawyers are proceeding with the understanding that it will be. The plaintiffs are looking to recover as many funds as possible from Mt. Gox and related defendants including Mr. Karpeles. At first, Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing clients who lost money in the collapse, asked to present his plan to the judge in chambers. Judge Feinerman asked the public and the media in the audience about the wisdom of undertaking part of the trial in a non-public setting. A reporter in attendance, who happens to be a former lawyer, made a convincing case to not take the case to chambers. Judge Feinerman eventually decided to hear Mr. Edelson\u2019s plan in open court. Mr. Edelson alleges that Tibanne Co., the parent company of Mt. Gox, has ignored a temporary restraining order and has been attempting to move U.S-held bitcoin to multiple accounts, including one holding hundreds of thousands of bitcoins with a value of millions of dollars. Both companies were founded by Mr. Karpeles. Mr. Edelson said unspecified amounts of bitcoins are being moved, sometimes in fractions of a single bitcoin, into multiple accounts overseas. \u201cAre we expecting defense council to show up?\u201d asked Judge Feinerman. No one did, and the defense table sat empty throughout the proceedings. Mr. Edelson proposed tracing the flow of these bitcoins by following the movements of a small amount of the digital currency, which they said likely belongs to Mr. Karpeles, via Tibanne Co. into one of Mr. Karpeles\u2019s accounts. \u201cWe want to let Tabanne move the assets so we can trace them,\u201d said Mr. Edelson. He reasoned that Mr. Karpeles and Tibanne Co, \u201chave no idea of the .001% of what they are doing,\u201d so a small transaction being traced would go unnoticed. By working with unspecified \u201cthird parties,\u201d which probably facilitate bitcoin trades and think they have been asked to move it illegally on behalf of Mr. Karpeles, lawyers said they think they can get enough information to find Mr. Karpeles\u2019 main stash as he consolidates his deposits. Judge Feinerman approved the plan, allowing his restraining order to be lifted on some trades that include fractions of a bitcoin. One bitcoin is currently valued at about $600. The judge also set the next major trial date for April 9, at which time the temporary restraining order will expire and he will decide the next step to be taken in the case.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $592.55, down 2.7% (via CoinDesk) - The price of bitcoin has been surprisingly stable lately, no small feat for something so notoriously volatile. Since falling under $500 in the immediate aftermath of Mt. Gox\u2019s late-February collapse, bitcoin prices have been sitting \u2013 alomst boringly \u2013 in a fairly tight band between $600 and about $635. So our doge ears snapped up when we noticed the price drop under $600 this morning. Figuring out exactly why bitcoin prices are rising or falling isn\u2019t so easy. If you want to find a 50-day or 200-day moving average, you can do that, but there isn\u2019t a deep well of technical analysis out there. You can trawl through reddit, but (and no offense, redditers) you\u2019re as likely to get a wild conspiracy theory as a fundamental reason. Being proper market reporters, we did what we always do when we see an asset\u2019s price rise or fall: we called an analyst, in this case, Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. He didn\u2019t put too much into today\u2019s drop. The move isn\u2019t about any specific news, he said; basically, it\u2019s just about more sellers than buyers (an old Wall Street saw). \u201cThere\u2019s going to be these kinds of movements based on supply and demand.\u201d Part of the volatility is simply the market trying to figure out exactly what a bitcoin should be worth, and that\u2019s not going to be perfectly clear until it\u2019s clear what exactly bitcoin\u2019s going to be. \u201cWe view the recent price volatility in bitcoin prices a result of extended price discovery,\u201d Mr. Luria wrote in a report. But he noted that the price has been relatively calm lately, and that calm has \u201chelped people get over their bitcoin phobia,\u201d he said. People aren\u2019t investing in just the coin itself, they\u2019re investing in bitcoin businesses, and price stability gives them more confidence. This trend, investments in bitcoin-related businesses rather than just the currency, is a key development, Mr. Luria thinks. Wedbush, you may recall, began selling its bitcoin-related research on its website, and accepting bitcoin for payment. The experiment has been \u201csurprisingly good,\u201d Mr. Luria said. They\u2019ve sold a few dozen reports, and shown the community that they\u2019re \u201cnot scared\u201d of bitcoin, that they\u2019re involved in it, and they\u2019ve even been contacted by regulators. \u201cIt accomplished our goal.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin keeps making inroads into pop culture.\xa0The latest thing we saw (h/t, reddit) is word that the Toronto electro hip-hop band Ain\u2019t No Love is distributing its 2013 EP, Tears of Joy, on the file-sharing site Frostwire, with the twist that it\u2019s accepting tips in bitcoin. \u201cA main goal of ours is to stay current and progressive, and I\u2019m talking sonically,\u201d said rapper Roland Broere, 23 years old, who goes by the stage name 1990. \u201cBecause bitcoin is this new progressive form of finance, it was a metaphor to me.\u201d \u201cTo be honest, I had no idea what bitcoin was,\u201d said lead singer Saidah Conrad, also 23; she learned it three days ago. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around it,\u201d she acknowledged, but was encouraged by the response so far. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to kind of understanding a bit more about how it works.\u201d Ain\u2019t No Love isn\u2019t the first to use bitcoin for music sales; former Spice Girl Melanie Brown sold a single on her website via bitcoin. The combination of bitcoin with a bittorrent site sounds like one of these industry-rattling ideas. But Roland thinks the bitcoin world is too small to put any dent into the current system. This is just an experiment, he said. Still, the band is pleased with the response it\u2019s seen so far, and is open to experimenting further. So far the band was pleased with the response to the offer, and are open to further experiments with bitcoin, although Roland think it\u2019s still too small a market to have any real effect on the way records are distributed.

Mr. Okubo, a Democratic Party of Japan upper house lawmaker, said he believes bitcoin or whatever succeeds it will have the potential to change how the financial industry works. The failure of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox in February was \u201cunfortunate,\u201d but he said Japan should take the chance to be a front-runner on this issue. \u201cWe should tackle the Mt. Gox case head-on and think how we should legally deal with bitcoin,\u201d Mr. Okubo said during an interview. \u201cIt is our chance to legislate virtual currencies before anyone else does.\u201d A former Morgan Stanley Securities managing director, the 53-year-old lawmaker with the largest opposition party sent two letters to the cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, asking for the government\u2019s understanding of issues related to the crypto-currency, such as money laundering and taxation, under the current legal framework. He said the purpose of the letters was to create a cautionary list, or a list of things not to do in order to prevent the type of problems that could arise from a currency that exists outside of the world\u2019s existing foreign exchange framework. Mr. Okubo said such a move is essential so that the general public can use virtual currencies safely. Much to Mr. Okubo\u2019s disappointment, the government responded in writing that it doesn\u2019t consider bitcoin a currency and didn\u2019t define what it considers it to be, leaving advocates wondering which ministry in Japan would be responsible for oversight. On other issues such as money laundering, anti-fraud measures and licensing when running exchanges in Japan, the government\u2019s answers avoided clear responses. \u201cI don\u2019t care if bitcoin is a currency or not,\u201d Mr. Okubo said. \u201cConsidering how we can prevent money laundering, fraud and other possible misuses of the technology, it\u2019s best if Japan clearly states whether bitcoin is a financial instrument or a derivative product,\u201d Mr. Okubo said, implying the Financial Services Agency should pick up the ball. Experts and industry members have been hoping that the FSA would play a role in regulating virtual currency exchanges in Japan. Karl-Friedrich Lenz, a professor of German and European law at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, said the FSA must take resposibility because the exchanges take currency deposits. People close to the collapsed Mt. Gox, which at its peak enjoyed more than 80% of the total market volume, also said it will be easier and safer for exchanges and users if the financial watchdog takes a governing role. In the U.S., the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Treasury, is encouraging bitcoin companies to register as a money-services businesses\u2013meaning they follow anti-money-laundering rules. Several state regulators are also clamping down. In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore put bitcoin under its purview, saying the nation is \u201cone of the first countries in the world to regulate virtual-currency intermediaries.\u201d Japan\u2019s FSA, meanwhile, has been emphasizing bitcoin isn\u2019t a currency. Illustrating the agency\u2019s derisive view of bitcoin, one high-ranking bureaucrat described the virtual currency in very unflattering terms when briefing ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers this month. \u201cMt. Gox says it is an exchange, but it\u2019s not an exchange in the traditional sense\u2026Rather, it is like online auction sites and bitcoin is more like trading cards that children play with.\u201d Mr. Okubo disagrees with such an approach. Referring to Mr. Abe\u2019s goal of making Japan one of the world\u2019s strongest financial centers by 2020, he said: \u201cthe opportunity has presented itself here but bureaucrats are not making a move.\u201d If the government isn\u2019t willing to act on something like this, then Mr. Abe\u2019s goal is \u201cjust pie in the sky,\u201d he adds.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mochi_wsj', 'name': 'Takashi Mochizuki', 'twitterhandle': '@mochi_wsj', 'email': 'Takashi Mochizuki'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/20/lawmaker-thinks-japan-should-be-bitcoin-leader/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 20, 3, 32), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Lawmaker Thinks Japan Should Be Bitcoin Leader'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto-current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J.

The company began taking orders for its first scrypt rig, called the Titan, on Wednesday. In four hours, according to a company representative, it received $2 million worth of orders. At $10,000 a rig ($9,995 to be precise) that\u2019s 200 machines. The company has plans to build 2,500 in its initial run. That\u2019s significant for a company that had $45 million in sales in 2013 (the company formed in April). \u201cThe Scrypt mining market has grown over the last six months and we have been watching it very closely,\u201d the company wrote on its website. \u201cThe time is now right for the launch of our new offering.\u201d While it\u2019s a significant number for KnCMiner itself, it also speaks to the growing interest in the so-called altcoins. The amount of people pouring into the bitcoin mining game has increased the difficulty there (the bitcoin algorithm is designed in such a way that as the amount of people mining increases, the difficulty increases as well). This is apparently leading prospectors into the altcoin space, where it\u2019s much cheaper to mine for coins. (Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin 0.9.0 has arrived. Even with plenty of folks tout the so-called \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033 era, bitcoin\u2019s core developers today released a new version of the protocol, what they\u2019re calling bitcoin 0.9.0, according to a report in CoinDesk. While it involves a bunch of tweaks and updates, the most significant change is a fix for the \u201ctransaction malleability\u201d issues that first came to the fore when Mt. Gox blamed the bug for its trading shutdown. It later became apparent that malefactors were exploiting the bug, which shut down trading on all the major bitcoin exchanges for the better part of a week. The new version of the protocol closes some of the gaps, but core developer Mike Hearn said \u201cit\u2019s not finished by any means.\u201d If you want to download 0.9.0, go here. (Paul Vigna) - Only in the cryptocurrency world could New York and San Francisco be considered frontier markets, but that\u2019s how the two major U.S. cities look in a press release from BitPay. The firm, which provides bitcoin-related services for merchants, is opening offices in both San Francisco and New York. These offices will act as extensions of the company\u2019s Atlanta headquarters, but will be staffed very thinly: the San Fran office will have two employees, the New York office will have one. Including the new staffers, the company will have 31 full-time employees: 22 in Atlanta, six in Argentina, two in San Francisco and one in New York. (Paul Vigna) - We know that bitcoin is a topic of interest on Wall Street. Apparently it is in the City, too. Mankoff Company is hosting a panel discussion on April 3 in London, at the Washington Mayfair Hotel, about bitcoin and the effects of cryptocurrencies as they move into the finanical community. It\u2019s an \u201cafter the bell\u201d affair, and speakers include Garrick Hileman of the London School of Economics, Emmanuel Abiodun, CEO of Cloudhashing.com, and Ian Grigg of Dinero Ltd.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $622.73, down 1.3% (via CoinDesk) - Dorian Nakamoto, the California man Newsweek says is the creator of bitcoin, may finally get his peace and quiet back. Mr. Nakamoto issued a no-doubt-about-it statement saying he did not create bitcoin (delivered by the lawyer he hired), he never heard of bitcoin before all this, he didn\u2019t have the technical background to develop a cryptocurrency, and he just wanted to be left alone. Here is the text of the letter: My name is Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. I am the subject of the Newsweek\xa0story on Bitcoin. I am writing this statement to clear my name. I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny\xa0the Newsweek report. The first time I heard the term \u201cbitcoin\u201d was from my son in mid-February\xa02014. After being contacted by a reporter, my son called me and used the word,\xa0which I had never before heard. Shortly thereafter, the reporter confronted me at my\xa0home. I called the police. I never consented to speak with the reporter. In an\xa0ensuing discussion with a reporter from the Associated Press, I called the technology\xa0\u201cbitcom.\u201d I was still unfamiliar with the term. My background is in engineering. I also have the ability to program. My\xa0most recent job was as an electrical engineer troubleshooting air traffic control\xa0equipment for the FAA. I have no knowledge of nor have I ever worked on\xa0cryptography, peer to peer systems, or alternative currencies. I have not been able to find steady work as an engineer or programmer for ten\xa0years. I have worked as a laborer, polltaker, and substitute teacher. I discontinued\xa0my internet service in 2013 due to severe financial distress. I am trying to recover from prostate surgery in October 2012 and a stroke I suffered in October of 2013.\xa0My prospects for gainful employment has been harmed because of Newsweek\u2019s\xa0article. Newsweek\u2019s false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and\xa0stress for myself, my 93-year old mother, my siblings, and their families. I offer my\xa0sincerest thanks to those people in the United States and around the world who have offered me their support. I have retained legal counsel. This will be our last public\xa0statement on this matter. I ask that you now respect our privacy. Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto\nTemple City, California\nMarch 17, 2014 \n He makes several key points, none more so than his work background. Creating a digital currency from scratch, one based upon a cryptographical protocol to boot, requires some familiarity with those worlds, but Dorian said he doesn\u2019t have any. Is it possible that he\u2019s lying to throw people off the trail? Well, sure, we reckon. But after this Newsweek is going to have to come up with something further to prove its story. They haven\u2019t made any statements today, and have previously defended the piece. Emails sent to their media office on Monday did not get a reply. UPDATE:\xa0Newsweek released a brief statement on its website: \u201cNewsweek has not received any statement or letter from either Mr. Nakamoto or his legal counsel. If and when we do, we will respond as necessary.\u201d It isn\u2019t clear where this story goes from here; Mr. Nakamoto\u2019s lawyer, Ethan Kirschner, confirmed the letter but declined to comment further. We\u2019ll say this, though: you don\u2019t hire a lawyer to write press releases. In any case, he may end up with something out of the whole ordeal no matter what else he does. Andreas Antonopoulos, the chief security officer at Blockchain, started a relief fund for Dorian, and it\u2019s up to about 46 BTC, which is roughly speaking about $29,000. \u201cYou deserve this Dorian\u201d wrote one of the donors (who gave 0.01 BTC, about $6) in a public message on the blockchain. (Paul Vigna) - Before Mt. Gox blew up and the whole Dorian circus started, one of the steadier streams of news in the bitcoin world was finding out which merchants were starting to accept the digital currency. There\u2019s been a number of them, from Overstock to the Sacramento Kings. But it\u2019s one thing to start taking bitcoin, it\u2019s another to have it make an actual difference in your business. CoinDesk is running an online poll to help answer the latter. This is the first large-scale poll on this topic it\u2019s done, and it wants to know what percentage of sales are coming from bitcoin, if merchants are happy accepting bitcoin, and if they\u2019d recommend it to others. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what they say. (Paul Vigna)\xa0 - Among the big \u201cwhite shoe\u201d Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley is the only one that hasn\u2019t\xa0issued some kind of report or opinion on bitcoin, and CEO James Gorman went so far as to call it \u201csurreal.\u201d The firm is aware of \xa0the digital currency, however. The firm is hosting a panel talk at its Times Square headquarters on Thursday organized by the MicroFinance Club of New York. Marco Santori, a business attorney, Juan Llanos, co-founder of Unidos Financial Services, and Rik Willard, co-founder of MintCombine, will be making presentations. The topic is how digital currencies can affect the global remittances and the so-called underbanked. The event is free for members of the club, and Morgan Stanley employees, and $15 for nonmembers.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $628.40, down 1.5% (via CoinDesk) - Should bitcoin take an upper- or lowercase \u201cB\u201d?\xa0If you\u2019re in the words business, it\u2019s not an idle question, and the answer to the question actually helps address that other question, what exactly is bitcoin? You all remember the rule, right? Proper nouns take an uppercase letter, common nouns take a lowercase letter. So, for \u201cGravity,\u201d the movie, you\u2019d use an uppercase \u201cG\u2019,\u201d but for gravity, the scientific concept, you\u2019d use a lowercase \u201cg.\u201d Therefore, how do you characterize bitcoin? Is it a specific thing, such that it would take an uppercase B, or a general, common thing, in which case it gets the lowercase g? Goldman Sachs (capital G, capital S), weighed in on the topic in its report this week. \u201cBitcoin with a capital \u2018B\u2019 is a peer-to-peer network that allows for the proof and transfer of ownership without the need for a trusted third party. The unit of that network is bitcoin with a little \u2018b.\u2019 \u201d That uppercase/lowercase guidance, for the record, was Wall Street Journal style \u2014 until last month. \u201cWe now spell\xa0bitcoin\xa0lowercase, all the time, for the electronic cash system, its network or the virtual currency itself. The plural is\xa0bitcoins,\u201d\xa0our style magistrates wrote\xa0on Feb. 28. In that sense, bitcoin is more like other currencies, which all get lowercased: the dollar, the euro, the yen, the yuan. It helps us. We\u2019d been adhering to the old style for BitBeat, but it was cumbersome. You\u2019re writing about the two so often, and so often in the same space, that it gets to looking very clumsy. We were thankful for the lowercase ruling. It also helps define bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a single, specific Thing. It\u2019s not a Mac, or a Camaro, or \u201cThe Elements of Style.\u201d It\u2019s more diffuse than that. Bitcoin is a multi-faceted, dispersed, decentralized thing.\xa0It is everywhere, under no single entity\u2019s control, like computers and cars and books. Somehow we think that should make the acolytes happy. (Paul Vigna) - Bill Harper, the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s new Washington liaison, penned a revealing blog post for the Foundation\u2019s web site.\xa0The Cato Institute fellow described himself as \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 a libertarian, but he went to great lengths to emphasize that the real promise of bitcoin lies in empowering the poor. To us it seemed like a deft way to appeal to both sides of Washington\u2019s divided politics. In that sense, Mr. Harper\u2019s opening salvo reflects a new phase in the digital currency\u2019s tumultuous journey from fringe to mainstream as the bitcoin industry strives to convince lawmakers and regulators to look beyond the recent spate of alarming headlines and focus instead on the social benefits of a groundbreaking technology. (Michael Casey) - We\u2019ve noticed that the law profession is taking a bigger interest in bitcoin.\xa0Increasingly, we see lawyers talking about bitcoin, and we hear from a lot of lawyers who want to talk about bitcoin. Broadly, it seems like there are two reasons: one, the whole idea just fires their imagination, the prospect of helping to shape an entirely new thing (lowercase t). On the other hand, the industry has been struggling since the Panic of 2008; they\u2019re eager for new business. What sparked us on this tangent was this post from the Credit Slips blog\xa0(sent along by our colleague Emily Glazer). It deals with a little-known corner of commercial law called Article 9, and it questions whether bitcoin, if it is not a currency (and under current law, it isn\u2019t), can be called collateral against business loans, giving creditors a claim on any bitcoin that pass through a business. We don\u2019t have the answer to that question\u2013nobody does yet\u2013but it shows how the legal industry is starting to tackle all the questions that are going to be raised by digital currencies.

Mr. Harper described himself in a blog post on the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s web site as a libertarian. No surprise there \u2013 he was the director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, a mainstay of libertarian thought among Washington think tanks. But his arguments in favor of bitcoin revealed what seemed to be a bipartisan bent to his lobbying efforts, one that embraces both the free-market traditions of the Republican base and \xa0Democratic priorities on social inclusion. \u201cMy personal philosophy is libertarian. That means a lot of things, and the opportunity for worldwide advancement of liberty is definitely one of things that got me engaged with Bitcoin. But what really excites me\u2014what tugs at my heartstrings\u2014is Bitcoin\u2019s potential to improve global financial inclusion. There are billions of people who, through no fault of their own, can\u2019t access formal financial services, so they have a harder time earning, a harder time saving, a harder time feeding their families, and a harder time educating their children. Why on earth, in this day and age, should anyone be \u201cexcluded\u201d from participating in economic activity that improves their lives?\u201d And while Mr. Harper raised the problem of inflation \u2013 a traditional bugaboo of bitcoiners and other opponents of government-issued fiat currencies \u2013 it was its impact on the poor, rather than its harm to wealthy Americans\u2019 savings that got his attention: \u201cI also find galling the effect of inflation on the poor. Smarties like you and I can invest our way out of inflation\u2019s gravitational pull, but even in rich countries, inflation acts as a constant drain on what wealth the poor and under-educated can pull together.\u201d Mr. Harper even gave a nod to those who argue that governments should manage the money supply, albeit while presenting them with a challenge: \u201cI understand the argument that money supplies should be managed, and that they can be managed well. All I need is for people holding that position to accept an empirical test: Let Bitcoin compete.\u201d All up, the post had the hallmarks of the pragmatism of an old Washington hand. At a time when bitcoin\u2019s reputation has been tarnished by bad news \u2013 from the arrest of alleged money launderers to the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange \u2013 leaders of the emerging bitcoin business community are increasingly talking about the need for sensible regulation to bolster confidence among the general public. It\u2019s something of a departure from \u2013 though not a complete repudiation of \u2014 the vigorously laissez-faire arguments pushed by many of the hardline libertarians who were early adopters of the digital currency. As for making bitcoin stronger, he\u2019s also taking a realistic approach that seems to eschew the more fanatical defense of those members of the bitcoin community who\u2019ve refuse to countenance suggestions it might have flaws. He said he is working on a \u201cstudy of the risks that Bitcoin faces and their severity, how to address them and, when possible, how to measure success or failure.\u201d This study will be presented at the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s annual conference in Amsterdam in May, he said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Dogecoin, the alt-coin launched in December and based on an Internet meme built on top of an Internet meme, has a noisy, loyal, and active fan base. They\u2019re fun-loving, in a good way, and they\u2019re working very diligently to build dogecoin into not only a digital currency, but, to put it in comic book terms, a force for good in this world. In only a few months of existence, it has become the sixth-biggest alt-coin by market cap. It was hard to take them seriously at first, with the coin launching around the time of the whole Kanyecoin joke, but they\u2019re being taken seriously now. GoCoin, a payments platform for digital currencies, said it will now support dogecoin payments, in addition to bitcoin and litecoin. When it comes to currencies, \u201ccommunity is everything,\u201d said Brock Pierce, GoCoin\u2019s co-founder and chairman. \u201cAnd Dogecoin\u2019s community is substantially larger than anything other than bitcoin. We adopt currencies based on demand. And when demand is there and the community is asking for it and merchants are asking for\u2026we\u2019ll make this a priority and implement it.\u201d Mr. Pierce said GoCoin\u2019s analysis of the dogecoin community revealed a demographic very different from bitcoin\u2019s, including many more women and less-tech-oriented users. He believes this in part stems from dogecoin\u2019s logo, containing the image of a shiba inu dog, which he said \u201cjust made it friendly.\u201d In a nod to that beloved dogecoin mascot, GoCoin included its face in its own logo on Thursday\u2019s press release. Another factor behind dogecoin\u2019s appeal, Mr. Pierce said, was its emphasis on philanthropy rather than get-rich-quick schemes. An example of that:\xa0dogecoiners are now seeking to raise money for drought relief in Kenya. These guys really do seem to be about having fun and doing good. Much good, dogecoin. News is big real. So hip. (Paul Vigna, Michael Casey) -Singapore is regulating bitcoin. But in the post-Gox era, that\u2019s seen as a quite a good thing \xa0\u2013 at least in the eyes of a bitcoin business community eager to convince a skeptical general public about the appeal of this digital currency. The libertarian trailblazers who \xa0first drove bitcoin\u2019s growth are unlikely to \xa0feel at ease with new laws of any kind, but the Singapore-based businesses we spoke to are all upbeat. The city-state\u2019s move to enforce anti-money laundering rules reflects its desire to embrace and normalize the technology, they say, much as it has done with other innovations. (Michael Casey) In the News: - The flap over the Newsweek story has died down for the moment.\xa0The magazine says Dorian is Satoshi, Dorian says he\u2019s not Satoshi. Satoshi says Dorian is not Satoshi, unless Dorian is secretly Satoshi saying publicly that he is not Satoshi to throw everybody off the trail. It can all get confusing. The editors over at Priceonomics went back to the start, to the original Newsweek article, and edited it as if it had been submitted to them. \u201cAs we read the article at Priceonomics, we cringed a bit,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAt Priceonomics, a lowly blog, we never would have published the\xa0Newsweek\xa0article in that form. If one of our writers wrote what Newsweek did, an editor would have hacked it to bits.\u201d The team at Newsweek said last week that reporting for the controversial piece \u201cwas conducted under the same high editorial and ethical standards that have guided\xa0Newsweek\xa0for more than 80 years.\u201d You decide. (Paul Vigna) - Team Coco doesn\u2019t get bitcoin, but it gets that it\u2019s worth putting on the air. Earlier this week, Conan O\u2019Brien did a bit (no pun intended, that\u2019s what they call it in the business) on bitcoin, in which the \u201cchief operating officer of Bitcoin\u201d attempted to answer the question, what is bitcoin? Now, of course, the guy, after saying it\u2019s \u201cquite simple,\u201d gave a lot of techno-babble answers, quoted \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d and played a nonsense video, increasingly infuriating O\u2019Brien because he couldn\u2019t simply answer the question (they should\u2019ve been reading BitBeat, but that\u2019s beside the point). It\u2019s pretty much classic farce. The reason it deserves mention here, beyond the fact that we\u2019re partial to O\u2019Brien and thought it was funny, is that it\u2019s one more example of how bitcoin is penetrating into mainstream culture. O\u2019Brien\u2019s show straddles a line between edgy and mainstream, it\u2019s more Laugh-In than Lawrence Welk. But it is a national television show. Bitcoin is as much a cultural movement as a technological one. This is another example of the former.

So, now that the city-state has announced it will regulate digital currencies, what\u2019s the bitcoin business community\u2019s response? Mostly positive, it seems. That may be a sign that, in the wake of the spectacular collapse of Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, those in the industry trying to bring bitcoin into the mainstream are eager for regulations that establish clear ground rules\xa0 for virtual currencies. And Singapore\u2019s announcement fits that bill. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it will require dealers that buy, sell or facilitate the exchange of virtual currencies for fiat currencies\u2013such as the U.S. or Singapore dollars\u2013\u201dto verify the identities of their customers and report suspicious transactions.\u201d They aren\u2019t the first to make such moves. The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, has said it will require exchanges and brokers to pursue money transmitter licenses, which require similar customer surveillance commitments. The same \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d and anti-money laundering rules are expected to be integrated into a special \u201cbit-license\u201d that New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services is creating. Whereas early adopters of bitcoin, many of whom hail from libertarian backgrounds, were initially drawn to the digital currency\u2019s Wild West-like trading experience, a string of negative developments \u2013 from the arrests of big users of bitcoin associated with the Silk Road illicit drug-trading site to the Mt. Gox collapse \u2013 have changed the calculus. Many bitcoin business leaders are now keen to resolve the legal uncertainty, as they want to give skeptical businesses and consumers more confidence that they can transact and invest in this newfangled creation. Clearly, though, these business interests would much prefer accommodating approaches such as Singapore\u2019s over draconian responses, like that of Russia, where authorities responded to bitcoin\u2019s rise by announcing that currencies other than the ruble were illegal. Singapore\u2019s move \u201cis a very positive development,\u201d said Brock Pierce, co-founder and chairman of GoCoin, a global digital currency payments processor headquartered in Singapore. He said that for GoCoin and other Singapore-based bitcoin businesses that have \u201calready implemented best practices around these activities,\u201d the new rules around customer compliance will have no impact. Singapore has a reputation for excessive regulation in some areas \u2013 think of its ban on chewing gum \u2013 but in areas of technological development where it sees value for the city-state\u2019s future growth, it has embraced a much softer touch. It\u2019s a posture that harks back to the free-trade principles behind its decades-long role as a major shipping port and trade hub. Bitcoiners believe Singapore is taking a similar view of the groundbreaking technology behind digital currencies. \u201cSingapore is a fascinating country in terms of what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish in the last 50 years and it\u2019s because of decisions like this, which show they understand innovation and choose to embrace it with sensible regulation,\u201d said GoCoin\u2019s Mr. Pierce in an interview. Atlas ATS CEO Shawn Solves, whose company this week launched a globally integrated high-tech digital-currency exchange for institutional investors in conjunction with Wall Street-focused telecommunications provider Perseus Telecom, said he was heartened by the news of Singapore\u2019s regulatory step. Atlas, which is actively promoting its strict compliance with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules, had set up a banking relationship in Singapore and planned to provide co-located trading operations there as well as in Hong Kong and New York. However, \u201cwe were uncomfortable operating in a vacuum in Singapore without some sort of guidelines and policy,\u201d Mr. Solves said in an interview. \u201cSo, we welcome this.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$636.05, up 1.13% (via\xa0CoinDesk) - It\u2019s been just a few weeks since CoinDesk dumped Mt. Gox from its bitcoin price index, but it already has found a new exchange to take its place. The London-based bitcoin news provider plans to announce on Thursday that it is adding Bitfinex to its price index, which currently includes Bitstamp of Slovenia and BTC-e of Bulgaria. Bitfinex is incorporated in Hong Kong. \u201cOver the past several weeks, and particularly since the decline of Mt. Gox, we have observed that Bitfinex has been able to sustain a dramatic increase in its share of the total volume of U.S. dollar-denominated bitcoins traded,\u201d according to a CoinDesk statement. (Robin Sidel) - The next generation of exchanges will look nothing like Mt. Gox. \xa0We report that Perseus Telecom, which installs super-fast high bandwidth lines linking traditional securities exchanges to the trade execution platforms of financial institutions, is teaming up with bitcoin exchange Atlas ATS to launch a global trading platform for the digital currency. The target market is not your guy in pajamas trading from his living room; it\u2019s high-volume, sophisticated investment firms. In terms of regulatory compliance, security features and the closed-nature of the dedicated network on which it runs, this exchange will look much more like those that Wall Street uses to trade stocks and bonds than the ones we associate with bitcoin trading now. And in case you thought the Mt. Gox debacle and other scandals were scaring traders away from bitcoin, it\u2019s worth nothing that Perseus and Atlas have been encouraged to enter this business by clients in the high-frequency trading sector. That would suggest that volumes are going to rise by a lot more yet. No guarantee it will solve the volatility problem, though. (Michael Casey) - Goldman Sachs has weighed in on bitcoin.\xa0Bitcoiners can be proud that the buzz they\u2019ve generated has not only gotten a reaction from a Wall Street icon that many of them love to hate but that it has come in the form of a full 25-page report. Whether they can be pleased with its conclusions is another matter. That depends on whether they\u2019re drawn to the digital currency out of hope it will replace the dollar and other fiat currencies as the primary means of exchange and store of value or whether they\u2019re excited by the underlying technology\u2019s promise as a payments system. For the first group, Goldman is pretty adamant that their hopes are exaggerated. The title of an article in the report penned by Goldman Sachs Markets analysts Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua is blunt: \u201cIs bitcoin a currency? No.\u201d Bitcoin is simply too volatile to function as a store of value, they say, citing one of the properties used to define a successful currency. But as a payments system, Messrs. Wilson and Ursua \u2013 as well as other contributors to the report \u2013 are more admiring. In theory, the cost savings in peer-to-peer bitcoin payment transfers over traditional payments could run to more than $100 billion per year, writes Goldman Sachs IT Services equity analyst Roman Leal. But he and others also note that new costs associated with security and bitcoin intermediaries could reduce that amount significantly. In sum, Uncle Sam should not be worried, but this bitcoin thing should give Mastercard and Western Union something to think about. \xa0(Michael Casey) - What happens to bitcoin if the Internet goes down?\xa0A\xa0post from Garth Kiser over at the blog Pursuing Nothing caught our eye. Mr. Kiser is clearly an enthusiast for bitcoin, which he calls a \u201cmonumental leap towards a peer-governed future,\u201d but he worries about how the distributed network that runs its core infrastructure would handle a major disruption to the Internet. \u201cImagine a widespread global conflict in which all satellites and undersea cables are sabotaged,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe Internet\u2019s distributed nature is designed so that connected computers will remain so, but no longer would they remain connected to computers outside of their region.\u201d He argues that you\u2019d end up with a fragmented network where bitcoin transactions get confirmed in one region while others are confirmed elsewhere, leading to irreconcilable chaos in the digital currency\u2019s core \u201cblockchain\u201d ledger once the global network is restored. For this reason, Mr. Kiser is calling on the Bitcoin Foundation and others to build and maintain a global network of solar-powered mobile blockchain servers that are connected to high-frequency shortwave modems. They\u2019d have to be stored in undisclosed locations and be designed to automatically transmit all the blockchain data to the various networks as soon as the Internet fails, he says. Mr. Kiser is asking for comments from technical experts about his idea. We have no idea if it\u2019s viable or even relevant. We\u2019d also be interested to hear what experts think about it.

The firm\u2019s economists Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua\xa0argue Bitcoin has promise as a payments technology, but calling it a \u201ccurrency\u201d is a bridge too far: We would argue that bitcoin, and other digital currencies, currently\xa0lie somewhere on the boundaries between currency, commodity\xa0and financial asset. Our best definition would be that it is currently\xa0a speculative financial asset that can be used as a medium of\xa0exchange. But the difficulties it faces as a store of value are likely\xa0to present a major roadblock to the breadth of bitcoin\u2019s adoption as\xa0a medium of exchange. If a ledger-based technology is to succeed,\xa0the cyber-currency would very likely have to have some type of\xa0fixed exchange rate in order to overcome this obstacle. On net,\xa0more than taking off as a widely-used alternative currency, it is\xa0much more plausible that bitcoin eventually has a significant impact\xa0in terms of its innovation on payments technology, by forcing\xa0existing players to adapt to it or coopt it. And here\u2019s how Jeff Currie, head of Goldman\u2019s commodity research, writes in the report about the comparison to gold. Recent bitcoin\xa0price volatility owes largely to unstable demand. This volatility\xa0undermines the reasons to hold bitcoin. With millenniums of\xa0history behind it as a hedge against debasement, the key to gold\u2019s\xa0success is the stability and predictability of its demand.\xa0On net, we find that bitcoin is easier to store and transport and is\xa0potentially more difficult to counterfeit, but it is not nearly as\xa0\u201cstable\u201d as gold and competitors still pose a greater risk.

(Paul Vigna) - While the hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto overwhelmed our and our competitors\u2019 coverage of all matters bitcoin last week, Barbados hosted a gathering of people more like the elusive founder of the digital currency than probably anyone. This was one excited get-together \u2013 but not because of a story about a Japanese-American train enthusiast who shares the bitcoin creator\u2019s name. It was the 18th\xa0annual conference of the International Financial Cryptography Association, whose ranks are comprised of a breed of computer scientist to which the person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto almost certainly belonged. Throughout two decade of conferences, these people have been chattering about their various ideas for a cryptocurrency. But this year\u2019s, which was partly sponsored by the Bitcoin Foundation, was the first to occur while one of those ideas is gaining traction in society. It was \u201ca watershed event,\u201d said Emir Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell University. \u201cWe have this community of academics who have been thinking about these problems since the 1980s and suddenly here\u2019s this actual currency that people are using. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d (Michael Casey) - Bitcoin, when you stop to think about it, is as much a cultural phenomenon as technological.\xa0If you spend any time talking to bitcoiners, you cannot help but notice the passion and fervor they have for it. People don\u2019t get worked up like that about email, or the Sacagawea coin\xa0(we were among that poor coin\u2019s only fans, for the record). Meanwhile, people write songs about bitcoin. We brought you \u201cOde to Satoshi\u201d a few weeks ago, and we were slipped another single this week: \u201c10,000 bitcoins,\u201d by LA singer Laura Saggers. She wrote the song in December, and was planning to include an album she plans to release this summer. In the meantime, it\u2019s available on her website (and yes, you can pay in bitcoin). She\u2019s not a miner, but she is a bitcoin enthusiast and owns bitcoins and litecoins as well.  If you\u2019re wondering about the generous product placement that ScryptRigs gets in the video (we were), Ms. Saggers said she knows the people who started the company, and decided to give them the free plug. Okay, these songs aren\u2019t exactly \u201cThe Times They Are A Changin\u2019,\u201d but like we said before, music is one way that ideas get passed through the culture, so it\u2019s significant (at least it seems that way to us) that people are passionate enough to write songs about it. \xa0And who knows when a big star will actually mention bitcoin in a song? Our money (no pun intended) would be on Janelle Monae. Something tells us the Electric Lady would go for digital currency.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $628.40, down 1.5% (via CoinDesk) - Should bitcoin take an upper- or lowercase \u201cB\u201d?\xa0If you\u2019re in the words business, it\u2019s not an idle question, and the answer to the question actually helps address that other question, what exactly is bitcoin? You all remember the rule, right? Proper nouns take an uppercase letter, common nouns take a lowercase letter. So, for \u201cGravity,\u201d the movie, you\u2019d use an uppercase \u201cG\u2019,\u201d but for gravity, the scientific concept, you\u2019d use a lowercase \u201cg.\u201d Therefore, how do you characterize bitcoin? Is it a specific thing, such that it would take an uppercase B, or a general, common thing, in which case it gets the lowercase g? Goldman Sachs (capital G, capital S), weighed in on the topic in its report this week. \u201cBitcoin with a capital \u2018B\u2019 is a peer-to-peer network that allows for the proof and transfer of ownership without the need for a trusted third party. The unit of that network is bitcoin with a little \u2018b.\u2019 \u201d That uppercase/lowercase guidance, for the record, was Wall Street Journal style \u2014 until last month. \u201cWe now spell\xa0bitcoin\xa0lowercase, all the time, for the electronic cash system, its network or the virtual currency itself. The plural is\xa0bitcoins,\u201d\xa0our style magistrates wrote\xa0on Feb. 28. In that sense, bitcoin is more like other currencies, which all get lowercased: the dollar, the euro, the yen, the yuan. It helps us. We\u2019d been adhering to the old style for BitBeat, but it was cumbersome. You\u2019re writing about the two so often, and so often in the same space, that it gets to looking very clumsy. We were thankful for the lowercase ruling. It also helps define bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a single, specific Thing. It\u2019s not a Mac, or a Camaro, or \u201cThe Elements of Style.\u201d It\u2019s more diffuse than that. Bitcoin is a multi-faceted, dispersed, decentralized thing.\xa0It is everywhere, under no single entity\u2019s control, like computers and cars and books. Somehow we think that should make the acolytes happy.

To us it seemed like a deft way to appeal to both sides of Washington\u2019s divided politics. In that sense, Mr. Harper\u2019s opening salvo reflects a new phase in the digital currency\u2019s tumultuous journey from fringe to mainstream as the bitcoin industry strives to convince lawmakers and regulators to look beyond the recent spate of alarming headlines and focus instead on the social benefits of a groundbreaking technology. (Michael Casey) - We\u2019ve noticed that the law profession is taking a bigger interest in bitcoin.\xa0Increasingly, we see lawyers talking about bitcoin, and we hear from a lot of lawyers who want to talk about bitcoin. Broadly, it seems like there are two reasons: one, the whole idea just fires their imagination, the prospect of helping to shape an entirely new thing (lowercase t). On the other hand, the industry has been struggling since the Panic of 2008; they\u2019re eager for new business. What sparked us on this tangent was this post from the Credit Slips blog\xa0(sent along by our colleague Emily Glazer). It deals with a little-known corner of commercial law called Article 9, and it questions whether bitcoin, if it is not a currency (and under current law, it isn\u2019t), can be called collateral against business loans, giving creditors a claim on any bitcoin that pass through a business. We don\u2019t have the answer to that question\u2013nobody does yet\u2013but it shows how the legal industry is starting to tackle all the questions that are going to be raised by digital currencies.

Mr. Harper described himself in a blog post on the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s web site as a libertarian. No surprise there \u2013 he was the director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, a mainstay of libertarian thought among Washington think tanks. But his arguments in favor of bitcoin revealed what seemed to be a bipartisan bent to his lobbying efforts, one that embraces both the free-market traditions of the Republican base and \xa0Democratic priorities on social inclusion. \u201cMy personal philosophy is libertarian. That means a lot of things, and the opportunity for worldwide advancement of liberty is definitely one of things that got me engaged with Bitcoin. But what really excites me\u2014what tugs at my heartstrings\u2014is Bitcoin\u2019s potential to improve global financial inclusion. There are billions of people who, through no fault of their own, can\u2019t access formal financial services, so they have a harder time earning, a harder time saving, a harder time feeding their families, and a harder time educating their children. Why on earth, in this day and age, should anyone be \u201cexcluded\u201d from participating in economic activity that improves their lives?\u201d And while Mr. Harper raised the problem of inflation \u2013 a traditional bugaboo of bitcoiners and other opponents of government-issued fiat currencies \u2013 it was its impact on the poor, rather than its harm to wealthy Americans\u2019 savings that got his attention: \u201cI also find galling the effect of inflation on the poor. Smarties like you and I can invest our way out of inflation\u2019s gravitational pull, but even in rich countries, inflation acts as a constant drain on what wealth the poor and under-educated can pull together.\u201d Mr. Harper even gave a nod to those who argue that governments should manage the money supply, albeit while presenting them with a challenge: \u201cI understand the argument that money supplies should be managed, and that they can be managed well. All I need is for people holding that position to accept an empirical test: Let Bitcoin compete.\u201d All up, the post had the hallmarks of the pragmatism of an old Washington hand. At a time when bitcoin\u2019s reputation has been tarnished by bad news \u2013 from the arrest of alleged money launderers to the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange \u2013 leaders of the emerging bitcoin business community are increasingly talking about the need for sensible regulation to bolster confidence among the general public. It\u2019s something of a departure from \u2013 though not a complete repudiation of \u2014 the vigorously laissez-faire arguments pushed by many of the hardline libertarians who were early adopters of the digital currency. As for making bitcoin stronger, he\u2019s also taking a realistic approach that seems to eschew the more fanatical defense of those members of the bitcoin community who\u2019ve refuse to countenance suggestions it might have flaws. He said he is working on a \u201cstudy of the risks that Bitcoin faces and their severity, how to address them and, when possible, how to measure success or failure.\u201d This study will be presented at the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s annual conference in Amsterdam in May, he said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. \nBitcoin Latest Price: $640.53, up 1.4% (via CoinDesk) - Maybe there\u2019s something to dogecoin after all. Dogecoin, the alt-coin launched in December and based on an Internet meme built on top of an Internet meme, has a noisy, loyal, and active fan base. They\u2019re fun-loving, in a good way, and they\u2019re working very diligently to build dogecoin into not only a digital currency, but, to put it in comic book terms, a force for good in this world. In only a few months of existence, it has become the sixth-biggest alt-coin by market cap. It was hard to take them seriously at first, with the coin launching around the time of the whole Kanyecoin joke, but they\u2019re being taken seriously now. GoCoin, a payments platform for digital currencies, said it will now support dogecoin payments, in addition to bitcoin and litecoin. When it comes to currencies, \u201ccommunity is everything,\u201d said Brock Pierce, GoCoin\u2019s co-founder and chairman. \u201cAnd Dogecoin\u2019s community is substantially larger than anything other than bitcoin. We adopt currencies based on demand. And when demand is there and the community is asking for it and merchants are asking for\u2026we\u2019ll make this a priority and implement it.\u201d Mr. Pierce said GoCoin\u2019s analysis of the dogecoin community revealed a demographic very different from bitcoin\u2019s, including many more women and less-tech-oriented users. He believes this in part stems from dogecoin\u2019s logo, containing the image of a shiba inu dog, which he said \u201cjust made it friendly.\u201d In a nod to that beloved dogecoin mascot, GoCoin included its face in its own logo on Thursday\u2019s press release. Another factor behind dogecoin\u2019s appeal, Mr. Pierce said, was its emphasis on philanthropy rather than get-rich-quick schemes. An example of that:\xa0dogecoiners are now seeking to raise money for drought relief in Kenya. These guys really do seem to be about having fun and doing good. Much good, dogecoin. News is big real. So hip. (Paul Vigna, Michael Casey) -Singapore is regulating bitcoin. But in the post-Gox era, that\u2019s seen as a quite a good thing \xa0\u2013 at least in the eyes of a bitcoin business community eager to convince a skeptical general public about the appeal of this digital currency. The libertarian trailblazers who \xa0first drove bitcoin\u2019s growth are unlikely to \xa0feel at ease with new laws of any kind, but the Singapore-based businesses we spoke to are all upbeat. The city-state\u2019s move to enforce anti-money laundering rules reflects its desire to embrace and normalize the technology, they say, much as it has done with other innovations. (Michael Casey) In the News: - The flap over the Newsweek story has died down for the moment.\xa0The magazine says Dorian is Satoshi, Dorian says he\u2019s not Satoshi. Satoshi says Dorian is not Satoshi, unless Dorian is secretly Satoshi saying publicly that he is not Satoshi to throw everybody off the trail. It can all get confusing. The editors over at Priceonomics went back to the start, to the original Newsweek article, and edited it as if it had been submitted to them. \u201cAs we read the article at Priceonomics, we cringed a bit,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAt Priceonomics, a lowly blog, we never would have published the\xa0Newsweek\xa0article in that form. If one of our writers wrote what Newsweek did, an editor would have hacked it to bits.\u201d The team at Newsweek said last week that reporting for the controversial piece \u201cwas conducted under the same high editorial and ethical standards that have guided\xa0Newsweek\xa0for more than 80 years.\u201d You decide. (Paul Vigna) - Team Coco doesn\u2019t get bitcoin, but it gets that it\u2019s worth putting on the air. Earlier this week, Conan O\u2019Brien did a bit (no pun intended, that\u2019s what they call it in the business) on bitcoin, in which the \u201cchief operating officer of Bitcoin\u201d attempted to answer the question, what is bitcoin? Now, of course, the guy, after saying it\u2019s \u201cquite simple,\u201d gave a lot of techno-babble answers, quoted \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d and played a nonsense video, increasingly infuriating O\u2019Brien because he couldn\u2019t simply answer the question (they should\u2019ve been reading BitBeat, but that\u2019s beside the point). It\u2019s pretty much classic farce. The reason it deserves mention here, beyond the fact that we\u2019re partial to O\u2019Brien and thought it was funny, is that it\u2019s one more example of how bitcoin is penetrating into mainstream culture. O\u2019Brien\u2019s show straddles a line between edgy and mainstream, it\u2019s more Laugh-In than Lawrence Welk. But it is a national television show. Bitcoin is as much a cultural movement as a technological one. This is another example of the former.

So, now that the city-state has announced it will regulate digital currencies, what\u2019s the bitcoin business community\u2019s response? Mostly positive, it seems. That may be a sign that, in the wake of the spectacular collapse of Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, those in the industry trying to bring bitcoin into the mainstream are eager for regulations that establish clear ground rules\xa0 for virtual currencies. And Singapore\u2019s announcement fits that bill. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it will require dealers that buy, sell or facilitate the exchange of virtual currencies for fiat currencies\u2013such as the U.S. or Singapore dollars\u2013\u201dto verify the identities of their customers and report suspicious transactions.\u201d They aren\u2019t the first to make such moves. The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, has said it will require exchanges and brokers to pursue money transmitter licenses, which require similar customer surveillance commitments. The same \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d and anti-money laundering rules are expected to be integrated into a special \u201cbit-license\u201d that New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services is creating. Whereas early adopters of bitcoin, many of whom hail from libertarian backgrounds, were initially drawn to the digital currency\u2019s Wild West-like trading experience, a string of negative developments \u2013 from the arrests of big users of bitcoin associated with the Silk Road illicit drug-trading site to the Mt. Gox collapse \u2013 have changed the calculus. Many bitcoin business leaders are now keen to resolve the legal uncertainty, as they want to give skeptical businesses and consumers more confidence that they can transact and invest in this newfangled creation. Clearly, though, these business interests would much prefer accommodating approaches such as Singapore\u2019s over draconian responses, like that of Russia, where authorities responded to bitcoin\u2019s rise by announcing that currencies other than the ruble were illegal. Singapore\u2019s move \u201cis a very positive development,\u201d said Brock Pierce, co-founder and chairman of GoCoin, a global digital currency payments processor headquartered in Singapore. He said that for GoCoin and other Singapore-based bitcoin businesses that have \u201calready implemented best practices around these activities,\u201d the new rules around customer compliance will have no impact. Singapore has a reputation for excessive regulation in some areas \u2013 think of its ban on chewing gum \u2013 but in areas of technological development where it sees value for the city-state\u2019s future growth, it has embraced a much softer touch. It\u2019s a posture that harks back to the free-trade principles behind its decades-long role as a major shipping port and trade hub. Bitcoiners believe Singapore is taking a similar view of the groundbreaking technology behind digital currencies. \u201cSingapore is a fascinating country in terms of what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish in the last 50 years and it\u2019s because of decisions like this, which show they understand innovation and choose to embrace it with sensible regulation,\u201d said GoCoin\u2019s Mr. Pierce in an interview. Atlas ATS CEO Shawn Solves, whose company this week launched a globally integrated high-tech digital-currency exchange for institutional investors in conjunction with Wall Street-focused telecommunications provider Perseus Telecom, said he was heartened by the news of Singapore\u2019s regulatory step. Atlas, which is actively promoting its strict compliance with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules, had set up a banking relationship in Singapore and planned to provide co-located trading operations there as well as in Hong Kong and New York.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$636.05, up 1.13% (via\xa0CoinDesk) - It\u2019s been just a few weeks since CoinDesk dumped Mt. Gox from its bitcoin price index, but it already has found a new exchange to take its place. The London-based bitcoin news provider plans to announce on Thursday that it is adding Bitfinex to its price index, which currently includes Bitstamp of Slovenia and BTC-e of Bulgaria. Bitfinex is incorporated in Hong Kong. \u201cOver the past several weeks, and particularly since the decline of Mt. Gox, we have observed that Bitfinex has been able to sustain a dramatic increase in its share of the total volume of U.S. dollar-denominated bitcoins traded,\u201d according to a CoinDesk statement. (Robin Sidel) - The next generation of exchanges will look nothing like Mt. Gox. \xa0We report that Perseus Telecom, which installs super-fast high bandwidth lines linking traditional securities exchanges to the trade execution platforms of financial institutions, is teaming up with bitcoin exchange Atlas ATS to launch a global trading platform for the digital currency. The target market is not your guy in pajamas trading from his living room; it\u2019s high-volume, sophisticated investment firms. In terms of regulatory compliance, security features and the closed-nature of the dedicated network on which it runs, this exchange will look much more like those that Wall Street uses to trade stocks and bonds than the ones we associate with bitcoin trading now. And in case you thought the Mt. Gox debacle and other scandals were scaring traders away from bitcoin, it\u2019s worth nothing that Perseus and Atlas have been encouraged to enter this business by clients in the high-frequency trading sector. That would suggest that volumes are going to rise by a lot more yet. No guarantee it will solve the volatility problem, though. (Michael Casey) - Goldman Sachs has weighed in on bitcoin.\xa0Bitcoiners can be proud that the buzz they\u2019ve generated has not only gotten a reaction from a Wall Street icon that many of them love to hate but that it has come in the form of a full 25-page report. Whether they can be pleased with its conclusions is another matter. That depends on whether they\u2019re drawn to the digital currency out of hope it will replace the dollar and other fiat currencies as the primary means of exchange and store of value or whether they\u2019re excited by the underlying technology\u2019s promise as a payments system. For the first group, Goldman is pretty adamant that their hopes are exaggerated. The title of an article in the report penned by Goldman Sachs Markets analysts Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua is blunt: \u201cIs bitcoin a currency? No.\u201d Bitcoin is simply too volatile to function as a store of value, they say, citing one of the properties used to define a successful currency. But as a payments system, Messrs. Wilson and Ursua \u2013 as well as other contributors to the report \u2013 are more admiring. In theory, the cost savings in peer-to-peer bitcoin payment transfers over traditional payments could run to more than $100 billion per year, writes Goldman Sachs IT Services equity analyst Roman Leal. But he and others also note that new costs associated with security and bitcoin intermediaries could reduce that amount significantly. In sum, Uncle Sam should not be worried, but this bitcoin thing should give Mastercard and Western Union something to think about. \xa0(Michael Casey) - What happens to bitcoin if the Internet goes down?\xa0A\xa0post from Garth Kiser over at the blog Pursuing Nothing caught our eye. Mr. Kiser is clearly an enthusiast for bitcoin, which he calls a \u201cmonumental leap towards a peer-governed future,\u201d but he worries about how the distributed network that runs its core infrastructure would handle a major disruption to the Internet. \u201cImagine a widespread global conflict in which all satellites and undersea cables are sabotaged,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe Internet\u2019s distributed nature is designed so that connected computers will remain so, but no longer would they remain connected to computers outside of their region.\u201d He argues that you\u2019d end up with a fragmented network where bitcoin transactions get confirmed in one region while others are confirmed elsewhere, leading to irreconcilable chaos in the digital currency\u2019s core \u201cblockchain\u201d ledger once the global network is restored. For this reason, Mr. Kiser is calling on the Bitcoin Foundation and others to build and maintain a global network of solar-powered mobile blockchain servers that are connected to high-frequency shortwave modems. They\u2019d have to be stored in undisclosed locations and be designed to automatically transmit all the blockchain data to the various networks as soon as the Internet fails, he says. Mr. Kiser is asking for comments from technical experts about his idea. We have no idea if it\u2019s viable or even relevant. We\u2019d also be interested to hear what experts think about it.

The firm\u2019s economists Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua\xa0argue Bitcoin has promise as a payments technology, but calling it a \u201ccurrency\u201d is a bridge too far: We would argue that bitcoin, and other digital currencies, currently\xa0lie somewhere on the boundaries between currency, commodity\xa0and financial asset. Our best definition would be that it is currently\xa0a speculative financial asset that can be used as a medium of\xa0exchange.

Our money (no pun intended) would be on Janelle Monae. Something tells us the Electric Lady would go for digital currency. (Paul Vigna) - Cyprus too?\xa0A PR Newswire press release announced today the creation in Cyprus of \u201caphroditecoin,\u201d an idea that seemed based on the auroracoin, which is being distributed to every one of Iceland\u2019s 330,000 citizens and which has soared in price since its launch two weeks ago.\xa0 Some 885,000 Cypriots will similarly get an \u201cairdrop\u201d of \u201caphroditecoins,\u201d the press release said. It also claimed that the reaction in the nation \u2013 which, like Iceland, has gone through its own financial crisis \u2014 was \u201cconcordantly positive.\u201d But when we looked into it, odd things emerged. We dialed the number for someone listed as \u201cCosta Themistocleus\u201d and were told it was a wrong number. We then went to the Aphroditecoin.org web site and discovered that it was based off a carbon copy of the auroracoin.org site, with large sections of its front-page manifesto by \u201cCosta Themistocleus\u201d lifted directly from that of Baldur Friggjar Odinsson, the pseudonymous creator of auroracoin. So, we found the only email on the site, one used as a pitch for developers to help out \u2013 dev@aphroditecoin.org \u2013 and it bounced. Then we noticed something else: unlike auroracoin.org, which has a button with which to toggle between English and Icelandic, there was no option to read about this project in Greek or Turkish. This all seemed like a pretty good reason not to hit the software download buttons on the home page. Until we hear back from \u201cMr. Themistocleus,\u201d we don\u2019t think anyone else should do so, either.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $628.40, down 1.5% (via CoinDesk) - Should bitcoin take an upper- or lowercase \u201cB\u201d?\xa0If you\u2019re in the words business, it\u2019s not an idle question, and the answer to the question actually helps address that other question, what exactly is bitcoin? You all remember the rule, right? Proper nouns take an uppercase letter, common nouns take a lowercase letter. So, for \u201cGravity,\u201d the movie, you\u2019d use an uppercase \u201cG\u2019,\u201d but for gravity, the scientific concept, you\u2019d use a lowercase \u201cg.\u201d Therefore, how do you characterize bitcoin? Is it a specific thing, such that it would take an uppercase B, or a general, common thing, in which case it gets the lowercase g? Goldman Sachs (capital G, capital S), weighed in on the topic in its report this week. \u201cBitcoin with a capital \u2018B\u2019 is a peer-to-peer network that allows for the proof and transfer of ownership without the need for a trusted third party. The unit of that network is bitcoin with a little \u2018b.\u2019 \u201d That uppercase/lowercase guidance, for the record, was Wall Street Journal style \u2014 until last month. \u201cWe now spell\xa0bitcoin\xa0lowercase, all the time, for the electronic cash system, its network or the virtual currency itself. The plural is\xa0bitcoins,\u201d\xa0our style magistrates wrote\xa0on Feb. 28. In that sense, bitcoin is more like other currencies, which all get lowercased: the dollar, the euro, the yen, the yuan. It helps us. We\u2019d been adhering to the old style for BitBeat, but it was cumbersome. You\u2019re writing about the two so often, and so often in the same space, that it gets to looking very clumsy. We were thankful for the lowercase ruling. It also helps define bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a single, specific Thing. It\u2019s not a Mac, or a Camaro, or \u201cThe Elements of Style.\u201d It\u2019s more diffuse than that. Bitcoin is a multi-faceted, dispersed, decentralized thing.\xa0It is everywhere, under no single entity\u2019s control, like computers and cars and books. Somehow we think that should make the acolytes happy. (Paul Vigna) - Bill Harper, the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s new Washington liaison, penned a revealing blog post for the Foundation\u2019s web site.\xa0The Cato Institute fellow described himself as \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 a libertarian, but he went to great lengths to emphasize that the real promise of bitcoin lies in empowering the poor. To us it seemed like a deft way to appeal to both sides of Washington\u2019s divided politics. In that sense, Mr. Harper\u2019s opening salvo reflects a new phase in the digital currency\u2019s tumultuous journey from fringe to mainstream as the bitcoin industry strives to convince lawmakers and regulators to look beyond the recent spate of alarming headlines and focus instead on the social benefits of a groundbreaking technology. (Michael Casey) - We\u2019ve noticed that the law profession is taking a bigger interest in bitcoin.\xa0Increasingly, we see lawyers talking about bitcoin, and we hear from a lot of lawyers who want to talk about bitcoin. Broadly, it seems like there are two reasons: one, the whole idea just fires their imagination, the prospect of helping to shape an entirely new thing (lowercase t). On the other hand, the industry has been struggling since the Panic of 2008; they\u2019re eager for new business. What sparked us on this tangent was this post from the Credit Slips blog\xa0(sent along by our colleague Emily Glazer). It deals with a little-known corner of commercial law called Article 9, and it questions whether bitcoin, if it is not a currency (and under current law, it isn\u2019t), can be called collateral against business loans, giving creditors a claim on any bitcoin that pass through a business. We don\u2019t have the answer to that question\u2013nobody does yet\u2013but it shows how the legal industry is starting to tackle all the questions that are going to be raised by digital currencies.

Mr. Harper described himself in a blog post on the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s web site as a libertarian. No surprise there \u2013 he was the director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, a mainstay of libertarian thought among Washington think tanks. But his arguments in favor of bitcoin revealed what seemed to be a bipartisan bent to his lobbying efforts, one that embraces both the free-market traditions of the Republican base and \xa0Democratic priorities on social inclusion. \u201cMy personal philosophy is libertarian. That means a lot of things, and the opportunity for worldwide advancement of liberty is definitely one of things that got me engaged with Bitcoin. But what really excites me\u2014what tugs at my heartstrings\u2014is Bitcoin\u2019s potential to improve global financial inclusion. There are billions of people who, through no fault of their own, can\u2019t access formal financial services, so they have a harder time earning, a harder time saving, a harder time feeding their families, and a harder time educating their children. Why on earth, in this day and age, should anyone be \u201cexcluded\u201d from participating in economic activity that improves their lives?\u201d And while Mr. Harper raised the problem of inflation \u2013 a traditional bugaboo of bitcoiners and other opponents of government-issued fiat currencies \u2013 it was its impact on the poor, rather than its harm to wealthy Americans\u2019 savings that got his attention: \u201cI also find galling the effect of inflation on the poor. Smarties like you and I can invest our way out of inflation\u2019s gravitational pull, but even in rich countries, inflation acts as a constant drain on what wealth the poor and under-educated can pull together.\u201d Mr. Harper even gave a nod to those who argue that governments should manage the money supply, albeit while presenting them with a challenge: \u201cI understand the argument that money supplies should be managed, and that they can be managed well. All I need is for people holding that position to accept an empirical test: Let Bitcoin compete.\u201d All up, the post had the hallmarks of the pragmatism of an old Washington hand. At a time when bitcoin\u2019s reputation has been tarnished by bad news \u2013 from the arrest of alleged money launderers to the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange \u2013 leaders of the emerging bitcoin business community are increasingly talking about the need for sensible regulation to bolster confidence among the general public. It\u2019s something of a departure from \u2013 though not a complete repudiation of \u2014 the vigorously laissez-faire arguments pushed by many of the hardline libertarians who were early adopters of the digital currency. As for making bitcoin stronger, he\u2019s also taking a realistic approach that seems to eschew the more fanatical defense of those members of the bitcoin community who\u2019ve refuse to countenance suggestions it might have flaws. He said he is working on a \u201cstudy of the risks that Bitcoin faces and their severity, how to address them and, when possible, how to measure success or failure.\u201d This study will be presented at the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s annual conference in Amsterdam in May, he said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Dogecoin, the alt-coin launched in December and based on an Internet meme built on top of an Internet meme, has a noisy, loyal, and active fan base. They\u2019re fun-loving, in a good way, and they\u2019re working very diligently to build dogecoin into not only a digital currency, but, to put it in comic book terms, a force for good in this world. In only a few months of existence, it has become the sixth-biggest alt-coin by market cap. It was hard to take them seriously at first, with the coin launching around the time of the whole Kanyecoin joke, but they\u2019re being taken seriously now. GoCoin, a payments platform for digital currencies, said it will now support dogecoin payments, in addition to bitcoin and litecoin. When it comes to currencies, \u201ccommunity is everything,\u201d said Brock Pierce, GoCoin\u2019s co-founder and chairman. \u201cAnd Dogecoin\u2019s community is substantially larger than anything other than bitcoin. We adopt currencies based on demand. And when demand is there and the community is asking for it and merchants are asking for\u2026we\u2019ll make this a priority and implement it.\u201d Mr. Pierce said GoCoin\u2019s analysis of the dogecoin community revealed a demographic very different from bitcoin\u2019s, including many more women and less-tech-oriented users. He believes this in part stems from dogecoin\u2019s logo, containing the image of a shiba inu dog, which he said \u201cjust made it friendly.\u201d In a nod to that beloved dogecoin mascot, GoCoin included its face in its own logo on Thursday\u2019s press release. Another factor behind dogecoin\u2019s appeal, Mr. Pierce said, was its emphasis on philanthropy rather than get-rich-quick schemes. An example of that:\xa0dogecoiners are now seeking to raise money for drought relief in Kenya. These guys really do seem to be about having fun and doing good. Much good, dogecoin. News is big real. So hip. (Paul Vigna, Michael Casey) -Singapore is regulating bitcoin. But in the post-Gox era, that\u2019s seen as a quite a good thing \xa0\u2013 at least in the eyes of a bitcoin business community eager to convince a skeptical general public about the appeal of this digital currency. The libertarian trailblazers who \xa0first drove bitcoin\u2019s growth are unlikely to \xa0feel at ease with new laws of any kind, but the Singapore-based businesses we spoke to are all upbeat. The city-state\u2019s move to enforce anti-money laundering rules reflects its desire to embrace and normalize the technology, they say, much as it has done with other innovations. (Michael Casey) In the News: - The flap over the Newsweek story has died down for the moment.\xa0The magazine says Dorian is Satoshi, Dorian says he\u2019s not Satoshi. Satoshi says Dorian is not Satoshi, unless Dorian is secretly Satoshi saying publicly that he is not Satoshi to throw everybody off the trail. It can all get confusing. The editors over at Priceonomics went back to the start, to the original Newsweek article, and edited it as if it had been submitted to them. \u201cAs we read the article at Priceonomics, we cringed a bit,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAt Priceonomics, a lowly blog, we never would have published the\xa0Newsweek\xa0article in that form.

(Paul Vigna) - Team Coco doesn\u2019t get bitcoin, but it gets that it\u2019s worth putting on the air. Earlier this week, Conan O\u2019Brien did a bit (no pun intended, that\u2019s what they call it in the business) on bitcoin, in which the \u201cchief operating officer of Bitcoin\u201d attempted to answer the question, what is bitcoin? Now, of course, the guy, after saying it\u2019s \u201cquite simple,\u201d gave a lot of techno-babble answers, quoted \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d and played a nonsense video, increasingly infuriating O\u2019Brien because he couldn\u2019t simply answer the question (they should\u2019ve been reading BitBeat, but that\u2019s beside the point). It\u2019s pretty much classic farce. The reason it deserves mention here, beyond the fact that we\u2019re partial to O\u2019Brien and thought it was funny, is that it\u2019s one more example of how bitcoin is penetrating into mainstream culture. O\u2019Brien\u2019s show straddles a line between edgy and mainstream, it\u2019s more Laugh-In than Lawrence Welk. But it is a national television show. Bitcoin is as much a cultural movement as a technological one. This is another example of the former.

So, now that the city-state has announced it will regulate digital currencies, what\u2019s the bitcoin business community\u2019s response? Mostly positive, it seems. That may be a sign that, in the wake of the spectacular collapse of Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, those in the industry trying to bring bitcoin into the mainstream are eager for regulations that establish clear ground rules\xa0 for virtual currencies. And Singapore\u2019s announcement fits that bill. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it will require dealers that buy, sell or facilitate the exchange of virtual currencies for fiat currencies\u2013such as the U.S. or Singapore dollars\u2013\u201dto verify the identities of their customers and report suspicious transactions.\u201d They aren\u2019t the first to make such moves. The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, has said it will require exchanges and brokers to pursue money transmitter licenses, which require similar customer surveillance commitments. The same \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d and anti-money laundering rules are expected to be integrated into a special \u201cbit-license\u201d that New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services is creating. Whereas early adopters of bitcoin, many of whom hail from libertarian backgrounds, were initially drawn to the digital currency\u2019s Wild West-like trading experience, a string of negative developments \u2013 from the arrests of big users of bitcoin associated with the Silk Road illicit drug-trading site to the Mt. Gox collapse \u2013 have changed the calculus. Many bitcoin business leaders are now keen to resolve the legal uncertainty, as they want to give skeptical businesses and consumers more confidence that they can transact and invest in this newfangled creation. Clearly, though, these business interests would much prefer accommodating approaches such as Singapore\u2019s over draconian responses, like that of Russia, where authorities responded to bitcoin\u2019s rise by announcing that currencies other than the ruble were illegal. Singapore\u2019s move \u201cis a very positive development,\u201d said Brock Pierce, co-founder and chairman of GoCoin, a global digital currency payments processor headquartered in Singapore. He said that for GoCoin and other Singapore-based bitcoin businesses that have \u201calready implemented best practices around these activities,\u201d the new rules around customer compliance will have no impact. Singapore has a reputation for excessive regulation in some areas \u2013 think of its ban on chewing gum \u2013 but in areas of technological development where it sees value for the city-state\u2019s future growth, it has embraced a much softer touch. It\u2019s a posture that harks back to the free-trade principles behind its decades-long role as a major shipping port and trade hub. Bitcoiners believe Singapore is taking a similar view of the groundbreaking technology behind digital currencies. \u201cSingapore is a fascinating country in terms of what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish in the last 50 years and it\u2019s because of decisions like this, which show they understand innovation and choose to embrace it with sensible regulation,\u201d said GoCoin\u2019s Mr. Pierce in an interview. Atlas ATS CEO Shawn Solves, whose company this week launched a globally integrated high-tech digital-currency exchange for institutional investors in conjunction with Wall Street-focused telecommunications provider Perseus Telecom, said he was heartened by the news of Singapore\u2019s regulatory step. Atlas, which is actively promoting its strict compliance with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules, had set up a banking relationship in Singapore and planned to provide co-located trading operations there as well as in Hong Kong and New York.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$636.05, up 1.13% (via\xa0CoinDesk) - It\u2019s been just a few weeks since CoinDesk dumped Mt. Gox from its bitcoin price index, but it already has found a new exchange to take its place. The London-based bitcoin news provider plans to announce on Thursday that it is adding Bitfinex to its price index, which currently includes Bitstamp of Slovenia and BTC-e of Bulgaria. Bitfinex is incorporated in Hong Kong. \u201cOver the past several weeks, and particularly since the decline of Mt. Gox, we have observed that Bitfinex has been able to sustain a dramatic increase in its share of the total volume of U.S. dollar-denominated bitcoins traded,\u201d according to a CoinDesk statement. (Robin Sidel) - The next generation of exchanges will look nothing like Mt. Gox. \xa0We report that Perseus Telecom, which installs super-fast high bandwidth lines linking traditional securities exchanges to the trade execution platforms of financial institutions, is teaming up with bitcoin exchange Atlas ATS to launch a global trading platform for the digital currency. The target market is not your guy in pajamas trading from his living room; it\u2019s high-volume, sophisticated investment firms. In terms of regulatory compliance, security features and the closed-nature of the dedicated network on which it runs, this exchange will look much more like those that Wall Street uses to trade stocks and bonds than the ones we associate with bitcoin trading now. And in case you thought the Mt. Gox debacle and other scandals were scaring traders away from bitcoin, it\u2019s worth nothing that Perseus and Atlas have been encouraged to enter this business by clients in the high-frequency trading sector. That would suggest that volumes are going to rise by a lot more yet. No guarantee it will solve the volatility problem, though. (Michael Casey) - Goldman Sachs has weighed in on bitcoin.\xa0Bitcoiners can be proud that the buzz they\u2019ve generated has not only gotten a reaction from a Wall Street icon that many of them love to hate but that it has come in the form of a full 25-page report. Whether they can be pleased with its conclusions is another matter. That depends on whether they\u2019re drawn to the digital currency out of hope it will replace the dollar and other fiat currencies as the primary means of exchange and store of value or whether they\u2019re excited by the underlying technology\u2019s promise as a payments system. For the first group, Goldman is pretty adamant that their hopes are exaggerated. The title of an article in the report penned by Goldman Sachs Markets analysts Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua is blunt: \u201cIs bitcoin a currency? No.\u201d Bitcoin is simply too volatile to function as a store of value, they say, citing one of the properties used to define a successful currency. But as a payments system, Messrs. Wilson and Ursua \u2013 as well as other contributors to the report \u2013 are more admiring. In theory, the cost savings in peer-to-peer bitcoin payment transfers over traditional payments could run to more than $100 billion per year, writes Goldman Sachs IT Services equity analyst Roman Leal.

In sum, Uncle Sam should not be worried, but this bitcoin thing should give Mastercard and Western Union something to think about. \xa0(Michael Casey) - What happens to bitcoin if the Internet goes down?\xa0A\xa0post from Garth Kiser over at the blog Pursuing Nothing caught our eye. Mr. Kiser is clearly an enthusiast for bitcoin, which he calls a \u201cmonumental leap towards a peer-governed future,\u201d but he worries about how the distributed network that runs its core infrastructure would handle a major disruption to the Internet. \u201cImagine a widespread global conflict in which all satellites and undersea cables are sabotaged,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe Internet\u2019s distributed nature is designed so that connected computers will remain so, but no longer would they remain connected to computers outside of their region.\u201d He argues that you\u2019d end up with a fragmented network where bitcoin transactions get confirmed in one region while others are confirmed elsewhere, leading to irreconcilable chaos in the digital currency\u2019s core \u201cblockchain\u201d ledger once the global network is restored. For this reason, Mr. Kiser is calling on the Bitcoin Foundation and others to build and maintain a global network of solar-powered mobile blockchain servers that are connected to high-frequency shortwave modems. They\u2019d have to be stored in undisclosed locations and be designed to automatically transmit all the blockchain data to the various networks as soon as the Internet fails, he says. Mr. Kiser is asking for comments from technical experts about his idea. We have no idea if it\u2019s viable or even relevant. We\u2019d also be interested to hear what experts think about it.

The firm\u2019s economists Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua\xa0argue Bitcoin has promise as a payments technology, but calling it a \u201ccurrency\u201d is a bridge too far: We would argue that bitcoin, and other digital currencies, currently\xa0lie somewhere on the boundaries between currency, commodity\xa0and financial asset. Our best definition would be that it is currently\xa0a speculative financial asset that can be used as a medium of\xa0exchange. But the difficulties it faces as a store of value are likely\xa0to present a major roadblock to the breadth of bitcoin\u2019s adoption as\xa0a medium of exchange. If a ledger-based technology is to succeed,\xa0the cyber-currency would very likely have to have some type of\xa0fixed exchange rate in order to overcome this obstacle. On net,\xa0more than taking off as a widely-used alternative currency, it is\xa0much more plausible that bitcoin eventually has a significant impact\xa0in terms of its innovation on payments technology, by forcing\xa0existing players to adapt to it or coopt it. And here\u2019s how Jeff Currie, head of Goldman\u2019s commodity research, writes in the report about the comparison to gold. Recent bitcoin\xa0price volatility owes largely to unstable demand. This volatility\xa0undermines the reasons to hold bitcoin. With millenniums of\xa0history behind it as a hedge against debasement, the key to gold\u2019s\xa0success is the stability and predictability of its demand.\xa0On net, we find that bitcoin is easier to store and transport and is\xa0potentially more difficult to counterfeit, but it is not nearly as\xa0\u201cstable\u201d as gold and competitors still pose a greater risk.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $634.61, up 1.4% (via CoinDesk) - You don\u2019t need Albert Einstein\u2019s brain, or\xa0Albert Edwards\u2019s\xa0brain, or even Edward Grimley\u2019s\xa0brain, to realize that bitcoin is a risky investment. Anything that goes from $10 to $600, back to $180, to $1,200, and then back to $600 in a span of 14 months is not exactly what you\u2019d call stable. Regardless, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra as they call it in the business, issued an investor alert on the world\u2019s most popular digital currency (sorry, dogecoin). \u201cFinra is issuing this alert to caution investors that buying and using digital currency such as bitcoin carry risks,\u201d the alert said. \u201cSpeculative trading in bitcoins carries significant risk. There is also the risk of fraud related to companies claiming to offer Bitcoin payment platforms and other Bitcoin-related products and services.\u201d Notice they don\u2019t outright tell you not to invest in bitcoin, just that it carries risks. This is Wall Street after all. (Paul Vigna) - While the hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto overwhelmed our and our competitors\u2019 coverage of all matters bitcoin last week, Barbados hosted a gathering of people more like the elusive founder of the digital currency than probably anyone. This was one excited get-together \u2013 but not because of a story about a Japanese-American train enthusiast who shares the bitcoin creator\u2019s name. It was the 18th\xa0annual conference of the International Financial Cryptography Association, whose ranks are comprised of a breed of computer scientist to which the person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto almost certainly belonged. Throughout two decade of conferences, these people have been chattering about their various ideas for a cryptocurrency. But this year\u2019s, which was partly sponsored by the Bitcoin Foundation, was the first to occur while one of those ideas is gaining traction in society. It was \u201ca watershed event,\u201d said Emir Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell University. \u201cWe have this community of academics who have been thinking about these problems since the 1980s and suddenly here\u2019s this actual currency that people are using. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d (Michael Casey) - Bitcoin, when you stop to think about it, is as much a cultural phenomenon as technological.\xa0If you spend any time talking to bitcoiners, you cannot help but notice the passion and fervor they have for it. People don\u2019t get worked up like that about email, or the Sacagawea coin\xa0(we were among that poor coin\u2019s only fans, for the record). Meanwhile, people write songs about bitcoin. We brought you \u201cOde to Satoshi\u201d a few weeks ago, and we were slipped another single this week: \u201c10,000 bitcoins,\u201d by LA singer Laura Saggers. She wrote the song in December, and was planning to include an album she plans to release this summer. In the meantime, it\u2019s available on her website (and yes, you can pay in bitcoin). She\u2019s not a miner, but she is a bitcoin enthusiast and owns bitcoins and litecoins as well.  If you\u2019re wondering about the generous product placement that ScryptRigs gets in the video (we were), Ms. Saggers said she knows the people who started the company, and decided to give them the free plug. Okay, these songs aren\u2019t exactly \u201cThe Times They Are A Changin\u2019,\u201d but like we said before, music is one way that ideas get passed through the culture, so it\u2019s significant (at least it seems that way to us) that people are passionate enough to write songs about it. \xa0And who knows when a big star will actually mention bitcoin in a song? Our money (no pun intended) would be on Janelle Monae. Something tells us the Electric Lady would go for digital currency. (Paul Vigna) - Cyprus too?\xa0A PR Newswire press release announced today the creation in Cyprus of \u201caphroditecoin,\u201d an idea that seemed based on the auroracoin, which is being distributed to every one of Iceland\u2019s 330,000 citizens and which has soared in price since its launch two weeks ago.\xa0 Some 885,000 Cypriots will similarly get an \u201cairdrop\u201d of \u201caphroditecoins,\u201d the press release said. It also claimed that the reaction in the nation \u2013 which, like Iceland, has gone through its own financial crisis \u2014 was \u201cconcordantly positive.\u201d But when we looked into it, odd things emerged. We dialed the number for someone listed as \u201cCosta Themistocleus\u201d and were told it was a wrong number. We then went to the Aphroditecoin.org web site and discovered that it was based off a carbon copy of the auroracoin.org site, with large sections of its front-page manifesto by \u201cCosta Themistocleus\u201d lifted directly from that of Baldur Friggjar Odinsson, the pseudonymous creator of auroracoin. So, we found the only email on the site, one used as a pitch for developers to help out \u2013 dev@aphroditecoin.org \u2013 and it bounced. Then we noticed something else: unlike auroracoin.org, which has a button with which to toggle between English and Icelandic, there was no option to read about this project in Greek or Turkish. This all seemed like a pretty good reason not to hit the software download buttons on the home page. Until we hear back from \u201cMr. Themistocleus,\u201d we don\u2019t think anyone else should do so, either.

It was the 18th annual conference of the International Financial Cryptography Association, but it was the first one to occur while a real-life cryptocurrency \u2013an idea the delegates had championed for decades \u2013\xa0was actually showing traction in wider society. In contrast with its relatively low profile at the time of last year\u2019s IFCA conference, bitcoin is now used by tens of thousands of merchants and millions of consumers, has a market capitalization of almost $8 billion, and has the entire world watching it \u2013 for better or worse.

The \u201ctopic of the day\u201d at the workshop, he said, was \u201ctransaction malleability.\u201d Remember that one? Seems like eons ago.\xa0 That quirk in the bitcoin core software\u2019s flexible treatment of transaction IDs, which gave rise to a hacking attack that crippled exchanges, was big news less than a month ago. But since then, we\u2019ve had the collapse of Mt. Gox and the hoopla over Newsweek\u2019s claim to have identified the real Nakamoto to distract us. Still, to Mr. Sirer, transaction malleability remains \u201ca real problem, not a trivial one to fix\u201d and that\u2019s \u201cdefinitely going to take some thought.\u201d Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen, the man responsible for coordinating the fixes to those hacking attacks, was also in Barbados, where he led the workshop. Mr. Andresen leads a team of five developers responsible for maintaining the digital currency\u2019s core software. Mr. Andresen says he found the workshop constructive to his team\u2019s efforts to strengthen bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure and reputation. He also said it was a good chance for the overworked Bitcoin Foundation staff to meet face to face for once and address their project\u2019s challenges in a remote, relatively quiet place. But he worried that the enthusiastic audience had overly high expectations for the myriad improvements they would like for bitcoin. \u201cI worry that the hype will outrun the reality of how fast these changes can take place,\u201d he said in an interview Monday. \u201cPeople will expect a super-easy-to-use, super-secure wallet right now so that they can just install some software and store hundreds of thousands of bitcoins on their phone that just won\u2019t be stolen.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$619.22, down 2.2% \xa0(via\xa0CoinDesk) - All the hullabaloo over Newsweek\u2019s Satoshi story has put bitcoin\u2019s \u201ccreation myth\u201d into the spotlight. \u201cCreation myths, of which Genesis is perhaps the most famous example, explain a society\u2019s central values,\u201d Nicholas Colas, an analyst at ConvergEx, wrote today. Apart from the \u201cperhaps\u201d bit (we are talking about the Bible here, after all) we think he\u2019s onto something. \u201cIn business, creation stories reinforce the role of the individual as a societal agent of change and speak to a core audience of customers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are the bedrock for what marketers call \u2018Brand\u2019 and the source waters for Wall Street\u2019s \u2018shareholder value.\u2019 \u201d After Genesis, he runs through a couple other famous creations myths in the business and financial world: Steve Jobs and his garage, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard and their garage, Steve Chen creating YouTube because he couldn\u2019t find a place to post his home movies online. A secretive group of bankers on a remote island creating the Fed. Bitcoin\u2019s creation myth is different from these. Most business creation myths involve a brilliant, possibly misunderstood, person who perseveres through ridiculous odds to bring their creation to the world \u2014 and get rich in the process. That last bit is where the bitcoin creation myth gets very different. \u201cWe are in the middle of a societal reset on the garage-and-a-dream creation myth,\u201d Mr. Colas wrote. The real Satoshi (who may or may not be Dorian Nakamoto) isn\u2019t interested (apparently) in riches or fame. He not only did not incorporate a company to capitalize on his creation, he hasn\u2019t even claimed it as his own. This has created much consternation in the real world, but almost none in the crypto world. \u201cTherein lies the lesson from the last week: there\u2019s a new myth in town, and it\u2019s not about people anymore,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s power to hold the imagination of its users has nothing to do with its creator.\xa0 The price action tells you that. If Newsweek\u2019s man is really THE Satoshi, no one cares that he likes model trains and appears a bit confused. And if he isn\u2019t, no one seems to care either.\u201d - The subredditers sure have a surfeit of targets these days. From journalists harassing their beloved Satoshi, to journalists writing not-glowing things about bitcoin, to journalists\u2026well, let\u2019s just say there are lot of people talking about bitcoin. The latest high-profile pundit to opine in the crypto-patch is Dr. Doom himself, Nouriel Roubini, who called bitcoin a Ponzi scheme. - The happiest man in the bitcoin world this past week has to be Mark Karpeles, because the Newsweek-story furor has completely thrown his bankrupt company off the proverbial front page. But that doesn\u2019t mean his troubles are over. Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the U.S., and hackers on Sunday apparently broke into the company\u2019s servers and his personal account and pilfered what they say is a lot of information the company was holding back. Forbes has the details here. (h/t, Bitcoins Insider) - We were hipped to this last week, but amid all the craziness over the Newsweek story, it slipped under out radar. It\u2019s a humorous video that pokes fun at bitcoin\u2019s true-believer set. We can\u2019t print the name of it in a family blog like ours, and we can\u2019t even embed it because the title of the video would show.

Gox spells doom for the crypto-currency should meet the pack of self-described anarchists that gathered in the basement of Brave New Books in Austin on Sunday. A few dozen people, many seemingly in their late 20s and early 30s and some with young children in tow, came together for a full day of panel speeches and discussions celebrating bitcoin and what its use means for their political beliefs. Some wore T-shirts showing cannon barrels and they talked about politics and the shuttered online marketplace Silk Road. The mother of the site\u2019s alleged architect was in attendance. The headline speaker: Cody Wilson, subject of a page-one Wall Street Journal article who is known for unsettling lawmakers by making a plastic gun with a 3-D printer and founding a startup aimed at covering the tracks of financial transactions made with bitcoin. He described how bitcoin takes human interaction \u201cdeep into the black market.\u201d \u201cThat is its great hope if we are anarchists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe possibility of bitcoin is that it is uninvestigateable, that there will be 1,000 Silk Roads \u2014 and let them bloom.\u201d\xa0On Silk Road, people could buy everything from narcotics to forged passports and pay with bitcoins, affording buyers and sellers a greater degree of anonymity. The marketplace, which operated since 2011, was shut down last year. Lyn Ulbricht stood up briefly during Wilson\u2019s talk to thank those in attendance for supporting her son Ross, the alleged head of Silk Road. Ross, who is accused of using the online pseudonym \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d pleaded not guilty in federal court in New York last month to money-laundering, drug-trafficking and other charges. His parents relocated from Austin to New York to be closer to their son. \u201cHe is innocent,\u201d Lyn said. The basement bookstore, just a few blocks from the Texas State Capitol, doubles as headquarters for the state\u2019s Libertarian Party. On its shelves sit titles like \u201cMyth, Lies and Oil Wars\u201d and \u201cSecrets of the Federal Reserve.\u201d On the wall hangs political art, one drawing depicting top U.S. economic officials as \u201cfascists.\u201d A rotating display features bumper stickers. \u201cAnother American for gold, guns and The Constitution,\u201d one reads. The day included an Oxford-style debate on the relative merits of bitcoin vs other \u201calternative currencies\u201d like litecoin. One panel focused on women and bitcoin. Two young mothers held their babies and argued passionately about how bitcoin frees people from government influence. John Bush, who runs SovereignBTC.com, a bitcoin consulting firm, organized Sunday\u2019s session. \u201cBitcoin proves we don\u2019t need government to exchange value with one another,\u201d he said while holding his baby son William. Libertarians are particularly distrustful of the Federal Reserve, which they argue unfairly manipulates the value of the dollar through monetary measures like quantitative easing. Bitcoin \u201cundermines the banks and the state,\u201d he said. Two attendees came with assault rifles slung over their shoulders.\xa0But in the fight against the government, bitcoin is the weapon with more firepower, many argued. The Mt. Gox failure didn\u2019t appear to phase this group. \u201cAnarchists are excited\u201d about bitcoin, said Bush, who uses it to pay some of his employees. Wilson, the headline speaker, described bitcoin as \u201canti-fragile,\u201d capturing the determination of those in the room. \u201cI don\u2019t think we break\u201d when bitcoin is attacked by hackers, he said. \u201cI think we strengthen.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/RolfeWinkler', 'name': 'Rolfe Winkler', 'twitterhandle': '@RolfeWinkler', 'email': 'Rolfe Winkler'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/10/altsxsw-fired-up-about-bitcoin-in-a-bookstore-basement/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 10, 11, 56), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'#AltSXSW?

Most countries are casting a suspicious eye toward bitcoin and viewing cryptocurrencies as a potential threat. But one Lakota Indian hopes his nation will take a different approach: he hopes to make a digital currency the tribe\u2019s official currency. It\u2019s called mazacoin, and the man who developed it, Payu Harris, wants to make it the official currency of the Lakota Nation, a semi-autonomous North American Indian reservation in South Dakota. Officially launched in February, its market cap of $3.3 million places it 20th among alternative currencies (there are more than 200 \u201calt-coins,\u201d although most have marginal significance). Official adoption by the Lakota Nation would be a big development in the world of virtual currencies, because until now, the storyline for bitcoin alternatives has been \xa0about a small group of technophiles playing with a shiny new toy. But to Mr. Harris, the idea of a national currency represents something for which he\u2019s been striving for a long time: independence. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying tribal sovereignty since I was 16,\u201d said Mr. Harris, the Lakota who developed and is promoting mazacoin. \u201cTo be a truly independent state you have to have your own issued currency.\u201d Mr. Harris spoke to MoneyBeat from the Bitcoin Center in lower Manhattan. He rang the center\u2019s \u201copening bell\u201d on the Monday night open-pit trading session. David Pourier, a member of the Lakota\u2019s governing council, on Friday said he had never heard of mazacoin until he read about it in a local website. Mr. Pourier said the council has not made any proclamations about the currency. \u201cIt looks kind of like a scheme to me,\u201d he added. Mr. Harris feels otherwise. \u201cWhen I came across bitcoin,\u201d Mr. Harris said, \u201cI realized, this is our currency. This is what we need.\u201d He quickly sketched out the idea for a different version of it, and got support from developers in the digital-currency community. \u201cMazaska\u201d is the Lakota word for money, he said, and after tossing around several ideas, they settled on Mazacoin. He brought the idea to the tribe\u2019s leadership, and the economic development office\xa0reportedly gave him a letter of support. \u201cThis is for real,\u201d Mr. Harris said in his slight Midwest accent, although acknowledged it won\u2019t supplant dollar, or even bartering, overnight. There\u2019s going to be an outreach and education effort, and it\u2019s going to take time to convince merchants to accept it. But Mr. Harris, a 38-year old father who used to operate a video-rental store on the reservation, thinks in time it will have a positive effect on the Lakota. As a merchant, he said, he often engaged in barter with customers, who would offer trades when they had no money. He hopes that by adopting a digital currency, the Lakota can move into the digital age, and help shed decades of poverty. The effort abounds with ironies. For digital currency enthusiasts, for whom the idea of a currency without borders is an article of faith, the idea of a digital national currency is anathema. But the bitcoin community has been very supportive, Mr. Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re one tribe of cryptoheads,\u201d he said. And even if the Lakota do eventually call mazacoin their national currency, it remains to be seen whether it will be recognized elsewhere. The move is definitely being watched, though. Mr. Harris claims he has talked with officials from a range of U.S. agencies, including the Treasury Department and Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as a number of other tribes, and people from as far away as Ireland, Serbia, and Russia. It\u2019s also ironic that an Indian nation would be surging into the newest digital frontier. Unemployment on the Pine Ridge reservation runs north of 75%, per capita income is around $6,000; it\u2019s the poorest county in the U.S. Yet there was Mr. Harris on Monday, in the heart of the world\u2019s financial center (the Bitcoin Center is a block away from the NYSE), talking about the most cutting-edge, experimental financial technology around. \u201cI have a ridiculously huge smile on my face when I think about that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss the irony of that.\u201d To Mr. Harris, though, mazacoin is about much more than technology. The Lakota, who count the legendary Crazy Horse and Red Cloud among its ancestors, \xa0spent most of the 19th Century fighting the U.S. Its most significant victory came in 1866 when Red Cloud wiped out an Army battalion at Fort Kearny, forcing the U.S. to cede the territory to the Lakota. But by 1890 and the massacre at Wounded Knee, the Lakota were nearly wiped out. The tribe lives on in an archipelago of reservations, nominally independent but still under the aegis of the U.S. Rebuilding the nation and the people has been an ongoing effort. In 2007, they issued a\xa0Declaration of Indigenous Rights\xa0and drew up a map. Russell Means, a well-known activist and actor who died in 2012,\xa0renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2008. \u201cMazacoin is another link in the chain of sovereignty as we go into the 21st century,\u201d Mr. Harris said.

On Thursday, Newsweek reported that a California man named Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto may be\xa0the mysterious creator of bitcoin. A media circus ensued as Mr Nakamoto emerged from his house to a pack of reporters, jumped into a car with one of them, was followed by the rest as he headed into Los Angeles, and sat down for a two-hour interview with the Associated Press in which he denied being the founder of bitcoin. Then a message \xa0appeared on an Internet message board\xa0related to the P2P Foundation. It\xa0simply said \u201cI am not Dorian Nakamoto.\u201d What makes the message interesting is that it came on a page that was was first used in 2009 by the possibly pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto to initiate discussion about his bitcoin project. The name on the new message? Satoshi Nakamoto. It breaks a five-year silence from this user on that site. Josef Davies-Coates, who started the P2P Foundation website in 2008, told MoneyBeat that the email source for yesterday\u2019s message was the same email address listed in Nakamoto\u2019s initial paper on bitcoin\xa0from October 2008. It\u2019s a\xa0GMX email account, which is a service that allows a person to encrypt their email address. Mr. Davies-Coates said he has never spoken directly to that Nakamoto, hadn\u2019t heard anything from him after he dropped off the board, and has no idea who Nakamoto really is. He published a post on the foundation\u2019s blog detailing everything he knows up to this point. To take this a step further, it\u2019s even possible that Dorian Nakamoto could have written the post on the website attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto. After leaving the AP\u2019s offices midafternoon, he returned home (when he arrived is not exactly clear). The \u201cI am not Dorian Nakamoto\u201d post was made somewhere in the 5 p.m. hour, LA Time. For most of that hour, Mr. Namamoto was in his home, except for a brief time when he came outside to tell the reporters to go home. Either way, Mr. Davies-Coates had one definitive opinion about the whole episode. \u201cWe think that if Satoshi (whoever they are) wishes to remain anonymous, that ought to be respected,\u201d he wrote via email. \u201cDorian and his family could probably do with a break, too.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/07/did-the-real-satoshi-nakamoto-just-stand-up/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 7, 9, 43), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Did the Real Satoshi Nakamoto Just Stand Up?'}, {'articleText': u' The man who bears the title \u201cChief Scientist\u201d for the Bitcoin Foundation always believed Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 or whoever the real-life embodiment of bitcoin\u2019s mysterious founder was \u2013 to be a smart, reclusive computer scientist who was brilliant but sloppy in his coding style. \u201cI think he\u2019s an academic, maybe a post-doc, maybe a professor who just doesn\u2019t want the attention,\u201d said Gavin Andresen in an interview at his one-man office in Amherst, Mass., last month. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s proven anonymous.\u201d Mr. Andresen made those comments before a bombshell article in Newsweek Thursday claimed to have resolved the mystery surrounding the digital currency\u2019s founder and thrust the Bitcoin Foundation programmer into the spotlight himself\u2014albeit with less glare than the one now trained on the Temple City, Calif., house of a Japanese-American man. The report by Leah McGrath Goodman liberally quoted Mr. Andresen, who communicated with bitcoin\u2019s founder through chat rooms during the development of the digital currency\u2019s software code in 2010 and 2011. He now leads a global five-man team of core developers maintaining that software. After it was published, Mr. Andresen tweeted that he regretted talking to Ms. Goodman. That led some on Twitter to speculate that he was her main source. Ms. Goodman\u2019s article suggests, however, that her conclusions were based on her own research into California public records listing the names of \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d and \u201cDorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto\u201d and then drawing parallels with the descriptions of the founder\u2019s behavior provided by Mr. Andresen and others. Mr. Andresen, who is attending a financial cryptography conference in Barbados with other members of the Bitcoin Foundation this week, could not be reached for comment. Based on the interview last month, however, Mr. Andresen had always been as curious about the story of Nakamoto as anyone else. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating mystery,\u201d he said. \u201cWho is this guy who\u2019s created this system that\u2019s turned into a $10 billion software project? And nobody knows who is. Even I don\u2019t know who he, or she, or they are.\u201d Mr. Andresen is believed to be the last person among bitcoin programmers to communicate with the founder, whose involvement in the effort waned in early 2011 until he disappeared completely from the chat rooms in April of that year. But Mr. Andresen says he gleaned very little insight into the person, the only window being the hints left in the code by a programmer identified as \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto.\u201d\xa0 By Mr. Andresen\u2019s exacting standards, that code was pretty sloppy in parts. \u201cOver the course of 2010, I got drawn deeper and deeper into working on the core code, to help Satoshi out with patches,\u201d Mr. Andresen said. \u201cI mean, Satoshi is a brilliant programmer but he also acts like a lone wolf. So some of the standard software practices, like writing unit tests for your code, well when we started there was not a unit test to be found.\u201d\xa0 Mr. Andresen has since made such tests a routine task of the development team \u201cto make sure we don\u2019t break things.\u201d Mr. Andresen says he was chosen as the core development team\u2019s leader by the person identified as Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 with input as well from Jeff Garzik, another member of the team \u2014 in part because of his calm demeanor. Those qualities were put to the test last month when bugs that the founder had left in a part of the bitcoin program that communicates with the \u201cdigital wallets\u201d used by bitcoin trading exchanges were exploited in a global hacking attack that crippled the network for four days. It was \u201ca bug in Satoshi\u2019s code,\u201d Mr. Andersen said, and \u201cit was kind of hiding in plain sight.\u201d If the Newsweek article proves correct, Mr. Andresen will no longer himself be the subject of the speculation that frequently put him on a list of candidates cited as potentially being the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Even so, he\u2019d always had a straightforward retort to that: \u201cIf you ask a geek to look at some of the code I\u2019ve written in the past and look at Satoshi\u2019s early code they can tell it is written by two different people, a different writing style. I mean you can tell the difference between a Kurt Vonnegut novel and a Jackie Collins novel, or whatever. And so in the geek world, none of the geeks believe that I\u2019m Satoshi.

He turns out to be, surprisingly, a man named Satoshi Nakamoto. The reaction to the piece has been furious, in some cases literally. Bitcoiners are outraged that their beloved, previously mythological father-figure has been unmasked. Journalists, some of whom are now camped outside his California home, are trying to figure out how this guy was essentially hiding in plain sight. But one place where there has been almost no reaction to the story is in the price of bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is down 1.9%, at $649.56, and considering how cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility, that\u2019s essentially no reaction at all. Since briefly falling under $500 in the wake of the Mt.

Clearly, the interest is huge (among the sliver of the population that even knows what bitcoin is, that is). Nakamoto has been this shadowy figure. Think Kurtz from Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness.\u201d A crypto-Kurtz if you will. The anonymity gave him a larger than life persona, and indeed it fed into the mythology of bitcoin itself. We remember when we first started reporting in this space, we asked everybody we can into contact with the question: who is Satoshi Nakamoto? The most common answer we got was, of course, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d But almost everybody added a second answer: it doesn\u2019t matter. Nobody involved in bitcoin was very concerned about who Nakamoto was. All they cared about was the system that he created. The system is what they believed in. Does knowing who exactly Nakamoto is change bitcoin? The nonreaction in the price seems to say no. But it is a ripping good yarn. (Paul Vigna) - We\u2019re not exactly sure what to make of Charlie Shrem.\xa0The bitcoin pioneer, currently under house arrest in New York, addressed a group of the faithful at the Texas Bitcoin Conference, via a Skype connection. He delivered an unusual speech, and took questions from the crowd for about 20 minutes. He cast himself in particular and bitcoin in general in the light of the oppressed, and delved deep into history, back to the printing press and Galileo and the Church\u2019s stranglehold on \u201cthe truth.\u201d We\u2019re not sure how many he managed to convince. We are sure of one thing, though: his lawyers can\u2019t be happy. (Paul Vigna) - It\u2019s not exactly Live Aid, or Farm Aid, but if you got goxxed by Mt. Gox, help is on the way. The bitcoin mining company CloudHashing.com has announced a \u201crelief effort\u201d on behalf of Mt. Gox customers, offering discount mining contracts to customers of the collapsed exchange. They are hoping, too, to spur others in the community to help customers of the notorious exchange. Okay, so it\u2019s a bit self-serving. Getting new customers from anywhere is always a priority for a for-profit company. But still, the company says it\u2019s doing this \u201cbecause we want to bring the community together,\u201d said Lukas Gilkey, director of business development, who says he lost $40,000 at Mt. Gox, and \u201cwe want to challenge the bitcoin community to circle the wagons.\u201d So, Gox\u2019ers, for this month, CloudHasing is offering a discount rate of $8 per gigahash for a one-year contract. That\u2019s down from $9. \u201cWe are a very-like minded people who are very supportive of each other,\u201d said director of public relations Michael Hatfield. (Paul Vigna) - For all the attention bitcoin gets from the press (i.e., us), fewer than 1% of people online have used bitcoin for purchases, a new study from Forrester/Bizrate finds, even as public awareness of it rises. But what matters, the report says, isn\u2019t how many people are using it, but \u201cwhat this digital currency represents for the future of global payments and commerce.\u201d On that front, they see cyrptocurrencies as a very significant development. \u201cBitcoin as a brand may never reach mainstream consumer adoption,\u201d writes the study\u2019s authors,\xa0Denee Carrington and Sucharita Mulpuru. \u201cHowever, incumbents in the global payments ecosystem should consider the emergence of Bitcoin and crypto-currencies more broadly as an early warning siren of more innovation to come \u2014 that will completely transform today\u2019s payments systems.\u201d Now, they\u2019re not the first ones to says that, of course. But Forrester is a well-known market research firm, a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq exchange. This report, therefore, wasn\u2019t written for consumers or journalists, and certainly not for the bitcoin faithful, but for corporate professionals. It\u2019s one more bit of evidence that the big boys are taking digital currencies seriously. The report ain\u2019t cheap, either. You can buy it online, for $499. There\u2019s no indication you can pay in bitcoin.

The home was quiet for most of the morning, with the curtains drawn. But outside, a modest media scrum was forming after Newsweek reported that Mr. Nakamoto, a 64-year old man with a passion for model trains, was the shadowy creator of bitcoin. At one point, an elderly woman left the home with a caretaker who said she was just there to take the older woman to an appointment. Neither woman responded to questions about Mr. Nakamoto. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this is all about,\u201d said the companion, helping the older woman into the back seat of a green four-door vehicle. Later, a man who looked like the person Newsweek had identified as Mr. Nakamoto came out of the house, approached the gathered journalists, and demanded a free \u201cexpensive\u201d lunch at a local sushi place while speaking briefly with reporters\u2013 most of whom assumed he was making a joke. An Associated Press reporter offered to buy him a meal. The two pushed through the scrum, got into his car, and took off. But not before the man told reporters: \u201cI have nothing to do with this.\u201d What followed was a long, slow-motion chase through Temple City neighborhoods as a line of reporters followed the AP car with Mr. Nakamoto inside. The pair got out at a sushi restaurant, then left, with reporters still in pursuit. The pair then drove through Temple City neighborhoods for 30 minutes, with a caravan of reporters following. Then they got onto LA\u2019s freeways, with reporters still in pursuit, and drove downtown until they reached the AP offices, where Mr. Nakamoto continued to deny any involvement in bitcoin, but agreed to tell his story only to AP. It was a welcome flurry of activity after a quiet morning. The Nakamoto home is situated in a quiet suburb in the heart of the San Gabriel Valley, a working class region with a large population of Chinese immigrants, known for its good schools. Most people in the neighborhood had never heard of bitcoin, and neighbors said they didn\u2019t know the family, saying most in the neighborhood kept to themselves. But the media scrum also attracted a few locals who were familiar with the virtual currency and were shocked to learn that its purported creator appeared to be living modestly and undetected in Temple City. \u201cIt\u2019s so quiet here. There\u2019s never much going on,\u201d said Andy Scauzillo, a 22-year old from the neighborhood who walked over to the Nakamoto house when he heard the bitcoin founder might live there. \u201cI was surprised that he\u2019s here.\u201d Mr. Scauzillo, who said he knows about the currency, took a photo of the home on his phone to show to some of his friends who \u201care more into it.\u201d Peter Lam, another neighbor, said the family is private. \u201cThey\u2019re good people, good neighbors,\u201d Mr. Lam said, driving by the house in a white SUV. Mr. Lam had never heard of bitcoin before, and said he didn\u2019t know what Mr. Nakamoto did for work. \u201cIs this good?\u201d Mr. Lam asked when informed of bitcoin. \u201cWe have wealthy people moving to Temple City,\u201d he said, handing out his business cards to reporters. \u201cCall me if you want a house.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/06/street-scene-most-of-nakamotos-neighbors-havent-heard-of-bitcoin/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 6, 14, 49), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Street Scene: Most of Nakamoto&rsquo;s Neighbors Haven&rsquo;t Heard of Bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u' Newsweek claims to have fingered Satoshi Nakamoto, the shadowy figure who created bitcoin in the last decade and simply disappeared into the ether as it took off.

Ms. Goodman stitches together the details of this man\u2019s life and the few known details about the creator of bitcoin and concludes they are one and the same.

It seemed similarly implausible that Nakamoto\u2019s first response to my knocking at his door would be to call the cops. Now face to face, with two police officers as witnesses, Nakamoto\u2019s responses to my questions about Bitcoin were careful but revealing. Tacitly acknowledging his role in the Bitcoin project, he looks down, staring at the pavement and categorically refuses to answer questions. \u201cI am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,\u201d he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. \u201c \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/06/is-this-satoshi-nakamoto/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 6, 9, 9), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Is This Satoshi Nakamoto, the Mysterious Creator of Bitcoin?'}, {'articleText': u' Deals of the Day is back!

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$657.01, down 1% \xa0(via\xa0CoinDesk) -\xa0French finance minister Pierre Moscovici warned his fellow countrymen to be \u201cvery vigilant\u201d when using bitcoin or other currencies, and suggested the entire thing should be brought up at the regular meeting of EU finance ministers, the Ecofin, for examination, as relayed to us by our colleague Willaim Horobin in Paris. According to a press release from the ministry: \u201cMr. Moscovici repeated that the rules protecting consumers and investors don\u2019t apply efficiently to assets held in virtual currencies\u2014particularly bitcoins\u2014and called on French people to be very vigilant when holding or using them. Faced with the risks of fraud and money laundering associated with these currencies\u2014which circulate in a particularly opaque way and can act as a medium for illicit activity\u2014Mr. Moscovici announced he intends to take the question to members of the EU for it to be examined by the European Council.\u201d We don\u2019t know yet whether that request has been formalized, but it would seem at some point, the question of digital currencies would have to be addressed by the EU. So far, the issue of digital currencies in Europe has been addressed only at the country level. The French have been rather vocal about their opposition to bitcoin. In December, the Bank of France published a paper warning of the dangers of virtual currencies. They have since translated it into English, which you can read here. \xa0(Paul Vigna) -\xa0Crystal ball gazing: Are crypto-fiat currencies in our future?\xa0We see a social and political showdown arising between those worried about the dangers of bitcoin\u2019s seemingly lawless turmoil and those who believe its groundbreaking technology will transform our global financial system. In the end, we reckon government will do what it always does and negotiate a compromise, one that could embrace the innovation but steer its growth away from bitcoin itself. In fact, the end game, we think, could be a digital dollar \u2013 a bit-buck, if you will, or a crypto-back.

Gox bankruptcy story: It will be like no other bankruptcy case before it. (Paul Vigna) - Make way for the Winklenauts. Tyler Winklevoss says in a post on the Winklevoss Capital blog that he and his equally famous twin brother, Cameron, have used some of their extensive holdings of bitcoin to purchase spaceflight tickets on Virgin Galactic. If this strikes you as a promotional gimmick, it probably is. But that\u2019s precisely what bitcoin wants if it is to generate buzz and expand adoption. (Hey, BitBeat took the bait.) The more positive human-interest stories that circulate around bitcoin \u2014 in contrast to Mt. Gox, Silk Road or hacking attack stories \u2014 \xa0the greater the public awareness, the better the chances for the digital currency\u2019s mainstream adoption. You have to hand it to the Winklevii, as the pair has come to be known. They\u2019ve parlayed their high-profile legal battle with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, made famous in the movie the \u201cSocial Network,\u201d into a powerful personal brand. And with Wednesday\u2019s announcement, they leveraged the power of an even bigger master of self-branding, including in the blog post a photo of themselves with Virgin CEO Sir Richard Branson. Mr. Branson made waves in November, when he said his space tourism unit would accept bitcoin for tickets \u2013 current value $250,000 each, in case you\u2019re in the market. The rising Winklebrand is now closely associated with bitcoin, in which they have tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of personal holdings as well as investments in related businesses, such as a prospective bitcoin investment trust. (They also invested in BitInstant, whose CEO, Charlie Shrem, who is now under house arrest on money laundering charges.)

Now, an Icelandic techie who is trying to undo the legacy of that financial disaster has achieved something similar in the digital-currency world \u2014 except in this case it\u2019s founded on ideas antithetical to the old, too-big-to-fail banking model behind that 2008 crisis. His invention, a so-called \u201calt.coin\u201d known as auroracoin, has rocketed into second place among the most valuable independent digital currencies after bitcoin \u2013 albeit amid a rollercoaster ride in its price. According to coinmarketcap.com, auroracoin \u2013 whose 10.6 million \u201cpre-mined\u201d coins are currently valued at $39.71 each \u2013 has a market capitalization of $381 million. Although that\u2019s down a whopping 51% from its level on Tuesday, it\u2019s still up by 1,100% from Thursday. Until \xa0Wednesday afternoon, it was even ahead of litecoin, whose capitalization was last quoted $423 million and has held the title among alt.coins as the \u201csilver to bitcoin\u2019s gold.\u201d Bitcoin, the grand-daddy virtual currency, weighs in at $8.3 billion. (This ranking excludes the digital currency Ripple, whose market cap of $1.6 billion does not make for a fair comparison. Most ripple coins are retained by the issuing entity under a centrally managed model that\u2019s very different from the decentralized networks employed by other alt.coins.) How did little Iceland achieve this? One factor: auroracoin has an instant mass market. Its creator, who goes under the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar Odinsson, plans to make a virtual \u201cairdrop\u201d on March 25, granting 31.8 auroracoins to each and every one of the 330,000 people listed in a national ID database. Already, Icelanders represent one of the most wired and technologically literate populations in the world. So, the bet among investors is that this fledgling currency is ripe for mass adoption. It also sets the country up as kind of laboratory for the use of cryptocurrencies generally. The project is a direct response to Iceland\u2019s strict capital controls, which the government initially vowed would be a temporary measure during the turmoil of 2008 but which are still in place more than five years later. They severely restrict Icelanders\u2019 ability to get money in and out of their country. Meanwhile, the government has struggled to protect the value of its currency, the krona, a failure that auroracoin\u2019s web site illustrates with an image of the new 10,000-kronur note morphing into a one-hundred-trillion-dollar Zimbabwean note.\xa0 Auroracoin is presented as a way for Icelanders to escape this currency trap. \u201cThe whole point of auroracoin is to provide Icelanders with an alternative to the kr\xf3na, a currency they are forced by pain of imprisonment to use,\u201d said the pseudonymous Mr. Odinsson in an email exchange. \u201cIcelanders will be free to sell auroracoins anywhere they like and buy anything they like, be it dollars or other foreign currency on offshore currency exchanges. They won\u2019t need permission from the Central Bank or politicians.\u201d As for the pseudonym \u2013 a tactic reminiscent of that of Bitcoin\u2019s mysterious, unidentified creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, auroracoin\u2019s founder says, \u201cThe agents of the state will attack anyone challenging their power, so I chose a name from Norse mythology to shield myself from such attacks.\u201d\xa0 He notes that Icelandic central bank officials have spoken out against cryptocurrencies and the government has adopted a hostile posture toward bitcoin. In Norse mythology, Baldur was the son of Odin, chief of the Gods, and Frigg, a benevolent sorceress. He described on norse-mythology.org as \u201cone of the most beloved of all the gods\u2026 a generous, joyful and courageous character\u201d who was killed by the \u201cwily and disloyal\u201d god of Loki. Whether any of that contains relevance for auroracoin, Mr. Odinsson isn\u2019t entirely happy with how speculators have driven his currency up 2400% and then halved it, all in the space of six days.\xa0On the one hand, the price gain could encourage some people to adopt and use the currency. On the other, sharp declines and price swings could scare others off. \u201cPersonally, I would have wanted to see a more gradual rise in the value of auroracoin,\u201d the creator said in the email.

Gox bankruptcy case: It won\u2019t be like any other bankruptcy case you\u2019ve \xa0seen. MoneyBeat had a very enlightening and interesting talk with Christopher Mirick, a partner at the international law firm\xa0Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, operating in the firm\u2019s Insolvency & Restructuring practice. He is also one of two educational directors at American Bankruptcy Institute\u2019s international committee and co-author of the book \u201cStrategies for Creditors in Bankruptcy Proceedings.\u201d One point he made, that seems obvious in retrospect, is that there\u2019s never quite been a bankruptcy case like this one. It involves a new technology, a company that seemed to operate with only a few employees and almost no presence in the countries across the globe where it did business, and questions of cross-border bankruptcy law. What follows is a paraphrased version of our conversation. How messy is this bankruptcy going to be? It\u2019s going to be \u201cvery messy,\u201d Mr. Mirick\xa0said. There are a couple of things to think about. For one thing, Mt. Gox has creditors all over the world. Of their roughly 130,000 creditors, only about 1,000 are in Japan. According to Mt. Gox, they don\u2019t have U.S. bank accounts. \u201cSo what\u2019s a person in Illinois going to get? There\u2019s nothing there,\u201d Mr.\xa0Mirick\xa0said.\xa0\xa0Mt. Gox did business in a lot of places where it didn\u2019t have any physical existence. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to recover?\u201d Is your firm involved in the case? Mr.\xa0Mirick\xa0said this kind of case would be \u201cup our alley,\u201d but the firm isn\u2019t currently involved, although it does have a Tokyo office. \u201cBut we would jump at the chance.\u201d Why\u2019s that? \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a case like this.\u201d It involves a cutting-edge technology, and questions about cross-border enforcement of bankruptcy proceedings. Mr.\xa0Mirick pointed to\xa0Lehman Brothers, for comparison [a case that, we\u2019d note is still being settled.] Unlike Mt. Gox, Lehman had entities in each jurisdiction where they operated. \u201cThis [Mt. Gox] is just like a couple of guys with some computers who happened to be in Japan, and handling half a billion dollars that went missing.\u201d What can a creditor hope to recover? Mr.\xa0Mirick\xa0said creditors of Mt. Gox should be looking for a way to track the money and bring it back, if possible. They should also examine the timeline, for when the money first disappeared, he said. Was it three months ago? Six? \u201cIf they were making payments during that time, maybe you could claw some of that back.\u201d From the creditors\u2019 point of view, Mr. Mirick said, somebody has to be blamed, whether it\u2019s the Mark Karpeles, the directors, or the officers.\xa0That person or people may have insurance, if not assets, and creditors may be able to go after that, he added. \u201cBut, for a company without physical assets, the ability to get a recovery is quite limited.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/05/mt-goxs-bankruptcy-case-will-be-unlike-any-other/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 5, 12, 36), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Mt.

News of bankrupt exchanges losing hundreds of millions of customers\u2019 dollars, worldwide hacking attacks and drug-related arrests can do that to you. Well, might I interest you in some bit-bucks instead? You can call them e-backs, if you like, or digital dollars. Despite the triumphalism of bitcoin\u2019s naysayers this past week, crypto-currencies aren\u2019t doomed. You can\u2019t suppress an innovation that permits global, low-cost peer-to-peer transactions and which renders obsolete the rent-seeking intermediaries of a cumbersome international payments system. It\u2019s just that for all bitcoin\u2019s quirky charms, it might not be the best driver for this technology. So, where does this process go? It\u2019s a ways off, but the end game could be the digitalization of fiat currencies, those creaky government-backed forms of paper money that bitcoin vows to disrupt. If so, get ready for a new world order. A digital dollar would alarm crypto-currency enthusiasts who see privately developed digital currencies\u2013 backed not by a government but by consensus-building networks of computer owners\u2013as an escape from the curse of paper currencies. They warn that profligate politicians and self-interested bankers habitually debase national currencies and lump citizens with the bill by way of inflation, lost purchasing power and unaccountable government. However, Average Joes are now also looking warily at these techies\u2019 newfangled alternatives\u2013evident in the comments stream on stories about last week\u2019s collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. Ordinary folk have been burned by both Washington and Wall Street, but at least they understand those animals, or think they do. How are they to trust a complicated collection of bits and bytes that\u2019s \u201cmined\u201d by a network of anonymous computers and exploited by geeks via offshore, unregulated and highly unstable exchanges? Above all, money is about trust. Still, mind-blowing new digital-currency ideas seem to arrive daily, bitcoin-based sales are growing steadily, and serious institutional investors are unveiling plans for large-scale, regulated exchanges. Financial innovation is unstoppable, which means society is headed for a showdown. It will pit the innovators, armed with a technology that promises to slash costs and integrate billions of human beings into a more efficient global financial system, against the likes of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.), who wants to ban bitcoin. Inevitably, governments will negotiate a compromise. And it could be that they actually join the crypto-currency revolution. Canada is already experimenting with a digital version of its dollar, the so-called MintChip. But the real game-changer would be a digital U.S. dollar. And if that becomes entrenched, \u201cnational borders are not going to have much meaning anymore,\u201d says Cornell professor and former IMF economist Eswar Prasad. If their citizens can obtain and use a digital version of the world\u2019s most sought-after currency by clicking a mouse, countries like China, Russia and Argentina will find it harder to insulate their financial systems with capital controls. They\u2019d try to censor the Internet or ban access to foreign currency, but the digital dollar would eventually seep in to supplant the yuan, ruble or peso for internal and external commerce. \u201cThe walls that countries try to put up around capital inflows and outflows, those are going to disappear very, very quickly,\u201d said Mr. Prasad, whose new book, \u201cThe Dollar Trap,\u201d explains how the greenback came to dominate the global economy. And that\u2019s not all. Central banks could use digital fiat currencies to get around the \u201czero-bound\u201d problem that forced them into massive money-printing programs once they\u2019d cut interest rates to zero after the 2008 financial crisis, says Mr. Prasad. If digital currencies were to fully replace their paper equivalents, he adds, central banks could tax bank accounts\u2013effectively setting a negative rate\u2013since depositors could no longer flee the taxman by storing dollars under the mattress. For sure, the idea of an all-powerful central bank literally cutting your savings is horrendous for those who trumpet bitcoin\u2019s independence. But it is arguably preferable to endless \u201cquantitative easing\u201d programs, which have lined the pockets of financiers but failed to create jobs for tens of millions. Right now, interest rates below inflation are already eroding the dollar\u2019s spending power. But although that\u2019s effectively the same as nominally reducing savings, households and businesses typically don\u2019t perceive the same loss of value, making it harder for central banks to incentivize spending, stimulate the economy and create jobs. And inflation is unevenly distributed across society. Negative interest rates would be a fairer and more effective tool. \u201cIf your money is literally eroding, there is a very powerful incentive to use it,\u201d says Mr. Prasad. Still, if you don\u2019t trust the Federal Reserves to make such decisions, this is horrible, right? Well, the good news for libertarian bitcoiners is that it\u2019s possible to create private, digital alternatives to fiat currencies. In the future, the Fed won\u2019t be held to account by bank lobbyist-funded Congressmen but by a global marketplace in which anyone can issue a competing currency. Bitcoin\u2019s recent problems have enlivened its critics. But the revolution it unleashed is only just beginning. \u2013 Follow Michael J. Casey on Twitter:\xa0@mikejcasey.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$658.25, down 0.4% \xa0(via\xa0CoinDesk) - We were asked to do a couple of TV and radio interviews on bitcoin last week, when Mt. Gox was imploding. One thing that occurred to us later was that we need to have a very quick explanation of what bitcoin actually is if we\u2019re going to be doing these on a regular basis.\xa0\xa0It\u2019s going to be a common question and, in a four-minute segment, you have little time to answer it. We raise this issue here for a few reasons. One is that since most people still aren\u2019t familiar with bitcoin, this is a question that will continue to be raised, and must be answered. A handy, quick definition is good for us as journalists, and might be of interest to you bitcoiners out there, too. Another reason is that we want to get your thoughts on the matter. It\u2019s no academic exercise. The question of what bitcoin is\xa0is still an open question. Is it a currency? A commodity? The definition is still hazy. Even the Winklevoss twins struggled to explain it simply. This is what we\u2019re thinking: \u201cThe dollar is essentially a payments system. Bitcoin is as well. It facilitates trade between parties online directly. It allows payments to be sent anywhere in the world, bypassing banks and other third parties. The system is maintained not by a government but by the community of users itself. Every transaction is kept in a public ledger that must be verified by the community.\u201d We read that back to ourselves and timed it at 15.5 seconds. Granted, we\u2019re east coasters and tend to talk fast but think that\u2019s both compact and comprehensive. It doesn\u2019t answer every question. From there you would likely be peppered with a bunch of other questions. But we think that\u2019s a good starting point for any conversation. \u201cBitcoin is a payments system\u201d is a cleaner concept than \u201cbitcoin is a currency.\u201d Maybe we\u2019re wrong about that. Importantly, we don\u2019t want to immediately go off into the reeds with jargon or talk of blockchains and hash rates (look at that Winklevoss explanation again). We want this to be as clear as possible. So, what do you think? (Paul Vigna) - If you\u2019re bringing your digital wallet to South by Southwest, the annual music and pop culture festival in Austin, Texas, you\u2019re in luck: Bitcoin will be there. BitPay, the payment-processor startup, will have an interactive exhibit at the festival, manned by staffers who will field questions. Co-founder and CEO Tony Gallippi will also be on hand and speaking during two panel sessions. BitPay\u2019s booth is number 1417. - Blockchain acquired the bitcoin trading platform RTBTC, and will combine it with its ZeroBlock app to create a comprehensive trading platform comprising data, charting, trading, and news. The company described it as the \u201cBloomberg of bitcoin.\u201d - Overstock, which started accepting bitcoin in early January,\xa0reported that it has sold more than $1 million worth of goods that have been paid for in bitcoin. The retailer said it\u2019s had about 4,300 customers use the bitcoin option, and about 60% of them were new customers. \u201cWe did not expect to his this milestone so quickly,\u201d Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said in a release. \u201cBitcoin customers are good customers, and we\u2019re pleased to provide them this service.\u201d Overstock saw sales of $1.3 billion in 2013, so the bitcoin business is still a small part of its overall sales. Still, Mr. Byrne said he expects bitcoin-related sales to hit $10-$15 million this year. - The bitcoin world has suffered another bank failure. Flexcoin, which billed itself as the \u201cbitcoin bank,\u201d shut its virtual doors after it reported a theft of 896 BTC, \u201call coins in the hot wallet,\u201d according to a statement on its site. \u201cAs Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately.\u201d - Lastly, we sat down last week with John Barrett and Lij Shaw for their Bitcoins & Gravy podcast. These are the same guys who did the \u201cOde to Satoshi\u201d song. It\u2019s worth a listen to, even beyond our humble contribution.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$655.42, up 46.98% \xa0(via\xa0CoinDesk) -The sleuths are digging hard into Mt. Gox\u2019s situation. But for now it seems Friday\u2019s stunning announcement that the exchange was declaring bankruptcy after losing a whopping 850,000 bitcoins has raised many more questions than answers. Investors were given what appeared to be a chance to ask those questions when Tokyo-based Mt. Gox opened a call center Monday for access within Japanese business hours. But calling the number proved mostly fruitless for a number of contributors an online forum on Reddit. Mt. Gox was not immediately available for comment. \u201cI\u2019ve got some hold music. It is quite soothing, but I still want my money back,\u201d posted one Reddit user with the tag \u201cwillldcc.\u201d Other Reddit users went in to a lengthy discussion about the music. Reddit user \u201cisskewl\u201d pointed out that one piece was from \u201cTake the Money and Run\u201d by the Steve Miller Band. Another Reddit user, \u201ccokea,\u201d posted an assessment of each of the 10 songs they heard. Finally, cokea added a recording of \xa0an almost three-minute conversation with what appeared to be a Japanese operator. A man\u2019s voice with what sounds like a French accent can be heard asking if the \u201ccoins are stolen or lost,\u201d to which a woman\u2019s voice with a Japanese accent responds, \u201cI\u2019m sorry this is a call center. I cannot tell you the situation. If you\u2019d like to know more, the information will be updated on our web site.\u201d \xa0The conversation concludes with the operator saying she will pass the question onto \u201cthe person in charge of the company.\u201d The recording could not be independently verified. That person in charge would be Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox\u2019s embattled chief executive officer.\xa0 Mr. Karpeles could not immediately be reached for comment and has not commented publicly since announcing the bankruptcy on Friday. As amateur sleuths weave their way through the bitcoin public ledger, known as the blockchain, to try find the missing coins, many are arguing that the claim that they\u2019ve been lost or stolen doesn\u2019t add up. They find it incredulous that such a gross level of possible mismanagement of customer funds could have occurred. It would have required the exchange to leave a massive amount of those funds in vulnerable \u201chot wallets\u201d when they should have been locked away offline in \u201ccold storage\u201d to prevent hackers and thieves from getting access. Such protections are part of Bitcoin Security 101, they say. In fact, if the loss occurred over many years, as early explanations from Mt. Gox indicated, the idea that they went unnoticed seems even harder to understand. \u201cIt\u2019s like you live in a house and brick by brick somebody comes and steals your entire house from under you while you\u2019re doing business in it and you never notice,\u201d said Adam B. Levine, editor in chief of letstalkbitcoin.com. \u201cI mean it should have been just so obvious.\u201d Last week, Mr. Levine joined a team of four other researchers to sift through bitcoin transactions, which they say led them to find 90,000 coins still situated in what they say is a Mt. Gox account \u2013 in contradiction with the exchange\u2019s claim that the money is gone. That account was traced to a June 2011 maneuver in which Mr. Karpeles moved 424,424 bitcoins between digital wallets in public view, all to prove to the bitcoin community that a prior hacking attack \xa0had not left his exchange insolvent, Mr. Levine said. Meanwhile, other users on Reddit and elsewhere claim to have found even more coins tied to Mt. Gox. Whether their conclusions are correct, these people say the ledger shows no trace of the \u201ctransaction malleability\u201d problems that Mt. Gox early in February blamed for its mounting financial troubles. Transaction malleability refers to a quirk in the underlying bitcoin software that allows some users to alter the ID code on completed transactions and, in some cases, submit fraudulent claims for repayment on the grounds they weren\u2019t paid. Many in the bitcoin community later responded that transaction malleability was a known problem and that Mt. Gox merely had to implement customer support protocols to protect itself from any rogue actors exploiting it. Mt. Gox has so far not responded to those criticisms. (Michael Casey)\xa0 Bitcoin jumped almost 17% against the dollar Monday.\xa0After a week of trauma that concluded with Mt. Gox\u2019s dramatic bankruptcy, it was a striking comeback for the embattled digital currency. Bitcoin\u2019s price in dollars was last quoted on up 16.98% at $655.42 Monday, according to the Coindesk index. The move was variously ascribed to bigger players supporting the price, the political crisis in the Ukraine, and the bitcoin industry\u2019s general relief that it can now put Mt. Gox\u2019s troubles behind it. The move also follows a tough February, in which bitcoin\u2019s price fell as much as 45% in three weeks to an intraday low of $462.98 on Tuesday. \u201cThat was not the biggest flushing out that bitcoin has had \u2026and if you look at most of the ups and downs that over the years they\u2019ve typically had Mt. Gox surrounding it,\u201d said Michael Terpin, co-founder of bitcoin industry-dedicated angel investor pool BitAngels. \xa0\u201cI think we can now move to a more mature marketplace where Gox is not the be all and end all.\u201d Mr. Terpin added the flight from risky assets seen Monday in traditional markets following Russia\u2019s incursions into the Ukraine also fits with prior patterns of a pickup in demand for bitcoin. He cited the crisis in Cyprus last year, when bitcoin\u2019s price surged after that country\u2019s leaders deployed a plan backed by the European Union to put a tax on bank deposits, and gains that accompanied the budget standoff in the U.S. Data provided by bigterminal.com showing the largest volume in a week led some to argue that a few big players in the market stepped into support the price once it showed signs of stabilizing. This could not be confirmed.\xa0(Michael Casey) - The Chicago Sun-Times is taking bitcoin for another spin. The Windy City tabloid, which conducted an experiment with a bitcoin paywall back in February, is experimenting again. The paper, in a promotion it\u2019s undertaking along with bitcoin mining-equipment company KnC Miner, will be giving away 100,000 wallets to local Chicagoans, replete with a nominal amount of bitcoin to get them started. The offer will be going out along with today\u2019s physical paper. The first 1,000 people to sign up will get a wallet with $5 in it; everybody else gets a wallet with $1 in it. For KnC Miner, it represents a new phase in its business. This will be the first time it\u2019s offering a product for the general consumer. Called KnC Wallet, the product runs as an app on Android-designed smartphones. The app is available for download now, apart from the Sun-Times offer. \u201cWe want to make bitcoin easier to use, easier to adopt, and encourage more people to find the benefits of using bitcoins,\u201d \xa0Sam Cole, co-founder of KnC Miner, told MoneyBeat. The idea behind the Sun-Times offer, he said, was to create a hotspot of sorts. \u201cOne-hundred thousand worldwide is not much,\u201d he said. \u201cOne-hundred thousand in one spot is significant.\u201d If a small cluster of people in one place are trading with each other and spending their bitcoins, he said, it creates a more active community. And while the ostensible reason is to broaden the appeal and raise awareness of bitcoin, the industry will now have a company that sells both mining equipment and wallets, an interesting bit of vertical integration, if you will. For the Sun-Times, it\u2019s another step deeper into digital currencies. The paper was very pleased with its February paywall experiment, and intimated to MoneyBeat that it would be exploring other ways to make use of bitcoin in its operations. As of right now, the paper doesn\u2019t have an option to pay with bitcoin, so this seems more like a goodwill effort than an anything else. Still, it puts them one step further ahead as the only major U.S. paper to have some kind of relationship with digital currency. (Paul Vigna) - Given his famous and long-standing advice to investors that they invest in things they understand and use, maybe it isn\u2019t so surprising that Warren Buffett is not a bitcoin fan. The avuncular investor said that bitcoin is \u201cnot a currency\u201d in a CNBC interview this morning, and added he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it wasn\u2019t around in 10 or 20 years. - He\u2019s not as well known as Mr. Buffett, few are, but Peter Morici, the University of Maryland professor who\u2019s got a side-gig as a Kyocera pitchman, took bitcoin out behind the proverbial woodshed in an opinion piece. \u201cIt is no place for your children\u2019s college fund or retirement savings,\u201d he wrote, making the case that it\u2019s, well, not a real currency. \u201cIt\u2019s not the gold but the face of Caesar\u2014the promise his image carries\u2014that makes a coin money.\u201d - If you\u2019re interested in a good, thorough treatment of bitcoin from an outsider\u2019s perspective, we suggest this explainer from American Banker.

Gox has gone big-time, which is what tends to happen when you collapse and somehow manage to lose nearly half a billion of your customers\u2019 monies. Unfortunately, it hit the Great White Way for all the wrong reasons. It\u2019s another ignominious moment for bitcoin, yes, but it may not be the end of bitcoin, as so many seem to think. \u201cIt\u2019s an expected development,\u201d\xa0\xa0Moshe Cohen, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, said this morning on the MoneyBeat show. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn our heads and give up on it because it was not implemented the right way.\u201d At this point, bitcoiners will use this as an opportunity to develop a better product, with improved verification and security measures, he said. There\u2019s also a chance here for the alt-coins, like Ripple and Namecoin, to take some virtual-market share, he said, but bitcoin still has a big first-mover advantage.

Gox Files for Bankruptcy Protection Bitsleuths Start Hunt for Mt. Gox\u2019s Missing Bitcoin Mt. Gox Could Follow Japan Bankruptcy With U.S. Case A Look at the Man in Charge - Fortress Investment Group has been buying bitcoin.\xa0In its most recent 10-K filing with the SEC, the firm has a line-item entry on its balance sheet for bitcoin. It appears under the consolidated statement of cash flows, under cash flows from investing activities. Wouldn\u2019t ya know it, too, they lost money. Fortress bought $20 million worth of bitcoin \u2014 the line-item entry is \u201cdigital currency (bitcoin)\u201d \u2014 in 2013. Under a note to the consolidated statement, it listed a $3.7 million unrealized loss on its bitcoin investment, and values its bitcoins at $16.3 million. You can read the filing here. To be sure, that $20 million investment is less than 1% of Fortress\u2019s $2.6 billion in assets. Additionally, despite rumors to the contrary, a source familiar with the matter tells BitBeat that the firm has no plans for a Fortress-managed bitcoin fund. Still, this is a notable milestone for the digital currency. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, this is the first public company to report ownership of bitcoin,\u201d said Gil Luria, managing director or equity research at Wedbush Securities, who alerted us to the filing. \u201cIt means lawyers, accountants, and auditors have developed a blueprint for how it gets reported.\u201d Mr. Luria, whose firm started selling bitcoin-related research reports online, accepting bitcoin of course, thinks this is a significant development, even if the amount is small. \u201cI\u2019m happy to say Fortress has outdone us by owning bitcoin. They\u2019ve made it easier for us to do so as well.\u201d He said their own experiment in bitcoin, which he called an \u201cimportant technology for the future,\u201d is going well. (Paul Vigna) - Elsewhere in bitcoin, Coinbase hit a new milestone: the bitcoin exchange reported that it crossed the 1 million mark in terms of consumer wallets (or accounts, if you\u2019re not up on the parlance.) Founded in 2012, the company had 13,000 accounts at the beginning of 2013, which works out to a 7,592% growth rate. Even for the bitcoin world, that\u2019s a pretty torrid rate. \u201cIt\u2019s been stressful but pretty exciting,\u201d CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong told BitBeat. The company\u2019s been adding new accounts at a rate of about 31% a month, which they expect will continue if not increase. Every estimate they\u2019ve made, he said, has proven too small. Keeping up with that growth rate, he said, \u201chas been quite an effort.\u201d They are hiring rapidly, but they aren\u2019t spending a lot to draw in customers. Mr. Armstrong noted the growth on the consumer side has been \u201c100% organic,\u201d they have not spent a dime (or a satoshi for that matter), on marketing. The merchant side of the business is just starting to take off, he said. In 2013, Coinbase saw a lot of interest from merchants, but not much in the way of actual business. Over the past four months, that has changed \u201cdramatically.\u201d Interest has gone up \u201ctwentyfold,\u201d and they are working on five or six \u201clarge scale\u201d integrations. He declined to name the merchants involved. Coinbase previously worked with Overstock to integrate bitcoin into its payments system. Of course, it is a somewhat bittersweet milestone, he acknowledged, given everything happening at Mt. Gox. But like most of the people we talk to in the bitcoin community, he was undeterred. \u201cThe industry is going to get a lot stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cThe industry is growing up.\u201d He pointed out that Coinbase has backing from venture capitalists (it raised $25 million in December), and there are more companies like that now. \u201cIt\u2019s quickly becoming a game for professional companies.\u201d Mr. Armstrong and Coinbase are part of a \u201cgroup of six\u201d exchanges that issued a statement earlier this week pledging to improve transparency and industry standards. Mr. Armstrong said the group has met informally to discuss ideas, one of which was transparency, something that was a glaring weakness at Mt. Gox. \u201cOne of the first ideas while brainstorming was having an outside security auditor,\u201d he said. Coinbase had Adreas Antonopoulos, the chief security officer at competitor Blockchain, come in and audit their security systems (you can see what he had to say here). \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg of what we can do,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said.

Gox to file for bankruptcy in Japan on Friday could also lead the troubled bitcoin exchange to seek the protection of a U.S. court, bankruptcy experts say. U.S. bankruptcy law allows foreign companies that have sought protection of their home courts to protect themselves and their assets on U.S. soil through what\u2019s called a Chapter 15 bankruptcy case. Like other bankruptcy chapters, Chapter 15 offers the all-important automatic stay\u2014the shield that halts all pending litigation against a company and bars anyone from bringing new litigation. Mt. Gox, an exchange for buyers and sellers of the digital currency known as bitcoin, shut down earlier this week. The company lost almost 750,000 of its customers\u2019 bitcoins and around 100,000 of its own, together worth about $473 million at market prices. Mt. Gox lawyers said Friday that the company\u2019s debts totaled 6.5 billion yen ($63.6 million) versus assets of 3.84 billion yen. \u201cGiven the international scope of Mt. Gox and similar exchanges, one can assume that there will be creditors in the United States and they\u2019ll be seeking remedies against Mt. Gox,\u201d said Howard Seife, global chairman of Chadbourne & Parke LLP\u2019s restructuring practice. Thursday, one of Bitcoin\u2019s customers sued the company in a federal court in Chicago seeking to recover lost bitcoins as well as damages. The suit, which seeks class-action status, likely won\u2019t be the last that Mt. Gox faces, and a Chapter 15 filing would let the company hit the pause button on the litigation as well as prevent customers and creditors from bringing new suits. \u201cIt would make sense to file a [Chapter] 15 here to at least get a stay to have one organized place to deal with all this litigation because there\u2019s going to be more,\u201d said Evan Hollander, a bankruptcy partner with Arnold & Porter LLP. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code generally sets a low bar to establish jurisdiction for a bankruptcy filing\u2014a company must have property or place of business in the U.S., and such property can be as simple as a bank account. \u201cThe first question is whether Mt. Gox has assets in the United States that need to be protected,\u201d Mr. Seife said. \u201cBut even if they don\u2019t, they probably would not want to have to deal with litigation here and would want to channel all claims to the bankruptcy court in Tokyo.\u201d Mt. Gox could not be reached for comment. A message posted to its website Wednesday from Chief Executive Mark Karpeles asked that \u201cpeople refrain from asking questions to our staff: they have been instructed not to give any response or information.\u201d Mt. Gox isn\u2019t the first bitcoin company to turn to bankruptcy during the industry\u2019s brief history. In November, bitcoin miner Alydian filed for Chapter 11 protection after struggling to make money within the volatile industry using technology that\u2019s no longer state-of-the-art. Bitcoin miners, who check timestamps of bitcoin transactions to make sure people aren\u2019t using the coins more than once or are spending bitcoins they don\u2019t have, are rewarded with bitcoins that they come across in the process. Alydian then sold the bitcoins it mined. Alydian sought to use its bankruptcy to shed contracts with customers who had agreed to buy mined bitcoins at prices that eventually became too low as the value of the virtual currency skyrocketed. However, a judge dismissed its bankruptcy case this week after majority owner CoinLab Inc. resolved a dispute with a key Alydian customer. As for the timing of a possible Chapter 15 filing by Mt. Gox, Mr. Seife said there\u2019s \u201cno magic\u201d rule. Some companies will launch cross-border court proceedings concurrently; others will wait months to see if relief is needed. \u201cWho owns the assets, how significant they are, what litigation is pending, and really where the business activity is can drive whether there is more or less need for cross-border interaction,\u201d said Robert Eisenbach, a bankruptcy attorney with Cooley LLP. Whatever happens with Mt. Gox, Mr. Seife said \u201cgiven all the secrecy around bitcoins and who holds them,\u201d it will be interesting to watch as customers begin filing claims against the company for their missing bitcoins. \u201cWill holders of bitcoin want to make themselves known and appear? One of the major attributes of bitcoin has been its anonymity,\u201d he said. -Katy Stech contributed to this article.

Gox\u2019s missing bitcoins. Roughly 850,000 of its own and its customers\u2019 bitcoins have vanished, according to the now-collapsed exchange, which said Friday it would file for bankruptcy protection. Mt. Gox, once the dominant bitcoin trading venue, didn\u2019t explain how the bitcoins disappeared. The popular explanation seems to be a theft by malicious hackers. But one consequence of bitcoin\u2019s digital design is that the money trail is out in the open: Bitcoin\u2019s global ledger carries details of each transaction since the earliest days of the virtual currency. It\u2019s possible to go back in time and (painstakingly) trace the virtual addresses through which each bitcoin moved. Can the missing Mt. Gox money be found this way? Maybe. Part of the trick is identifying which bitcoin addresses belong to Mt. Gox. Two bitsleuths at letstalkbitcoin.com, Adam B. Levine and Napoleon Cole, have picked up the trail in 2011, when Mt. Gox chief executive Mark Karpeles apparently moved a large sum of bitcoins from one address to another in a public attempt to demonstrate that Mt. Gox had a lot. Another source of addresses is Mt. Gox customers themselves: People who deposit bitcoins with the exchange would know the address to which they sent coins; likewise, customers who were able to withdraw from Mt. Gox would be able to see where coins came from. Friday, bitcoiners were swapping addresses in forums like online comment shop Reddit. (Mt. Gox itself, of course, could make a full public disclosure of the addresses it used, but it so far it hasn\u2019t done so.) The trickiest part will be finding addresses that account for large sums at Mt. Gox. The exchange is believed to have used a so-called \u201chot wallet\u201d for day-to-day transactions, an account that\u2019s kept separate from a \u201ccold wallet\u201d used as a sort of savings account. The bulk of customer withdrawals \u201cmay be linked only to recent deposits by other clients (that is, going through a relatively small hot wallet),\u201d says Oleg Andreev, a Paris-based software developer and bitcoin enthusiast. But, he says, given enough data, sleuths might be able to reveal a Mt. Gox address holding a large number of bitcoins\u2014if, for instance, Mt. Gox had to dip into a cold wallet to make a transfer. Still, the crowdsourcing effort faces plenty of challenges. Given the legal and regulatory haze surrounding bitcoin, customers might be reluctant to divulge their addresses. And, notes Mr. Andreev, the customers most angry at Mt. Gox\u2014the ones who put cash in and never got bitcoins out\u2014wouldn\u2019t have any source addresses to link to. \u201cIf you deposited dollars to purchase some coins but never withdrew any, then you have no info to contribute,\u201d Mr. Andreev said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Neelabh Chaturvedi', 'email': 'Neelabh Chaturvedi'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/28/bitsleuths-start-hunt-for-mt-goxs-missing-bitcoin/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 28, 12, 41), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitsleuths Start Hunt for Mt.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$573.51, down 0.6% \xa0(via\xa0CoinDesk) - So who exactly is losing money from the Mt. Gox crisis?\xa0The collapse of Mt. Gox has been compared to a lot of things: An existential threat. Doom. A Lehman moment. There\u2019s one big difference, though, between the Panic of 2008 and the Bitcoin Crisis of 2014: that\u2019s the victims. The critical difference between what\u2019s happening now at Mt. Gox and what happened at Lehman Brothers is that when the latter went down, a lot of pensions went up in smoke, a lot of 401(k) retirement funds got crushed, a lot of mom-and-pop investors lost their savings. In other words, safe, conservative investors got badly burned. The Mt. Gox debacle isn\u2019t like that. For one thing, despite the perception that Mt. Gox disappeared overnight, it didn\u2019t. Yes, the website did literally go blank overnight (New York time, at least). But the company\u2019s problems have been persistent for years. Its reputation as an opaque, shadowy outfit has has been growing since at least last summer. Investors had plenty of warning about the problems at Mt. Gox. They either walked away, or rode the lightning.\xa0When Mt. Gox halted withdrawals last summer, we spoke with several investors who had their money tied up there. We reached out again this week. Two replied to us, and both said they\u2019d gotten their money last summer \u2013 and left Mt. Gox for good. They saw the handwriting on the wall, and walked the other way. Mt. Gox had a questionable track record, which was very well know in the Bitcoin community. The exchange\xa0suspended trading in April 2013, then suspended dollar withdrawals in June. In May, the firm was sued by CoinLab over a failed partnership that would\u2019ve seen the latter take over Mt. Gox\u2019s U.S. and Canadian business. Later in May, the Department of Homeland Security seized money from Gox\u2019s account with payment processor Dwolla. There have been other, lesser withdrawal delays as well. It\u2019s impossible to broadly characterize all of the exchange\u2019s customers, but it\u2019s a fair bet that many of them were savvy enough to be aware of those risks. In fact, it appears some traders were actively wagering on them. What\u2019s notable is that trading volume on Mt. Gox (before Monday night\u2019s shutdown, that is) had been rising as the price went down. On the one hand, that represents investors just looking to get out. But there were traders on the other side of those deals, betting that they\u2019d get bitcoin at a cheap price before the floor fell out. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say a large majority of them were aware of the risks,\u201d said Greg Schvey, co-founder of data site The Genesis Block. Put simply, that was not Mrs. Watanabe making those bets. (Paul Vigna) -\xa0West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin made himself the most hated man\xa0on the\xa0reddit pages dedicated to bitcoin\xa0on Wednesday when he suggested that bitcoin should be banned. On Thursday, he continued his crusade. The Democratic Senator, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, grilled Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen on the subject. Ms. Yellen tried to softshoe the question, but the Senator insisted, and pledged to continue his fusillade against the digital currency. Ms. Yellen said regulating bitcoin would not be easy, given its decentralized, international nature, and suggested the Fed isn\u2019t the right place for that, given that the banks it regulates are not involved in bitcoin. Mr. Manchin wasn\u2019t biting on that, and said he will continue working to ban it. The reddit boards were active with people trying to advance petitions to have Sen. Manchin removed from the banking committee, and imploring each other to flood his offce with phone calls, as well as the offices of the other legislators and regulators he\u2019s trying to corral. We put in a call to the Senator\u2019s office, to guage the reaction, but haven\u2019t heard back yet. The Bitcoin community in general, which you can imagine is feeling a bit of pressure this week, was also vocal in its response. Figures like Marc Andreessen and Erik Voorhees were pretty blistering on Twitter, the Bitcoin Foundation wrote a letter to the Senator, and Fred Wilson, the Union Square venture capitalist who\u2019s made bitcoin-related investments, wrote \xa0a letter back to the Senator as well. \u201cWhen something as new and as different as Bitcoin emerges, it is tempting to want to \u2018put the Genie back into the bottle\u2019 and protect ourselves from it. But thankfully the U.S. did not do that with the Internet,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe should approach Bitcoin in exactly the same way and if we do, I expect the benefits we will see will be equally important, impactful, and beneficial to our economy and our society.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - Amid all the noise surrounding the Mt. Gox debacle, the folks over at CoinDesk have provided the 30,000-foot view with the release of their first annual \u201cState of Bitcoin\u201d report. The report recaps the torrid growth in the digital currency and the significant challenges it still faces, as well as Bitcoin\u2019s growth among merchants and venture capitalists. Illustrating how fast the market is changing, the report shows, for example, how Mt. Gox dominated trading in first six months of 2013, but was toppled by BTC China in November, which was subsequently supplanted by Bitstamp in December. Rather than spend time recapping, we present below the report itself, which logs in at 91-pages, but it\u2019s done in a Power-Point style that\u2019s easily readable.

In a note to clients on Wednesday, Citigroup currency strategist Steven Englander said bitcoin has become \u201ceven more speculative\u201d following the Mt.

Its ability to speed transactions globally, its lack of costs and fees, its potential for acceptance in any economy makes it potentially the biggest leap in the money system since we dumped seashells for metal and paper. At the same time, bitcoin and its proponents are exceptionally na\xefve. A free and unfettered system for payments? Sounds fantastic. In reality, there\u2019s the obvious volatility which makes bitcoin completely useless for everyday transactions. At least Nigerian princes offer some sense of price stability. A TV on Overstock.com, one of the few retailers to accept bitcoin, cost 19 bitcoin a year ago, 0.49 bitcoin at bitcoin\u2019s December high and 1.02 bitcoin Wednesday. Either you get a crypto-good deal or pantsed by the Internet. That\u2019s something, but not a dependable currency. It could be an investment. If so, bitcoin is a highly speculative one, kind of like betting black 13 on the roulette wheel. How long, too, would it take for this system to be abused by criminals, con artists, terrorists and eventually Wall Street? There is evidence all but the latter has happened. But just give the big banks time, they\u2019ll figure it out. What bitcoin requires for the mass acceptance is exactly the opposite of what it\u2019s trying to be. It requires standards for its exchanges including adequate reserves and transparent mark-to-market reporting. It needs to find the balance of tracking of transactions without violating personal privacy. As the Internal Revenue Service agent wrote in the complaint against Bitinstant, the exchange shut down in January, bitcoins \u201care known to be used to facilitate illicit transactions and to launder criminal proceeds, given the ease with which the can be used to move money anonymously.\u201d Conversely, both Bitinstant and Silk Road were closed by regulators within months of the alleged laundering. So either this stuff is too easy to do, or too easy to catch. Either way, bitcoin needs better understanding and a better framework to be viable. In other words, bitcoin needs to become more like the U.S. dollar. It needs banks, regulated ones. And doesn\u2019t that take all of the fun out of it? New rules, implemented by bitcoiners themselves, are unlikely given the subversive nature of the currency and those who use it. Likewise, many lawmakers and regulators don\u2019t seem interested. They have either praised or been silent on bitcoin. Most likely, that\u2019s because they don\u2019t understand it. These are people, after all, raised on cash and checks and Green Stamps. And if you doubt it, check out your congressman\u2019s Twitter account. Even if lawmakers do get it, they\u2019re probably reluctant to step on anything that appears to have come out of Silicon Valley. Technology is about the only thing everyone agrees the U.S. is truly competitive in globally. Washington is at once terrified of technological change and confused on how not to mess up a good thing. Ultimately, bitcoin\u2019s biggest problem is that it lacks what the dollar \u2013 or the yen, euro or peso \u2013 has, and that is a level of trust and confidence of the users. It\u2019s the key ingredient to commerce. Currency is a contract. The safeguards around the dollar: money laundering laws, bank regulation, federal insurance of deposits \u2013 all of them buttress faith that a dollar is worth a dollar. Does it work? For all of the knocks against the dollar, including fears of hyperinflation, the dollar saw an inflation rate of 1.6% last year. That TV on Overstock.com cost pretty much the same a year ago as it does today. In the end, bitcoin as an \u201calternative\u201d currency is much like \u201calternative\u201d music. It works for people with a narrow set of tastes, some who simply just want to be different. Dollars, like top 40 radio, may have its limitations (I\u2019m looking at you, Drake), but it\u2019s what most of us can agree on. Bitcoin may indeed become the currency of the future. But today it\u2019s like an indie band that always seems to use the wrong chord (hello, Arctic Monkeys).

Gox\u2019s shutdown, the biggest setback in bitcoin\u2019s five-year history, the question for the virtual currency is: what\u2019s next? Many bitcoin advocates are hopeful that there are lessons to be learned from the Mt. Gox episode that ultimately will help the virtual currency mature and prosper. Others, however, argue that bitcoin faces reputational damage that could be irreparable following the exchange\u2019s shutdown. \u201cBitcoin becomes even more speculative,\u201d Citigroup currency strategist Steven Englander said Wednesday in a note to clients. \u201cThis is the latest and biggest in a series of losses to Bitcoin holders that can be viewed as related to fraud or poor security. Moreover, the risk seems to have been known for years without the Bitcoin developers instituting a complete fix,\u201d he said. \u201cSo one question is whether the decentralized structure, which is the attraction to many, makes it too cumbersome to enact essential fixes.\u201d While trading at Mt. Gox has ground to a halt, Bitcoin prices rose 8% to $577.52 on Wednesday, according to the CoinDesk price index that tracks \xa0two other virtual-currency exchanges. But the rebound came after bitcoin briefly plunged more than 23% on Tuesday after the Mt. Gox news was unveiled. One bitcoin fetched $700 at the start of the year and was valued at more than $1,100 in early December. Another issue, Mr. Englander says, is that fraud wasn\u2019t a big concern for bitcoin users. But thanks to the Mt. Gox debacle, the prospect of fake transactions is looming large. \u201cEarlier security questions had centered around everything except the possibility that there might be a fraudulent transactions record,\u201d he said. \u201cThe imperviousness to fraud was one the big attractions of Bitcoin and the surprise exploitation of a known defect is a setback. Now it looks like just another payments system that has to worry about fraud.\u201d Mr. Englander outlined three risks facing Bitcoin right now: 1) Bitcoin traders and potential investors lose confidence in the security and safety of Bitcoin transactions and holdings. 2) Other digital currencies start eating into Bitcoin\u2019s market share, taking away some of the first-mover advantage. 3) \u201cCompetition emerges from conventional financial institutions using generic bitcoin technology, without the decentralization and within the conventional regulatory framework,\u201d Mr. Englander says. The bottom line: \u201cBitcoin\u2019s market cap on paper by far exceeds that of the competition, but the ability to translate Bitcoin wealth to wealth in other forms is very limited,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are many Bitcoin holders heavily invested in Bitcoin\u2019s success and it has a first mover advantage.

Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$512.24, down 6.1% \xa0(via\xa0CoinDesk) - As Mt. Gox was slipping into the abyss last night, with questions about whether it steps back, a document \u2014 titled \u201cCrisis Strategy Draft\u201d \u2014 started making the rounds that purported to show a plan to shut the site down, rescue it via a coordinated effort from peers, and rebuild and rebrand the site. It also reported that there\u2019d been a theft of 744,000 BTC \u2013 an amount that rendered the firm insolvent. This document was obtained and released by Ryan Selkis, who writes a daily newsletter under the pen name Two-Bit Idiot. He\u2019s been called far worse than that in the last 18 some-odd hours. As the document spread across Twitter, he was called irresponsible, accused of fear mongering, and assaulted with language that can\u2019t be printed in a family blog. That said, he stands by the document, his decision to release it and, somewhat controversially perhaps, his decision to sell all his bitcoin holdings ahead of it. \u201cThis is not how I wanted to make a name for myself within the industry,\u201d he wrote in Tuesday\u2019s edition of his daily newsletter. \u201cWhen the \u2018Crisis Strategy Draft\u2019 hit my inbox yesterday, I was confronted with an ethical dilemma.\u201d He could have sat on it, he said, \u201cbut I truly believed that the document looked and felt authentic, and there were mere hours before Mt. Gox was to go dark.\u201d He disclosed that he sold all his bitcoin holdings, and took a lot of grief for it. He noted, though, that he\u2019d imposed a 30-day moratorium on himself from buying again, and added that he had \u201climited financial incentive\u201d to publish the document. \u201cIn addition to my personal investment, I also work on two separate bitcoin-related projects full time, both of which are in potential jeopardy due to this news. \xa0Not only from a VC funding standpoint, but from an operating standpoint.\u201d \u201cI am sure there are people who will accuse me of price manipulation and all sorts of nefarious actions, but the truth is, my conscience is clean and I have nothing to hide in the event of subpoenas,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am not so sure about others within the industry.\u201d There might be a bigger problem for bitcoin, though, than Mt. Gox, he said. \u201cThis scandal has changed the game for Bitcoin.\u201d In the wake of this, regulators are likely to get more draconian with an industry now know primarily among the public for the black-market site Silk Road, and the collapse of one of its biggest exchanges. \xa0It\u2019s \u201cnaive,\u201d he said, to think legislators and regulators will rush to bitcoin\u2019s defense.\xa0(Paul Vigna) - It is generally assumed that the bitcoin market is so small that nothing that happens there has an effect on the wider world. Witness the travails of Mt. Gox, of which nobody in the capital markets is very worried about. What if that\u2019s not exactly the case, though? An intriguing note crossed our desk from Andrew Zatlin, who runs a one-man research shop out of California called SouthBay Research. We might not otherwise by inclined to take it seriously, but Mr. Zatlin was a canny record of mining unusual sources of data and information and producing unusually accurate reports. In this case, Mr. Zatlin suggests, and this is just a theory, mind you, that China\u2019s decision to ban bitcoin not only drove down prices of bitcoin, but cut off Chinese investors from using it as a conduit to get money out of China and into productive assets elsewhere \u2014 like U.S. real estate. \u201cFor the past few years, U.S. and U.K. home sales have been boosted by overseas (i.e. Russian and Chinese) buyers,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients, in what amounted to a safe-haven investments. \u201cBitcoins served to move the money undetected. Like diamonds, bitcoins are bought and then converted back into local currency.\u201d China, and then Russia, both moved to restrict its citizens\u2019 access to bitcoin. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how much of the U.S. housing market depends on \xa0Chinese investors, much less how much is enabled by bitcoin. But obviously a significant amount if shutting off the bitcoin flow had such an immediate hit.\u201d The \u201cbig objective\u201d for the Chinese is to restrict capital outflows, and those outflows have been fueling the U.S. housing market, he said. \u201cAs China\u2019s liquidity problems escalate and the PBOC works to block capital flight, expect slower home and commercial sales.\u201d It remains a theory, though it\u2019s very interesting to think that bitcoin, in some measure, may already be having real-world effects. (Paul Vigna) - One thing that makes Mt. Gox\u2019s collapse more like MF Global than Lehman Brothers is the lack of a derivatives market, where risk can be spread liberally among counterparties. But there is a, small, nascent derivatives market, and it is suffering from Mt. Gox\u2019s travails. The beta-mode derivatives trading site BTC.SX has suspended services \u201cuntil further notice,\u201d according to a report from CoinDesk. The site cited the closure of its main exchange partner as the reason for the shutdown; the exchange in question, it confirmed to CoinDesk, was Mt. Gox. The site didn\u2019t receive any advance word that Mt. Gox would shut down, CEO Joseph Lee told CoinDesk, and was searching now for new exchanges with which to conduct business.

Gox highlight a risk for investors: where, in the virtual-currency world, are the boundaries between broker, exchange and clearing house? Details of Mt. Gox\u2019s current financial troubles, and its inner workings, are still sketchy, but it appears the company has variously operated as all three: it took customers\u2019 deposits, held their bitcoins, executed trades and exchanged bitcoins for cash. According to one account, Mt. Gox appears to have lost\u2014or lost track of\u2014some of the bitcoins customers kept with it. Mt. Gox\u2019s website was all-but shut Tuesday. None of the core trading or account-management functions were operating, and all that was left was a message saying transactions were halted. It wasn\u2019t clear what, if anything, Mt. Gox has done with its customers\u2019 bitcoin. But the move to freeze transactions underscores a risk bitcoin investors must take\u2014at least if they want to swap bitcoins for cash or trade in a large marketplace: Some entity has to be trusted to hold the coins. \u201cThe Mt. Gox case is the Lehman Brothers moment for digital currencies. This is a wake-up call for everyone and there will be major ramifications,\u201d said Mark T. Williams, who teaches finance at Boston University and has studied bitcoin sceptically. \u201cThese exchanges are holding client funds but behaving more like boiler-room brokers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole bitcoin exchange infrastructure has been built on clay feet.\u201d To be sure, Mt. Gox\u2019s customers could have avoided seeing their funds frozen had they transferred their bitcoin out of Mt. Gox and onto an external wallet after completing transactions, said Oleg Andreev, a bitcoin enthusiast and software developer based in Paris. But even that\u2019s no guarantee\u2014earlier this month, Mt. Gox suddenly froze all withdrawals of coins. In the non-virtual world, clearinghouses generally stand in the middle of transactions on exchanges, to mitigate the risk that one party doesn\u2019t deliver. And regulators typically require a strict wall between client accounts and a brokerage\u2019s own money. Breaching the wall is messy: Brokerage firm MF Global Inc. dipped into customers\u2019 accounts in a failed attempt to avert bankruptcy. Further transparency on what an exchange does with client money can help ease panic, especially in the absence of a centralized clearing agency that would guarantee a trade if one of the entities goes under.

Amid the recent troubles, Mr. Wilson still remains confident in bitcoin\u2019s future. \u201cThe wonderful thing about a globally distributed financial network is that if one of the nodes goes down, it doesn\u2019t take the system down,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s architecture is similar to the Internet\u2019s architecture.

Almost every technology that I\u2019ve watched come into a mass adoption has gone through these sorts of growing pains.

Gox has disappeared. The website of the once-dominant bitcoin exchange went down earlier Tuesday. So did the prices of the digital currency. Earlier Tuesday, the chief executives of six major bitcoin exchanges and businesses pledged to coordinate efforts to assure customers of the security of their funds in response to mounting concern about the future of Mt. Gox. The statements failed to temper frayed investor nerves. The price of bitcoin has fallen below $500 according to the price index of CoinDesk, a London-based news provider which does not currently include Mt. Gox prices in its calculations. Prices had topped $1,000 as recently as December. On Mt. Gox, the price had fallen as low as $131.71 before the exchange went down, according to CoinDesk. Mt. Gox had been clocking decent volumes before its website disappeared, suggesting some investors were still betting on profiting from buying bitcoin cheaply on Mt. Gox and selling them on elsewhere at a higher price. One blog suggested that Mt. Gox had lost nearly 750,000 bitcoin as a result of theft over several years.  Though hard to quantify because of price fluctuations in bitcoin, that would represent a loss of around $365 million at Monday\u2019s trading prices on other exchanges. At Mt.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $543.00 (via Coindesk) Update from the engine room. Bitcoin\u2019s five-man core development team is now testing an updated 0.9 version of the digital currency\u2019s open-source core software, complete with fixes to the annoying bug that facilitated this month\u2019s crippling hacker attack the bitcoin network. Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen said he hopes that by the end of this week, the team can send out this \u201csecond candidate\u201d for the 0.9 version to select sophisticated users, who will install it and put it through its paces. (The flawed first candidate was sent to the same savvy members of the bitcoin community \u201cjust before this kerfuffle happened,\u201d as Mr. Andresen described the attack, which overwhelmed and forced numerous exchanges and mining pools to freeze external bitcoin transfers.) If all goes to plan and the updated software works smoothly in the real world, the Foundation will formally roll out Bitcoin 0.9 for the wider community sometime within the next two to three weeks, he said. For most individuals and merchants dealing in bitcoin, these changes won\u2019t be noticeable. \xa0Most exchanges and bitcoin services have been back up and running for the past week \u2013 with the notable exception of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox (see below) \u2013thanks to some workaround patches designed by a member of Mr. Andresen\u2019s team,\xa0Jeff Garzik of payment processor Bipay. But until there\u2019s a permanent fix to the bugs in the underlying software, firms won\u2019t be able to run their digital wallets as efficiently and the prospect of attacks will persist. The coding changes are concentrated in the so-called \u201cBitcoin-QT\u201d software piece that many institutions use for managing digital wallets, rather than in the core \u201cBitcoind\u201d code, which allows users to interact with the digital currency\u2019s central ledger of transactions, known as the blockchain. For now, Mr. Andresen said, no changes have been made to a quirk in the Bitcoind code known as \u201ctransaction malleability,\u201d which allows users to change transactions\u2019 ID codes and which the hacker exploited to mutate thousands of transactions and so overwhelmed exchanges\u2019 accounts. That\u2019s because in rare cases where multiple approvals are needed for a batch of linked transactions, IDs need to be altered. Rather, the development team\u2019s fixes are focused on preventing rogue operators from exploiting that feature for nefarious ends. Still, Mr. Andresen said there is consensus on the development team for future versions to incorporate a change that \u201centirely clamps down on transaction malleability so that you can create transactions that are not malleable at all,\u201d while making such a feature optional in cases where it is needed. Getting version 0.9\u2019s second candidate out into real-world testing will allow some well-earned rest for the small group of core developers, only three of whom work full time. In the wake of the attack, they were inundated with calls from exchanges and other members of the bitcoin community. Things calmed down after exchanges such as Slovenia-based Bitstamp got back up and running a week ago, but it has been a heavy slog since early February, when Mt. Gox\u2019s halt on withdrawals triggered the chaos. Asked if he was confident that they can push this out to the community at the end of this week, Mr. Andresen said, \u201cI hope so because I\u2019m going to Barbados on Sunday.\u201d (Michael Casey) Mt. Gox\u2019s problems only seem to be getting worse. The latest blow to its reputation: The Tokyo-based exchange\u2019s CEO, Mark Karpeles, has resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation after an online petition for the firm to exit the trade body garnered 1,740 signatures. The story was broken late Sunday by our Robin Sidel. Despite announcing a week ago that it was testing a fix that would allow it to restart withdrawals from its accounts, Mt. Gox\u2019s clients\u2019 funds are still frozen inside the exchange \u2013 even after rivals Bitstamp and BTC-e restored full operations after this month\u2019s hacking attack on the bitcoin network. Protestors have descended on Tokyo to demand their money back, but Mt. Gox and its holding company, Tibanne Co., continue to be very difficult to reach. As our Tokyo bureau reports, the fact Japanese authorities have declined to step in and mediate is complicating matters. No one knows who to turn to. The most telling sign of trouble is that the price for bitcoin on Mt. Gox now stands at $163.38, barely a third of that quoted by Coindesk\u2019s index, which is based on prices from Slovenia-based BitStamp and Bulgaria-based BTC-e. That discount can only mean one thing: investors are highly doubtful they\u2019ll get back 100 cents on the dollar \u2013 or, if you will, 100 million satoshis on the bitcoin. It has been an ignominious fall from grace for Mt. Gox, which started as an exchange for trading Magic trading cards and transformed itself into the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange and a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation. (Michael Casey) Sadly, we have a trifecta of bad bitcoin news today. Hey, we just report news. We don\u2019t make it. The third items comes from online security firm Trustwave, which said on its blog that a gang of cybercriminals used a virus known as \u201cPony\u201d to infiltrate 700,000 online accounts and steal virtual currencies worth approximately $220,000 in four-month period to mid-January. It\u2019s not a lot of money \u2013 not compared to, say, the $200 million attack on Target late last year \u2013 and the attacks seem to have subsided a month ago. But with so many accounts compromised and a range of coins stolen \u2013 bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin, and 27 others, according to Trustwave \u2013 the case highlights the other big security issue affecting digital currencies: wallet hacking. Mr. Andresen, the Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist, said he had no firsthand knowledge of the Pony virus attack but added that \u201cit\u2019s not surprising.\u201d HE said wallet security is an \u201cunsolved problem\u201d that\u2019s being worked on. \u201cThere are lots of things going on in the bitcoin world that will make things better in terms of security,\u201d Mr. Andresen added, \u201cbut there\u2019s definitely an issue of \u2018how do you make your bitcoin safe?\u201d (Michael Casey) Contacts: \xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$563.63, up 2.1% \xa0(via\xa0CoinDesk) - The first meeting of the marijuana and Bitcoin industries did not go so well.\xa0The pot industry has a problem: it\u2019s legal for medicinal purposes in 23 states, and for recreational use in two, Colorado and Washington. But it is illegal on a federal level, and while ostensibly that shouldn\u2019t be a problem, it\u2019s created a regulatory gap that scares off some banks, leaving legal pot sellers and retailers in a tight spot. They\u2019ve been forced to jury-rig banking relationships other merchants take for granted, either hiding the nature of their business or hoping local bankers turn a blind eye. Some are left to do a 100% cash business. That is a problem on several levels. It\u2019s hard to lug duffle bags full of cash to the taxman\u2019s office, for one thing. It\u2019s also rather dangerous. What they need is a safe, secure way to handle money. You see where this is going, don\u2019t you? In some respects, bitcoin seemed like the perfect answer: two industries on the edges of mainstream society that could help, and maybe even reinforce, each other. But it hasn\u2019t worked out that way, not so far at least, and the two industries in fact remain wary of each other. Sean Green runs Pacific Northwest Medical, with three medical marijuana dispensaries in Washington state, and when he first heard of bitcoin this year, he thought it could be at least a partial solution to his problems. Mr. Green had gone through four bank accounts in 2013, and was dumped by his credit-card company. That last took away a third of his business overnight. Hoping to get back a big chunk of his business, he began accepting bitcoin for purchases in February. But he quickly ran into the same problem that he had with the banks and credit-card companies: Coinbase, where he had set up his wallet, shut his account down when it discovered the nature of his business. When we caught up with him, though, Mr. Green wasn\u2019t worried about bitcoin. He was more excited about the notice from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who said banks should have the same legal cover to do business with the marijuana industry as the industry itself (the federal government has pledged not to prosecute pot businesses doing legal business under state laws). \u201cOur hypthetical stock value just quadrupled with that announcement,\u201d Mr. Green said. As for the Bitcoin experiment, he was philosophical about it. \u201cI accomplished my goal,\u201d he told us, \u201cwhich was proofing a new system. And it didn\u2019t work.\u201d But the Holder memo may not be the last word for banks and pot. The Colorado Bankers Association, for one, rejected the new guidelines. \u201cAt best, this amounts to \u2018serve these customers at your own risk\u2019 and it emphasizes all of the risks. This light is red,\u201d the group said in a statement. Given that caution, it isn\u2019t likely banks are going to rush through the pot dispensary doors. But that may not automatically lead to a second go-round for pot and bitcoin. In Colorado, the local pot industry looked into the digital currency, and rejected it as an alternative. \u201cMuch as we need a solution,\u201d said Mike Elliott, the executive director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very suitable to us.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - For Bitcoin, one of the most important things to keep an eye on, besides the plunging price at Mt. Gox, is the amount of investor capital coming in. Bitcoin\u2019s an ingenious system, but the real exciting stuff is going to come when \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u2033 gets going, when entrepreneurs start building products and services on top of the \u201crails.\u201d So, it was interesting to see a bitcoin-related fund climb into the top-1o over at AngelList, an online crowdfunding site for accredited investors. A \u201csyndicate\u201d started last month by Brock Pierce and focused on Bitcoin investments has attracted $500,000 in investments, from 23 investors, putting it eighth on the site\u2019s list of the top funds. The top syndicate is led by Kevin Rose, the founder of Digg. That fund has 711 backers and $3.7 million pledged. Other popular syndicates are led by Tim Ferriss, and Jason Calacanis. Mr. Pierce, a former child actor (\u201cMighty Ducks\u201d) and adult entrepreneur, plans to invest in 12 Bitcoin-related start-ups this year, with the average investment around $50,000. (Paul Vigna) - Amid all the sturm und drang surrounding Bitcoin these days, more than a few folks we\u2019ve seen have harped upon the existential nature of the moment. Will transaction malleability ruin the digital currency? Will the problems at Mt. Gox? The reality, though, is that the factors that will make or break Bitcoin are largely beyond the control of the techies running the system or the politicians eyeballing it, Jason Wisniewski writes in a thoughtful essay over at JDSupra. \u201cAll real money arises out of market transactions in a process that is unplanned and decentralized. In essence, a commodity that does not function as money initially but has value for its own sake (e.g. gold and silver),\xa0becomes valuable over a long period of time for another purpose, namely to facilitate exchange between parties. As more transactions are denominated in that particular commodity (or \u2018money\u2019), the value of that commodity as a medium of exchange continues to increase, which then becomes its primary value.\u201d Bitcoin isn\u2019t there yet, he said. But whether or not it gets there will be up to the people using it. \u201cReal money cannot be \u2018invented,\u2019 not by the smartest programmers in the world or \u2018wise\u2019 politicians, but must naturally arise from the voluntary actions and exchanges of market participants.\u201d (Paul Vigna) Contacts:\xa0paul.vigna@wsj.com,\xa0@paulvigna\xa0/\xa0michael.casey@wsj.com,\xa0@mikejcasey', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/21/bitbeat-bitcoin-and-pot-have-a-bad-trip/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 21, 16, 54), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'BitBeat: Bitcoin and Pot Have a Bad Trip'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, your daily dose of crypto current events, written by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$568.59\xa0 (via\xa0CoinDesk) - Well Mt. Gox really showed that guy. Our colleagues in Japan wrote earlier about the lone protester outside Mt. Gox\u2019s office in Tokyo, a man who\u2019s flown on his own from London just to confront company officials. He stood outside the door, in the snow no less, until he corralled CEO Mark Karpeles. Mt. Gox still hasn\u2019t resumed withdrawals, while the two other big exchanges have, but that wasn\u2019t the thing that most stood out to us in this morning\u2019s update from the company. Rather, it was the news that they\u2019ve moved their office. \u201d\xa0In addition to the technical issue, this week we have experienced some security problems, and as a result we had to relocate MtGox to our previous office building in Shibuya,\u201d the company wrote on its website. While they didn\u2019t elaborate on the \u201csecurity problems,\u201d we imagine it was the small group of protesters who have been camped out in front of the building for a week now. At the least, they did provide the new address. Although, as the team over at CoinDesk pointed out, it\u2019s not clear they\u2019re even there. In the meantime, the company still hasn\u2019t resumed customer withdrawals. On Monday, the company said it was implementing a solution, and promised an update on Thursday. That update, though, only explained that the move was delaying their progress. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox keeps dropping, which as we explained earlier can be seen as a bet on Mt. Gox\u2019s future. On Thursday, the price fell as low as $111.02, less than a fifth of the price on the other exchanges, and it appears to be dragging down prices on the other major exchanges (see below). Mt. Gox may not be the number-one exchange anymore, but they\u2019re still a big player. The market price is saying failure. That won\u2019t be a good thing. - Does the world really need a Winkdex? Did you mean: Windex?\xa0That was the result when we Googled \u201cWinkdex,\u201d the name of the new bitcoin pricing index unveiled yesterday by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The index will be used in conjunction with their Winklevoss Investment Trust as a benchmark to set the price of shares in the trust. Beyond its awkward name, there are real issues here for investors to consider. If it seems a bit unusual for an investment trust to benchmark its assets against its own index, well, it is, although it\u2019s not unprecedented. Investment trusts and funds typically use outside pricing and benchmarks to mark the value of the funds\u2019 shares. For an equities-based exchange traded fund, for example, that\u2019s the underlying shares, and there is no questioning the value of a particular equity holding. The prices are widely quoted on trusted exchanges for everyone to see. As you go down the line in terms of illiquidity, valuations become trickier. The key for the Winklevoss twins will be transparency. The index\u2019s formula is\xa0explained here, and seems relatively straightforward, but will investors feel comfortable buying shares in a fund that sets the price of those shares itself? For any market, the reliability of the pricing is paramount, and that is usually handled by trusted third-party (a dirty word in bitcoin circles, but still). Even then, real-world markets like Libor and the options market have fallen prey to rate-rigging scandals. Will investors feel comfortable with the Winklevoss\u2019s determining prices? While there is considerable volatility in bitcoin prices, that\u2019s as much a function of illiquidity as anything else. Also, there are other indexes available for pricing. Bitstamp and BTC-e report their own prices, obviously.\xa0CoinDesk has an index (which we use as our benchmark, for what it\u2019s worth). There\u2019s the unaffiliated open-source site bitcoinaverage.com, as well. Is there really is a need for a Winkdex? As of early this afternoon, here were the prices on the various indexes: CoinDesk: $568.59 Bitcoinaverage: $595.50 Coinbase: $577.40 Bitstamp: $575.24 BTC-e: $563.51 Winkdex: $576.55 Mt. Gox (just for fun): $117.00 Given time differences and \u201creal-time\u201d data, those numbers are pretty closely aligned, and the volatility in prices is as much a function of illiquidity as anything else. Now, in the real world, the dollar, for example, trades on different exchanges, all over the world, and at times the price quotes will be different on the various platforms. The difference is that the volume of trading is so high, and the systems so interconnected, that those differences are fleeting. They are so small it\u2019s possible to come up with one, world-wide, accepted price. That price is \u201cfixed\u201d every day in London, which sets the price for the day. In time, one of these exchanges might emerge as the dominant one, and the \u201cfix\u201d may be assigned to one spot. The Winklevoss\u2019s certainly hope that\u2019s them. The competition for that plum will be fierce. But over at CoinDesk, they aren\u2019t worried about competition. Far from it, in fact. \u201cWhether or not you\u2019re a fan of the Winklevoss twins,\u201d product manager Jeremy Bonney said to MoneyBeat in an email, \u201cit\u2019s great to have high-profile people investing in Bitcoin companies, developing ETFs, and developing ways of measuring the price of bitcoin. The more all of this gets talked about and developed, the stronger the overall Bitcoin ecosystem becomes.\u201d In the bitcoin world, getting rid of the \u201ctrusted third-party\u201d is the whole point. But in the investment trust world, you can exist without them. The Winklevii will have to become that trusted third-party if this thing\u2019s going to take off. - Benjamin Lawsky has emerged as a big deal in the digital currency space. He isn\u2019t a venture capitalist, or a miner. He doesn\u2019t even have a bitcoin wallet. But Mr. Lawsky is the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, and as such, is in a position to set the first real-world regulations for digital currencies.

While he didn\u2019t say anything particularly newsworthy, just the fact that he was willing to engage with the general public in such a setting is notable. \u201cMy hope is that if we can get appropriate guardrails in place to prevent money laundering, we can take a deep breath and really focus on trying to ensure that virtual currency firms flourish and continue to develop and innovate,\u201d he said in response to a question. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about what the future could hold for this very powerful technology.\u201d \u201cMost of all, we want to hear from as many varied voices as possible \u2014 one of the reasons we\u2019re hear today,\u201d he said elsewhere, and while it would be easy to be cynical about a statement like that, he really has appeared to go out of his way to learn as much about digital currencies as he can. He also burnished his street cred with the geek set. \u201cFirst, let me compliment your screen name,\u201d he said in response to a participant using the moniker fearistehmindkiller (sic). \u201cProbably my favorite line from Dune.\u201d You can read the whole thing here. - Watching developments in the world of digital currencies may feel like an episode of the HBO series \u201cDeadwood,\u201d but it won\u2019t for much longer. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s days of existing beyond the reach of government regulators are numbered (and thankfully so),\u201d Jason Tyra writes in Bitcoin Magazine. Just like the boom town of Deadwood, S.D., eventually fell under the aegis of the United States, so will the world of bitcon, he says, and that\u2019s a good thing.

Gox have floundered ever since the once-dominant exchange for the digital currency halted withdrawals earlier this month.

The Tokyo-based exchange said earlier this week that withdrawals will resume \u201csoon\u201d and promised more details by Thursday. In reality, a statement on Thursday contained scant new information and the timeline for anyone looking to cash in their bitcoins still looks very hazy. The result of Mt.

The extent of the gap between prices on Mt. Gox and other exchanges has widened dramatically, reflecting concerns about Mt. Gox\u2019s future. But it\u2019s not uncommon that different exchanges show different prices for bitcoin. As there is no global central clearing agency for bitcoin, users can typically move to any exchange they want.

Both Lamassu and a competitor, Robocoin, have gotten their first bitcoin ATMs up and running. Lamassu installed its first ATM at a cigar bar in Albuquerque,\xa0near the University of New Mexico, on Tuesday. Others will be coming. We\u2019re still waiting for the first one to hit Manhattan. Meanwhile, Robocoin claims they have the first \u201creal\u201d ATM, which they will be unveiling at the HandleBar tavern in Austin, Texas (in time for South by Southwest) on Thursday. But Robocoin claims it\u2019s got the first \u201creal\u201d bitcoin ATM, since its machine allows the user to both take out and sell bitcoin, whereas Lamassu\u2019s machine allows for only a dollars-to-bitcoin transaction. Either way, bitcoin ATMs are finally in the U.S. (Lamassu has sold nearly 200 of the machines so far, but all overseas). This should make it easier for consumers to acquire bitcoin (assuming they\u2019ve already taken the step of getting a wallet first), and seeing as the U.S. consumer is the holy grail of everything economy-related, this ATM business could be a big business. Lamassu and Robocoin aren\u2019t the only ones in the space, either. A Canadian start-up, BiT Capital, got a $10 million commitment for funding earlier this month. - Got a question for Benjamin Lawsky?

Mr. Daley isn\u2019t exactly a bitcoin denier \u2014 he started mining for bitcoin himself in 2011 \u2013 but he has his doubts about its future, and he has an interesting background: he has been a technology consultant for Microsoft, Facebook, and MySpace, and is now an investment strategist, so he sees both the technology and financial implications of crypto-currencies. The central notion behind bitcoin \u2014 that two parties can exchange digital money over a network without a \u201ctrusted\u201d third party intermediary \u2014 solves a \u201chuge\u201d problem, he said. But it\u2019s still in its infancy, and has a whole host of unanswered questions swirling around it. To his thinking, bitcoin not only is not a fully formed system, it\u2019s not even in a beta stage. \u201cBitcoin is at best an alpha technology,\u201d he said. To his thinking, all the media attention has actually been a detriment to bitcoin\u2019s development. Ah, we didn\u2019t quite know what to say to that. \u201cIf bitcoin had more time to mature,\u201d he said, even a few years, it might produce a better system. But now it\u2019s got a ton of attention, all its flaws are being widely exposed, and possible competitors in the \u201cold\u201d payments world can just sit back and watch, and learn. \u201cIf I\u2019m Heartlands [Payments Systems], Visa, I\u2019m learning everything I can about this,\u201d he said. Which is more or less where he sees the technology going. Several years from now, he expects the underlying technology behind bitcoin will be absorbed by companies like Visa, with bitcoin relegated to the same historical bin as the Betamax. \u201cIf the concept survives,\u201d he said, the average user will use it through those third parties, and won\u2019t even know it. After all, he said, it\u2019s not a given that people even want to cut out the middle man, and this is coming from someone who counts himself as a libertarian. But even more than that, he doubts sovereign nations will just up and let bitcoin or any crypto-currency usurp their greatest strength: not only their control over currencies, but the ability to delineate who gets to be the intermediaries. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s the guy with gun who has all the power.\u201d - Nicolas Cary, the 28-year old CEO of Blockchain, always had it in the back of his mind that he\u2019d donate money to his alma mater, the University of Puget Sound, when he got the chance. This month, he got the chance, and he made a donation. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, he made it in bitcoin. Mr. Cary donated $10,000 worth of bitcoin (14.5 BTC) \xa0to the Tacoma, Wash., school, which may well be the first donation of its kind to an educational institution. Mr. Cary said he got the idea for the bitcoin donation over the holidays, and when he first approached the liberal arts college, \u201cit totally grounded them, it caught them from left field.\u201d But after he explained the mechanics of it, and helped them set up an account with BitPay, he said they got very excited. \u201cThey spend all their time doing mailers and old-style fund-raising.\u201d This could open up a new avenue for fund-raising, he surmised. \u201cI think it\u2019s really exciting for UPS (that\u2019s the school, not the package-delivery service) to lead the way with this,\u201d as opposed to a tech school like MIT, said Mr. Cary, who graduated in 2007 with a bachelor\u2019s degree\u2019 he was a double major, in business leadership and international political economy. We can confirm the school was excited. A representative from the school called us on Tuesday to tell us about it, and you could hear the excitement in her voice. It\u2019s not the first time bitcoin has met higher education, though. This past fall, the University of Nicosia in Cyprus began accepting bitcoin for all school business, from tuition to boarding to books. - There\u2019s a bizarre, new, shadowy currency system being introduced that may revolutionize society, or destroy it.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$617.11 \xa0(via\xa0CoinDesk) - When Mt. Gox first brought up the issue of \u201ctransaction malleability,\u201d the cause of its latest strife, the general response was that it was trying to shift the blame. Then the software glitch became a Trojan Horse for hackers, and all the other major exchanges were subjected to the same undermining attacks. We can imagine the exchange\u2019s team having a chuckle at that. They scored a victory, of sorts. But it\u2019s been of the Pyrrhic variety. In an update to customers on Monday, the bitcoin exchange said it\u2019s got a workaround in place, and\xa0it expects to resume withdrawals \u201csoon.\u201d That\u2019s not likely to mollify already agitated customers, especially when rival exchange Bitstamp has already fixed its problem and resumed service on Saturday. Mt. Gox\u2019s customers have\xa0existential questions about the exchange, as detailed by our colleagues Takashi Mochizuki and Eleanor Warnock in Toyko. This isn\u2019t exactly a new issue for Mt. Gox, which was in a similar place last summer when it was forced to halt withdrawals for a time. These shutdowns aren\u2019t aided by the fact that the company is notoriously tight-lipped (it still hasn\u2019t replied to BitBeat\u2019s request for comment). The combination engenders distrust, something that isn\u2019t good for any exchange, whether it\u2019s dealing in stocks, cows, or bitcoin. Bitcoin price quotes on Mt. Gox\u2019s site have been running far, far lower than on other exchanges. Recently, they were quoted at $248.25, and over the weekend we saw them as low as $220. On CoinDesk, the price quote is more than twice that. That difference is, essentially, a bet on Mt. Gox\u2019s future, and it\u2019s not a bet that\u2019s running in its favor, according to Ledra Capital\u2019s managing director, Antonis Polemitis, who wrote about it on Twitter over the weekend: Journalists: Mt Gox price currently only real-time market on probability Mt Gox is solvent. Currently more than 2:1 against. \u2014 Antonis Polemitis (@polemitis) February 17, 2014 Mr. Polemitis stressed to BitBeat that he didn\u2019t know whether or not Mt. Gox was solvent. The point, he said, was that currently (until it changes) customers can\u2019t get their money out of the exchange, and the difference between the price on Mt. Gox and other exchanges represents a bet. \u201cThe price reflects the market price, times some probability you\u2019ll ever be able to take [bitcoin] out,\u201d Mr. Polemitis said. Roughly speaking, if people are willing to take $300 (or less) for bitcoin on Mt. Gox, they\u2019re pricing in a 50% chance they\u2019ll never get that money. \u201cIt might be panic, it might not be well-thought out, but it\u2019s a market,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the exchange suffered another blow to its reputation when ZeroBlock, a popular bitcoin pricing app, dropped Mt. Gox pricing without warning over the weekend. \u201cWe dropped Mt. Gox because the price on Mt. Gox did not reflect an open market rate,\u201d Dan Held, the app\u2019s creator, told us via email. \u201cThey will have a difficult time replacing\xa0funds and faith lost over the last few weeks. We are exchange agnostic. However,\xa0when the exchange ceases to be an exchange, then they are removed from the price feed. If their operations normalize we will return their pricing data.\u201d Lastly, there\u2019s a petition circulating around, asking the Bitcoin Foundation to dump Mark Karpeles, the CEO of Mt. Gox\u2019s parent company, Tibanne, from the foundation\u2019s board. It currently has about 500 signatures. Once upon a time, a year or so ago, Mt. Gox was the king of the bitcoin-exchange hill. It\u2019s lost that position, and it\u2019s steadily been breaking faith with its customers. It\u2019s hard to know if it can restore that faith. (Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin has been steadily if slowly attracting more attention on Wall Street. Analysts at Citi and J.P. Morgan have penned research notes, and we got one today from Wedbush, a securities firm based in California that traces its roots back to 1955. But what was almost as interesting as the note itself was this: Wedbush is\xa0selling the note on its website, and accepting payment\xa0via bitcoin. \u201cWe are now open for business with virtual currency,\u201d the firm wrote on its site. The arrangement is unusual in at least two respects: First is the bitcoin angle, of course, but also, we can\u2019t recall ever seeing another firm selling its research directly online (it\u2019s selling only the bitcoin-related research). There are a couple of websites that specialize in IPO data and reports that sell their material online, as Jay Ritter of the University of Florida pointed out to us, but there aren\u2019t any other full-service financial firms doing so. \u201cGiven the global acceleration of entrepreneurial activity surrounding cryptocurrency,\u201d Wedbush wrote, \u201cwe want to help lead the way by being the first U.S. financial institution to begin accepting bitcoin.\u201d The most recent report, by the firm\u2019s Gil Luria and Aaron Turner, advised investors to pay attention to news on bitcoin\u2019s innovation front, rather than the price. \u201cWe believe bitcoin has made strides toward mainstream institutionalization as large retailers and content creators have begun incorporating bitcoin,\u201d they write. If you want to read the rest, well, you can just go online and buy it. The cost is 0.10 BTC. (Paul Vigna) - Once upon a time, before the Internet and social media, before television and radio, the way themes and messages traveled through the culture was essentially through music, through wandering troubadours and sheet music. Think about the story of John Henry, a railroad worker who famously (maybe) took on a steam hammer in a race to build the railroads, at a time when workers were being replaced by machines. So we were taken with a song we heard over the weekend that combines both the old-time culture-bearing job of music with bitcoin. \u201cOde to Satoshi\u201d is a bluegrass-style song with an old-timey feel that mixes references to Satoshi Nakamoto and blockchains (and, ahem, \u201cthe fall of old Mt. Gox\u201d) with mandolin-picking and harmonicas. Part Pete Seeger and part Andreas Antonopoulos\xa0(the song is dedicated to both), it was written and performed by John Barrett, who hosts a podcast called\xa0\u201cBitcoins and Gravy\u201c\xa0out of East Nashville, Tennessee. Lij Shaw, who co-hosts the podcast, engineered the song.  The podcast was Mr. Shaw\u2019s idea (the name \u201cBitcoins and Gravy\u201d was inspired from a song Mr. Shaw did with a band called Eleanor Roosevelt), and is an offshoot of the \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Bitcoin\u201d podcast (of which Mr. Antonopoulos is a co-host). The Tennesseans are part of a pilot program, which includes airing the podcast on KCAA radio in Loma Linda, Calif. \u201cThe bitcoin community here in Nashville is strong and growing stronger by the day,\u201d Mr. Barrett told BitBeat via email. (Paul Vigna) -\xa0While bitcoin\u2019s brain trust tries to get past the transaction malleability hacks, and the damage to the digital currency\u2019s reputation from that, its reputation in the popular culture seems to be growing.\xa0\u201cThe Good Wife\u201d got there fully two years ago, with an episode that centered around bitcoin and its creators. More recently, there was a small reference to bitcoin in\xa0the second episode of season two of the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\xa0It\u2019s not the most glowing reference, \u201cbitcoin laundering\u201d is lumped in with references to child pornography and narcotics. But still, it\u2019s a reference on a hot show. No such thing as bad publicity.

After weeks marked by technological breakdowns, regulatory issues and general questions over its viability, bitcoin is in the midst of the worst crisis since it was proposed in a white paper in 2008.\n\nThe turmoil is a watershed. The way bitcoin and its ecosystem react to the problems could determine whether the whole experiment goes the way of Dutch tulips in the 1600s or becomes a historic technological breakthrough like email. To recap: Bitcoin is a virtual or \u201ccrypto\u201d currency. It isn\u2019t backed by governments or central banks and it exists only online. In fact, it is so \u201ccrypto\u201d that nobody knows who developed it. There is no mint either. Users \u201cmine\u201d bitcoins by using computer algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems. They trade the coins among themselves or spend them on things like tickets to Sacramento Kings basketball games, or at online retailer Overstock.com. Over the past three years, bitcoin has emerged from geekland into the mainstream. Its price skyrocketed from a few cents in 2011 to a high of more than $1,100 in December 2013. More and more merchants started accepting it. And its most ardent friends and foes even predicted that it might one day replace the dollar and other traditional currencies. Bitcoin\u2019s strength is predicated on three supposed qualities: It is anonymous, or at least pseudonymous (transactions are recorded but the identity of the parties is encrypted); it is difficult to hack; and it cuts out financial middlemen like banks. Meyer Malka, whose venture-capital fund Ribbit Capital invests in bitcoin-related firms, calls virtual currencies \u201cthe most disruptive thing I have seen in financial services in my lifetime.\u201d Of late, though, bitcoin\u2019s three bulwarks have come under fire. Its anonymity has caught the attention of regulators and law-enforcement agencies because of alleged money laundering. Its immunity to cyberattacks was called into question last week when the three main bitcoin exchanges had severe problems. And the currency\u2019s place on the fringes of the financial system has proved a limitation because most banks refuse to facilitate bitcoin transactions. To make matter worse, bitcoin\u2019s price now is almost half of what it was at its peak. Ajay Banga, chief executive of Mastercard, spoke for many skeptics last week when he said in an interview: \u201cThe world is not short of currencies, so what is this currency solving for?\u201d That is the crucial question. In order to thrive, bitcoin has to be more useful than current payment systems. Two possible applications could embed virtual currencies into the financial infrastructure in a way that is complementary to existing forms of payments. The first is as conduits for small international transactions like remittances from foreign workers. Bitcoin could reduce both the cost and the time required for such payments. For Antonis Polemitis, this means that consumers should rejoice, and money transmission firms like Western Union and MoneyGram International should worry. \u201cBitcoin is like email and the other stuff is like the post office,\u201d says Mr. Polemitis, who heads Ledra Capital LLC, a family office looking to invest in the bitcoin arena. Tellingly, Benjamin Lawsky, New York\u2019s top financial watchdog, is considering regulating bitcoin firms similarly to money transmitters. The second potential use is further into the future. Supporters like Mr. Malka view bitcoin as more than just a currency used to store value. For them, bitcoin is an open financial platform that could house scores of types of data in a secure and universal ledger. From payments for road tolls to proof of ownership for cars and houses, bitcoin could be an independent, secure and reliable host of financial and personal information. \u201cIt\u2019s not a technology experiment, it is an experimental society,\u201d Mr. Malka says. It sounds far-fetched. Even bitcoin evangelists concede that this could only happen if three conditions materialize. First, the current infrastructure\u2014largely anonymous, anchored by unregulated overseas exchanges and vulnerable to manipulation by criminals\u2014must be overhauled through the creation of U.S. exchanges overseen by financial watchdogs. Second, institutional money like pension funds will have to invest in bitcoin to curb its wild price volatility. And, third, banks will have to view bitcoin as legitimate and enable customers to exchange it for dollars and cents. None of those is a given, and none of those would make bitcoin a replacement for the dollar. But behind all the hype and fear, there is a real possibility that bitcoin will play more than a bit part in the financial industry of the future.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$649.42 \xa0(via\xa0Coindesk) - \xa0While the core development team that looks after bitcoin\u2019s central software\xa0works furiously on a comprehensive fix to the bug that facilitated this week\u2019s debilitating attack against bitcoin exchanges, \xa0there are signs that some temporary fixes are paying off. In one development, Slovenia-based Bitstamp, the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin-to-dollars exchange, announced earlier Friday it expected to resume processing withdrawals later Friday. It also seemed that Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox \u2013 with which much of the week\u2019s problems began \u2014 will soon introduce a new identification system for tracking bitcoin withdrawals. That should protect it against attack and restore operations \u2013 at least according to a post in a bitcoin developers chat room by a user identified as Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox\u2019s CEO. The company could not be immediately reached for confirmation or comment. It\u2019s not clear whether the changes themselves have yet been actually implemented at either exchange. No updates have been made to their web sites\u2019 respective news update streams. Nonetheless, the market seemed encouraged by the news. Bitcoin was last quoted at $649.42, a gain of 8.5% on the day after having been as low as $532.31 earlier Friday, according to an index produced by Coindesk that\u2019s comprises prices from Bitstamp and Cyprus-based BTC-e. It was the first daily gain for the index since the attacks Tuesday, when it came off a high of $708.42. (It should be noted that throughout the week, people have been able to buy and sell bitcoin against their accounts within those enclosed markets, despite restrictions on transferring them to external digital wallets and on withdrawing fiat currencies such as dollars.) These glimmers of hope can be attributed to the work of Jeff Garzik, who is a full-time member of the core development team led by Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen but is on the payroll of payment processor Bitpay. Mr. Garzik told BitBeat he\u2019d been working with exchanges to come up with software fixes that would allow them to clean up and reconcile their accounts, which were hit with a barrage of fraudulent requests for payment that the hacker or hackers unleashed earlier this week. Mr. Andresen hopes that by next week the team can finalize a more permanent fix to the \u201creference implementation.\u201d That\u2019s a piece of standardized software that many exchanges and other bitcoin service providers use to interface with the so-called blockchain, the central transaction ledger at the heart of the bitcoin network. It\u2019s that software, and not the central bitcoin protocol, that contains the bug that was exploited in the hacking attack. (Michael Casey) - Looking to fund an alt.coin startup? Mastercoin is looking for you.\xa0The folks behind mastercoin have put out an \u201copen call\u201d for projects and funds totalling $30 million. In exchange, the group is offering a piece of 150,000 mastercoins it will be releasing. Mastercoin is unusual for an alternative currency, in that it\u2019s built on top of the bitcoin \u201crails,\u201d rather than operating on its own, like say dogecoin. Regardless, it\u2019s become the seventh biggest digital currency since launching in July 2013, according to coinmarketcap, with a market cap around $38 million (dogecoin, by comparison, has a market cap of $83.6 million, and bitcoin\u2019s at $8.2 billion). The developers are offering a fairly sweet pot: those 150,000 mastercoins are a bit more than 25% of the 563,000 currently outstanding. The open call is an extension of the kind of open-source crowdfunding it used previously to raise $5 million.\xa0It\u2019s all loosely part of what\u2019s called bitcoin 2.0, the idea of using the bitcoin protocol to build a whole host of businesses and uses beyond just the currency. Mastercoin, for all the criticisms of it, is a product being built on top of bitcoin. Whether they can raise the 30 large is another question. (Paul Vigna) - Last summer, Mt. Gox was plagued by a series of technical problems that led it to temporarily halt withdrawals (much like its current situation). One customer who we had talked suggested that we actually stand outside the company\u2019s Tokyo headquarters and see first-hand whether the lights were still on, so to speak. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea, but expensing a plane ticket to Japan was out of the question.  But that is exactly what Kolin Burges did. Mr. Burges, a Londoner and Mt. Gox customer, bought himself a plane ticket to Tokyo, and planted himself outside Mt. Gox\u2019s headquarters, as our colleague Takashi Mochizuki reports at Japan Real Time. Standing outside the offices in a snowstorm holding a sign that read \u201cMt. Gox where is our money.\u201d He even managed to get in a brief confrontation with Mark Karpeles, the reclusive CEO of the exchange\u2019s parent company, Tibanne. \u201cYou still have everyone\u2019s\xa0bitcoin?\u201d Mr. Burges\xa0asked while Mr. Karpeles tried to navigate around him holding a coffee cup and umbrella. From our post: Tokyo was blanketed in heavy snowfall on Friday morning, but that didn\u2019t stop Mr. Burges\u2019s protest action at Mt.Gox\u2019s offices in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya district. Taking up position outside the building housing the offices at 8:45 a.m., he encountered Mr. Karpeles, showing up for work around 9:15, a cup from Starbucks in hand. He confronted the French executive, who was reluctant to answer his questions and soon managed to walk past him to get inside the building. Amid the withdrawal halt, trading on Mt. Gox\u2019s exchange has suffered more than at others. Bitcoin prices at Mt. Gox for months had been consistently higher than on other exchanges. Now they are markedly lower. The last quote was $401.89, and that\u2019s up from the day\u2019s low of $302. Part of that discrepancy certainly can be attributed to a trading squeeze, but part of it is seemingly also a vote about Mt. Gox\u2019s solvency and capacity to meet customer demands. (Paul Vigna) - Bitcoin\u2019s nebulous legal status may get clarified in sunny California,\xa0Bitcoin Magazine reports.\xa0A bill winding its way through the state legislature would allow for people or corporations to issue \u201calternative currency.\u201d\xa0While the bill doesn\u2019t seek to put alternative currencies on an equal footing with the coin of the realm, the U.S. dollar, it does seek to create a legal framework for them. \u201cThis bill makes clarifying changes to current law to ensure that various forms of alternative currency such as digital currency, points, coupons, or other objects of monetary value do not violate the law,\u201d a summary of the bill states. (Paul Vigna) -Federal Reserve of Dallas President Richard Fisher is presumably unimpressed by bitcoin. In comments to Bloomberg Radio, he likened it to the \u201cPokemon craze.\u201d We gave this some thought and decided that if Mr. Fisher meant to diss the digital currency, he may not have chosen a good analogy. Pokemon is a massive, global phenomenon. Unlike, say, pet rocks or beanie babies, the craze has lasted and grown. Created as part of a pair of video games \xa0in 1996, the Japanese anime character has since spawned a global Pokemon economy, encompassing a television series, movies, many more games, merchandise and countless web sites to service an enormous, worldwide fan base of anime enthusiasts, gamers and geeks of all ages. Kids will even mimic the sounds made by a Pokemon character known as \u201cpicachu\u201d in what almost amounts to a shared language. The Pokemon economy has thrived off a wellspring of passion and belief. If bitcoin is to succeed, that\u2019s the kind of network effect that needs to happen.

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price:\xa0$609.18 \xa0(via\xa0Coindesk) -An update from the five men at the middle of the storm. Amid the giant hacking attack launched against bitcoin exchanges, it has been a busy week for Gavin Andresen, the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s chief scientist, and the four other members of bitcoin\u2019s core software development team. This tiny, partially volunteer gang is working furiously to identify and fix the problems that facilitated the attacks that forced exchanges such as Mt. Gox, Bitstamp and BTC-e to halt withdrawals this week. When will the bug be fixed? \u201cAt least a week,\u201d said Mr. Andresen when he briefly came up for air for a phone interview Thursday. \u201cA more comprehensive fix will take two or three days to write the code and longer than that to test it and convince ourselves that we didn\u2019t break something else. \u201c Part of the challenge, he said, \u201cis it just takes time to make sure that we really understand what\u2019s causing the problem and not just try to fix the symptoms.\u201d Originally, when Mt. Gox raised concerns on Monday morning about individuals exploiting a software bug to trick it into resending bitcoin when payments had already been made, most members of the bitcoin community argued that there was nothing wrong with any of digital currency\u2019s core software. That applied both to the central software that manages the digital currency\u2019s ledger of transactions, its so-called blockchain, and the \u201creference implementation,\u201d a standardized piece of original software that many, but not all exchanges, use as the interface between their digital wallets and the bitcoin ledger.\xa0 It was acknowledged that a quirk in the core protocol known as transaction malleability allowed fraudsters to try to trick exchanges into sending bitcoin but most at first believed Mt. Gox simply needed to improve compliance procedures at its end. But on Monday afternoon, Gregory Maxwell, one of the five core developers, belatedly identified a bug in the reference implementation. The very next morning a hacker exploited it and sent a barrage of mutated transactions that crippled Bitstamp and BTC-e. The team has been hard at work ever since. Right now, Mr. Andresen and Netherlands-based Bitcoin Foundation employee Wladimir J. van der Laan are drilling down into the reference implementation to understand how the bug works and to figure out how to fix it. Meanwhile, Jeff Garzik, a full-time core development team member paid by bitcoin payment processor Bitpay, is devising patches and \u201cworkarounds\u201d so that exchanges can get back up and running if they wish, Mr. Andresen said. However, some are choosing to wait until the core reference implementation is fixed to assure themselves all is sound. Until then, it seems, customers of such exchanges will be unable to make withdrawals. Where they can, the other two volunteer members of the team, Pieter Wuille, a Switzerland-based employee of Google Inc., and Mr. Maxwell, who works for an open-source software project known as XIPH.org, are pitching in and offering advice. With hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, that\u2019s a lot on these five men\u2019s shoulders, as exchanges, bitcoin payment processors and other service providers press them for answers and solutions. \u201cOne of the real challenges is getting work done when there is a lot of noise,\u201d Mr. Andresen said. \u201cThere is a real danger of trying to do too many things at once or doing things sloppily. And that is probably the biggest challenge: to try to balance being focused but also listen to what everyone is saying, making suggestions, making complaints, accusations.\u201d (Michael Casey) -Crypto justice? Forbes reports that Silk Road 2.0, the site for trading illicit drugs that replaced its predecessor of the same name after Federal enforcement agents shut the latter down, seized its stash of bitcoins and arrested its alleged leader, has been hacked by the same malevolent forces that crippled Mt. Gox and Bitstamp. What\u2019s more, according to an administrator who posts on a Silk Road 2.0 forum under the moniker \u201cDefcon,\u201d the hacker made off with the site\u2019s entire store of bitcoin funds. \u201cI am sweating as I write this\u2026 I must utter words all too familiar to this scarred community: We have been hacked,\u201d Defcon wrote, according to Forbes. \u201cOur initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol known as \u201ctransaction malleability\u201d to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.\u201d The forum\u2019s web site no longer appears to be accessible. Estimates of the amount lost range widely from 4,400 bitcoin ($2.7 million) to 88,000 ($53.6 million.)

Casey. Bitcoin Latest Price: $658.27 (via Coindesk) -As the crisis continues in bitcoin exchanges, alt.coins are discovering the downside of open-source software: It means they inherit the same genetic flaws. You\u2019d think that the turmoil unleashed by attacks that exploit a \u201ctransaction malleability\u201d bug in bitcoin\u2019s core software would provide a big opportunity for litecoin, namecoin, peercoin, quark, ripple and all the other challengers to its crown. But we\u2019re not seeing especially large fresh demand for the alt.coins \u2014 at least not yet. Why not? Well, besides the fact that many don\u2019t trade on the biggest exchanges and that the two that do \u2014 Litecoin and Namecoin \u2014 are also trapped by a withdrawal freeze at BTC-e, a more fundamental problem is that most are built right off the same protocol on which bitcoin is based. They are carrying the very same bug in the hashing algorithm that the bitcoin network uses to ID transactions, the flaw that allows rogue actors to disguise completed transactions and demand undue repayment. That\u2019s the bug that spawned a barrage of denial-of-service attacks that forced the halt in withdrawals by the three biggest bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, Bitstamp and BTC-e. Such is the nature of open-source software. One advantage for newcomers is they are free to copy the original\u2019s strong points. But they\u2019ll also import its flaws. The offspring get the parents\u2019 beauty genes but also their ugliness genes. So, alt.coin coders must also now wait on a global team coordinated by the Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen, which is working around the clock to come up with a fix that can prevent future attacks. The solution, many say, lies in coordinating a response by exchanges to modify how they track transactions. This includes the techies at Litecoin, which is considered to be the biggest challenger to bitcoin. According to coinmarketcap.com, litecoin\u2019s market capitalization is currently worth $437 million, compared with bitcoin\u2019s $8.1 billion. \u201cLitecoin developers are working together with Bitcoin developers to resolve these issues,\u201d said Anton Yemelyanov, a member of the Litecoin development team in an email. \u201cIn fact, this affects all crypto-currencies that have been derived from Bitcoin, or\u2026 rather 3rd party software that interfaces with them.\u201d Litecoin\u2019s price on the BTC-e exchange was last quoted at $$17.05, down from $19.09 on Friday. Between 1000 GMT to 1100 GMT Monday, when the barrage of attacks that forced BTC-e and Bitstamp to follow Mt. Gox into halting withdrawals first hit, the price initially plunged 16.6% to $15.38. Although they all seem to be in it together, fans and developers of alt.coins are still using this as an opportunity to claim superiority over bitcoin. In chat forums some Litecoin enthusiasts pointed out that the network of computers managing its central ledger can more quickly confirm the legitimacy of a transaction \u2013 an average of 2.5 minutes versus 10 minutes for bitcoin \u2013 which narrows the window for attackers to try to trick an exchange into making an undue repayment. (Of course, if an exchange were to just wait for official confirmation and double-check all requests for repayment against its own records, this problem shouldn\u2019t arise in any case.) Supporters of Quark \u2013 market cap $18 million, according to coinmarketcap.com \u2013 circulated a video Wednesday between that digital currency\u2019s two most active promoters, Australian investor Kolin Evans and libertarian YouTube host Bill Still, in which Mr. Evans argued that exchanges won\u2019t be tempted to prematurely honor quark transactions because its network takes just 30 seconds to complete confirmation. (Michael Casey) -Speaking of Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s Mr. Andresen, the man at the middle of the storm, we caught up with him in his small, one-man office in Amherst, MA yesterday. He hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep over the previous 24 hours. \u201cI\u2019m normally very calm,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve caught me at my most stressed.\u201d To talk with us, he\u2019d left a group of the core developers locked in an intense discussion in a chat forum, where they were trying to figure the ideal solution. \u201cWe want to fix it quickly,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t want to move so quickly that we make the problem any worse than it already is.\u201d (Michael Casey) -Happy Valentine\u2019s Day, Bitcoin. Despite all this anxiety, stories of merchants taking up bitcoin for payments continue to reach us from an ever increasing and wider array of industries. Today we heard that Bloomnation, an ETSY-like e-commerce marketplace that allows florists to reach customers online, became the first major flower site to accept the digital currency. With the biggest sales day of the year coming on Friday, it will have a pretty good test case to see if it works. If it works, how will 1-800-Flowers or FTC Inc. or Teleflora respond?\nIt\u2019s probably not a big surprise that Bloomnation was the first to sell flowers for bitcoin. The young startup is funded by Andreessen Horowitz, which has invested in Coinbase and other bitcoin startups. The venture-capital firm\u2019s founder, Marc Andreessen, is one of the most influential bitcoin evangelists. (Michael Casey) -\u201cA fully operational and integrated bitcoin portal system for a large multinational bank.\u201d That\u2019s how a bitcoin software developer Switchless describes the pilot system it set up with a rather large bank, according to a report on Coindesk. Chalk it up as another sign the bitcoin economy is expanding, regardless of the hacking attacks. And it turns out that the name of the bank leaked. It\u2019s Standard Bank, which is based in South Africa and is the biggest bank on that continent. Indeed, Standard is a powerhouse in emerging markets, a region that many think is ripe for bitcoin integration. More \u2018broadly, the notion that a bank of this reputation is developing a site for customers to buy and sell bitcoin will feed the hopes of many in the bitcoin community that major adoption by a hitherto hesitant financial sector is coming soon. Check out the report, which show images of the portal. It could even be interpreted as more bad news for Mt. Gox, Bitstamp and BTC-e.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $644.94 \xa0(via Coindesk) - Attack of the dishonest nodes?\xa0One of the key features of bitcoin, one of the things that makes it a stable system, is this idea that there are a majority of \u201chonest nodes\u201d in the system that could prevent any attack by malefactors. This was explained by Satoshi Nakamoto in his October 2008 white paper that first laid out bitcoin\u2019s parameters, the so-called proof-of-work feature. So long as a majority of CPU power was controlled by the honest nodes, he said, \u201cthe honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.\u201d That may well still hold true, but it\u2019s being put to the test this week. On the heels of the problems at Mt. Gox, which it blamed on a security \u201cglitch,\u201d another bitcoin exchange, Bitstamp, said on Tuesday that it, too, was halting withdrawals, and for the same reason: a software quirk that allows attackers to alter a transaction\u2019s details. It\u2019s being called the \u201cMt. Gox exploit,\u201d but apparently, it\u2019s now being used beyond Mt. Gox. Bitstamp said no funds have been lost, it\u2019s fixing the problem, and expects to \u201cshortly\u201d restore its systems. It may be an even wider attack, though. Andreas Antonopoulos, the chief security officer of Blockchain.info, told CoinDesk\u2019s Emily Spaven that the whole system is under a \u201cmassive and concerted\u201d DDoS attack. In response, an industry-wide counterattack has been instituted, CoinDesk said, including the exchanges, mining pods, and core developers. None of this should really be surprising. Given the frequency of data-breaches in the \u201creal\u201d world \u2014 witness what happened to Target over the holidays \u2014 it was inevitable that somebody, somewhere would eventually probe bitcoin to test its vulnerabilities. Mr. Antonopoulos stressed calm, noted no funds have been lost, and expects this will pass. That isn\u2019t really the issue, though. It\u2019s not going to be enough for bitcoin, or any digital currency for that matter, to be faster and cheaper than cash. It has to be as reliable as cash. More reliable, actually, since it has a bigger burden of proof to present to a skeptical public. Nobody\u2019s going to stop using fiat currencies just because hackers stole their credit-card information. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times the stock exchanges are hit by trading glitches. The habits are too deeply ingrained in people. However, no such store of collective memory and habit and goodwill yet exists for bitcoin.\xa0\u201cThe whole fiasco is just another case study of why it is so important to strengthen ties between bitcoin services and banks and other institutional investors,\u201d Ryan Selkis wrote in his Two-Bit Idiot newsletter. Nakamoto\u2019s honest nodes are being put to the test. They have no choice but to pass that test. (Paul Vigna) - Despite all the bad news lately, bitcoin is not only here to stay, but the world is \u201con the cusp of a revolution in payments systems,\u201d Edmund Moy, the former director of the U.S. Mint, told MoneyBeat. Mr. Moy stopped by the Journal\u2019s offices this morning to talk about cyrpto-currencies, and he sees huge potential for them, both from a commercial and social standpoint. He also thinks, emphatically, that governments should support bitcoin\u2019s development, and that bitcoiners need to take an active role in shaping the government response. It\u2019s one thing to listen to bitcoin\u2019s apostles preaching. It\u2019s another to listen to somebody like Mr. Moy, who worked in D.C., who ran the Mint and is now chief strategist at metals brokerage Morgan Gold. But Mr. Moy, who has a bitcoin wallet, is enthusiastic about crypto-currencies. He really thinks bitcoin and other digital currencies represent an entirely new way of doing commerce, and he expects very big things to start happening. With his background in payment systems (you know, the U.S. dollar) and public service, he\u2019s in a unique position to comment on bitcoin\u2019s development, and he\u2019s been vocal in supporting it. \u201cI believe the government should be encouraging this,\u201d he said. Advances in cryptography are leading to more secure, cheaper, and faster payments systems than anything that existed before, he said, and the \u201csocial ramifications are huge, and positive.\u201d Digital currencies offer a huge advantage to workers looking to send remittances back overseas, he pointed out. \u201cIf you want to help people on the lowest rungs,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t think of a greater transfer of wealth,\u201d than by removing the heavy fees workers are charged now to send money back home. The next few years are going to be key for bitcoin and digital currencies, he said, on both a policy level and on an individual level. He employed the unusual metaphor of roads and flying cars. The oldest roads, like those in lower Manhattan, for example, were basically paved-over footpaths. As the years went on, the government built up and maintained systems based on those old footpaths. Now, he said, imagine somebody invented a flying car. \u201cDo we make it use the existing roads, or do we build a new regulatory system?\u201d To that end, he said it\u2019s critical that bitcoiners take an active role, right now when the currency\u2019s at an inflection point, \xa0in helping to shape whatever regulations governments come up with. In fact, he thinks of one the biggest risks is that government regulations kneecaps digital currencies, although he doesn\u2019t expect it. Ultimately, he thinks the potential of this revolution will be realized, whether the system that emerges is bitcoin or some other currency. \u201cI think people are going to have an \u2018oh, crap\u2019 moment,\u201d when they realize the potential of the new systems, he said, and while he was laughing when it said, he wasn\u2019t joking. (Paul Vigna) - Speaking of the old world engaging the new, we had a chance to catch up with the team at the Chicago Sun-Times that tried that bitcoin micropayments paywall experiment two weeks ago. While they aren\u2019t about to install an actual bitcoin paywall, and aren\u2019t sure in fact what their next move will be, they were greatly encouraged by the test. \u201cI think it was very good,\u201d Jim Kirk, the Sun-Times publisher, told us. \u201cWe thought the test exceeded our expectations.\u201d They said they received 713 bitcoin donations (all of the money paid went to the nonprofit Taproot Foundation, so every hit on the paywall was in fact a donation). The size of those donations was very wide, from a penny all the way up to $1,000. What jumped out at them, though was that the vast majority of donations (63%) were for 25 cents. \u201cIt tells me there is a very special place in someone\u2019s mind that a quarter is something of value,\u201d said Julian Posada, an executive vice president at the paper\u2019s parent company, Wrapports. The executives said the only complaint they heard was that the paywall wasn\u2019t available on their mobile site, and said they\u2019ve heard from a few other media outlets curious about the test, to0. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to get to the same place,\u201d Mr. Posada said. So while there aren\u2019t any definitive next steps, it seems like that there will be a next step, Mr. Kirk said. \u201cThis gives us confidence that we could try a couple of different things.\u201d (Paul Vigna) - Fiverr, an online marketplace,\xa0has partnered up with Coinbase and will start accepting bitcoin. Fiverr is an online site where people offer up their services, with prices starting at $5 (naturally). Some of the services are straightforward, like graphic design. Some are odder, like the person who says they\u2019ll record a voice over\xa0\u201cin the awesome voice of Sean Connery\u201d (that\u2019s worth $5, for sure). \u201cOur community is passionate about innovation and creativity and bitcoin represents this spirit of innovation,\u201d said Constantine Anastasakis, Fiverr\u2019s director of business development.

Now J.P. Morgan head of foreign exchange strategy,\xa0John Normand, has written a research note outlining his thoughts on the virtual currency, and they\u2019re not altogether supportive. It\u2019s not the first time an investment bank has expressed a view on the virtual currency. It\u2019s growing profile has become hard to miss in recent months and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup have already produced research reports on it. Mr. Normand\u2019s note attempts to look at the potential use of Bitcoin as an alternative to existing currencies and payment systems. The prognosis is gloomy. Here\u2019s Mr. Normand: \u201cAt the risk of sounding like a luddite unable to recognize the transformative effects of evolving technologies \u2013\u2013 bitcoin looks like an innovation worth limiting exposure to.\u201d That\u2019s not to say that Mr. Normand does not appreciate some of the perceived benefits of virtual currencies: predictable growth in money supply, verification of transactions to prevent fraud, and reduced transaction costs in some cases. He just does not see bitcoin adequately fulfilling those responsibilities. \u201cAs a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value, it is vastly inferior to fiat currencies. Since governments are quite unlikely to accord it the status of legal tender, bitcoin or other virtual currencies would not reach the scale and scope to render them worthwhile for widespread commerce, payments or investment.\u201d Other drawbacks: A lack of oversight, as well as price volatility that makes moves during the internet bubble look sedate. \u201cEven by dot-com standards, however, these moves are brutal. The Nasdaq only quintupled in value in three years (1997-2000), while bitcoin\u2019s price has risen 50-fold in the past year.\u201d There are also thorny issues of no legal recourse to getting your bitcoin back in event of a theft as well as the limited supply of bitcoin. \u201cWith fixed supply, bitcoin\u2019s deflationary bias should also be clear. That quality serves owners well when exchanging into foreign currency, but it would be onerous for any economy operating with it as legal tender. Indeed Weimar Germany was unpleasant, but so was the Great Depression.\u201d \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Neelabh Chaturvedi', 'email': 'Neelabh Chaturvedi'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/11/j-p-morgan-weighs-in-on-bitcoin/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 11, 12, 0), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Now J.P. Morgan Weighs In on Bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u' The talk of the bitcoin community Monday was something called \u201ctransaction malleability,\u201d an unintended feature of bitcoin\u2019s underlying software that Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox blamed for the problems that led it to halt customer withdrawals on Friday. At first it sounded pretty scary. In a statement, Mt. Gox said \u201ca bug in the bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a sending of bitcoins to a bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it did occur.\u201d According to the exchange, this fraudster trick \u2013which if replicated could deplete any exchange\u2019s working capital \u2014 \u201cis not limited to Mt. Gox, and affects all transactions where bitcoins are being sent to a third party.\u201d Not surprisingly, bitcoin\u2019s price fell again. It traded at about $671 on the CoinDesk price index late Monday, down more than 4.5% from Friday and 41% from its high of roughly $1,150 in December. However, outside of Mt. Gox \u2013 which continues not to respond to interview requests \u2013 the bitcoin community called foul. This problem, many pointed out, was hardly something new. Bitcoin\u2019s core developers had highlighted it since 2011 and it was up to exchanges like Mt. Gox, they said, to develop internal compliance practices that protect themselves from this risk. Before we get into their responses, a bit about how this \u201cMt. Gox exploit,\u201d as some are calling it, works: The attacker changes a special hash code that is used to identify transactions and thereby creates the illusion that a successful transaction never went through. The fraudster then asks for the bitcoin to be resent. Records obtainable through the bitcoin network show that on Sunday alone there were about 4,000 such fraud attempts throughout that network, said Michael Gronager, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based Payward, which runs the Kraken bitcoin exchange. That\u2019s up from 2,000 on Saturday, 1,000 on Friday and from 600-800 in the prior week, he said. Before that, this kind of attack was very rare, said Mr. Gronager, a computer programmer who has worked with the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s core development team on improving bitcoin\u2019s open-source software. And yet most exchanges other than Mt. Gox \u2013 as well as wallet providers, payments processors, and other third-party providers of bitcoin services \u2013 say they are protected. In Kraken\u2019s case, if a user makes a failed payment claim, the exchange manually verifies it through its own accounting records, Mr. Gronager said. It also double-checks by searching for the coins on the bitcoin blockchain \u2013 the universal ledger in which all transactions in the digital currency are recorded \u2013 where they are identifiable by their own unique codes even when the hash code doesn\u2019t match. There was likely something wrong in the way Mt. Gox implemented its procedures and interfaced with the bitcoin software, Mr. Gronager said. It \u201calso seems like they administratively made repayments to customers based on this issue. When dealing with crypto currencies in a professional setting you need to take great care of what you do.\u201d Late Monday, Coinbase, a major provider of digital wallets and bitcoin-based payment services for merchants, said on its blog that a review of its software revealed no instances of transaction malleability attacks. Nonetheless, earlier Monday, it \u201cadded additional security measures to our software to further prevent such an attack.\u201d Jeff Garzik, a programmer at Atlanta-based BitPay, which competes with Coinbase in payment processing, said the company\u2019s support personnel have occasionally dealt with the glitch but that it isn\u2019t significant. \u201cBitPay is not impacted by this issue in routine, day-to-day business,\u201d he said. And over at CoinMKT, a U.S.-based exchange, CEO Travis Skweres said his firm was also protected by sound internal checks and balances. Mt. Gox \u201cscrewed up and any small problem was compounded by how large they are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be very interesting to see if they can dig themselves out of this hole, but I do believe there is nothing wrong with the bitcoin protocol.\u201d The sentiment was echoed by the man most responsible for coordinating improvements to the underlying software. \u201cBasically, we think [Mt. Gox is] overstating it a bit,\u201d said Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, a not-for-profit organization funded by bitcoin-related businesses that\u2019s charged with acting in their collective interest. \u201cIt\u2019s really an unfortunate interaction between what is arguably a flaw in the protocol \u2013 I would could it a quirk, not a flaw \u2014 and Mt.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $668.32 (via CoinDesk) - The light is dimming for bitcoin.\xa0The tone has changed sharply\xa0from the one that existed just before those hearings at the New York State Department of Financial Services. After the cordial reception bitcoin got at those hearings, the future seemed pretty bright. That was only 12 days ago. Since then, the Charlie Shrem arrest has dominated the headlines, the Bank of Russia laid down the hammer and sickle, and Mt. Gox is going through another series of convulsions. The Mt. Gox news is especially pall-inducing. Having the best known bitcoin exchange basically shut down is getting a ton of media attention (yes, from us as well as others), and you can almost hear the doubters sighing. Mt. Gox had to halt customer withdrawals as well last summer, when it was the biggest bitcoin exchange. It\u2019s lost that title since then, and is fast losing the market\u2019s confidence as well. The question now is, do you believe Mt. Gox\u2019s explanation? The exchange on Monday blamed its problems on a quirk in the bitcoin transaction system through which rogue traders could trick exchanges into believing that an otherwise successful bitcoin transfer had failed to go through. But many in the bitcoin community are calling foul, arguing that Mt. Gox just dropped the ball on its own compliance work and made payments to bad eggs who should have been discovered before it was too late. Not surprisingly, various other exchanges are arguing that Mt. Gox fell down on the job, that their own internal checks and balances protect them for these kinds of fraudsters, and that the glitch is isolated to the Tokyo-based exchange rather than being \xa0a system-wide problem. Mt. Gox did not respond to a request for additional comment. Yet whoever you believe about the seriousness of this potential fraud loophole \u2014 known as \u201ctransaction malleability\u201d \u2014 someone or some people have been ramping up their use of it. \xa0Michael Gronager, COO from Kraken, a \xa0U.S.-based exchange that currently specializes in trading euros for bitcoin, said attacks that exploit transaction malleability have grown rapidly from being almost non-existent in the bitcoin economy a couple of weeks ago to 4,000 false claims \xa0for non-payment on Sunday alone. Meanwhile, another blow to bitcoin came from Mother Russia. The Bank of Russia effectively banned bitcoin in the homeland, arguing it can be used to finance terrorism. The bank said \u201cmoney substitutes\u201d like bitcoin are illegal. The ruble is the only legal tender. Russia\u2019s stance is not exactly surprising, and it joins China in being one of the few nations to take an outright stand against bitcoin. On that the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s Mr. Andresen simply had this to say: \u201cIf the ruble was the only currency you can use in Russia, I\u2019m not sure how they would trade with the rest of the world.\u201d Bitcoin prices have been falling steadily throughout the media storms. After trading in what was (for bitcoin) a relatively stable channel between $800-$1,000 for a few months, prices are in the $600 range right now, and we saw a day\u2019s low of $530 on bitstamp and $102 on BTC-e. Granted, it doesn\u2019t take a lot to move bitcoin prices and Mt. Gox\u2019s numbers were distorting Coindesk\u2019s index \u2014 a problem that won\u2019t exist any longer. (See below.) After a wild 2013, we expected 2014 to be as eventful. So far, it is, but it\u2019s still surprising how fast it\u2019s all happening. (Paul Vigna/Mike Casey) - While we\u2019re talking about the Bank of Russia, and bitcoin\u2019s legal status, we were reminded of bitlegal, a website that tracks bitcoin\u2019s legal status across the globe, and was brought to our attention by Zachary Taylor (yes, that\u2019s his real name, just like the president). Worth a look, and a bookmark. - Okay, dogecoiners, you got us.\xa0It may surprise people who don\u2019t even know about bitcoin to learn that there are number of alternative, electronic currencies out there. They include litecoin, Ripples, Mastercoin, Quark, the soon-to-come auroracoin (for Icelanders)\u2026and dogecoin, a newcomer that started out just in December as something of a joke \u2014 the \u201cdoge\u201d refers to an Internet meme that involves Shiba Inus and various sayings and haikus. But it\u2019s grown rapidly, thanks in part we assume to a rabid fan base. After a raucous party in downtown Manhattan that ended with the Shiba emblem stuck to the Wall Street bull statue, this fan base decided over the weekend to make it their goal to get BitBeat to write about their favorite currency. One acolyte posted his email to us on a reddit board, and encouraged others to also write us. They did. A lot. Granted, dogecoin has gone from Internet meme to one of the top five alt-coins in a matter of months, and granted there are also some features to it that may even improve upon bitcoin\u2019s system. Certainly, having fun and encouraging others to do the same can be a very effective strategy to build buzz and goodwill. That the community was able to donate enough doegcoins (more than $30,000) to get the Jamaican bobsled team to the Sochi Olympics was a stroke of marketing genius. But it\u2019s worth remembering, too, that in the world of virtual currencies, there is almost no barrier to entry, and the success or failure of a system will depend upon its utility and its supporters. Because ultimately all these currencies \u2013\xa0whether its dogecoin, bitcoin, or the U.S. dollar\xa0\u2013 are really just tools that aid commerce and business. How well they achieve that goal is the real measure of success. On the other hand, it\u2019s hard to take seriously a currency based on dog haikus. So, there you go, dogecoiners. We\u2019ve answered your fervent request, and to show how simpatico we are with your cause, we composed our own dogecoin haiku: Dogecoin fans write us\nBegging for some attention.\nShiba cracks hard snow. (Paul Vigna/Mike Casey) - Mt. Gox\u2019s explanation of its trading halt, that it\u2019s all apparently due to a technical glitch, isn\u2019t cutting the mustard over at CoinDesk, which announced on Monday that it was dropping Mt. Gox pricing from its aggregate bitcoin price index. This is certainly more a blow to Mt. Gox\u2019s reputation than its actual operations, but given the state of its operations, it can\u2019t afford any blows right now to any part of its business. \u201cThe ability of exchange customers to obtain timely withdrawals is a criterion of the Bitcoin Price Index,\u201d the site, a well known source of news and data, wrote in a long post explaining the decision. \u201cMt. Gox has been unable to consistently meet this criterion.\u201d For now, the index comprises only two indexes: bitstamp and BTC-e. CoinDesk product manager Jeremy Bonney said the site has not replaced Mt. Gox in the index yet, but the team is discussing possible additions. Additionally, the independent site BitcoinAverage,\xa0which we mentioned last week, has dropped Mt. Gox from its average, \u201cuntil such time as they sort out their custom wallet software and continue to process customer withdrawals,\u201d according to a spokesman. (Paul Vigna) - It may seem like all those \u201cguess who\u2019s taking bitcoin now\u201d stories have been permanently halted, but they\u2019ve just been buried under the juicier stuff. Still, it\u2019s been our position that bitcoin\u2019s future depends more upon the former kinds of stories than the latter. To that end, here\u2019s a potentially significant one: a section of eBay U.K. site will open a virtual-currency category, according to Mashable, allowing customers to putting up listings for bitcoin, dogecoins, and any others that emerge. The transactions themselves will still need to be completed via a fiat currency. After the move by Overstock to start accepting bitcoin, the watch has been on to see if other online retailers would follow suit. Consider this eBay\u2019s first toe-dip in the water.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $725.97 \xa0(via Coindesk) Oh, Mt. Gox. When one of the larger crypto-currency exchanges has a problem, the entire bitcoin trading universe has a problem. So it was with BTC China back in December, and so it was with Japan-based Mt. Gox today. The embattled Mt. Gox was already having problems, following a host of disruptions to its service and months-long shutdowns of dollar withdrawals due to problems setting up a U.S. banking relationship. But on Friday the exchange went to the next extreme, halting all customer withdrawals, including those in yen, which had provided a backdoor exit, albeit a convoluted one, for its frustrated U.S. customers. Not that long ago, before its troubles steered investors to alternative exchanges such as BitStamp in Slovenia, Mt. Gox claimed to account for 80% of all trading. That left a lot of money Frozen in its accounts. So it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that Friday\u2019s news prompted the price of bitcoin on the Coindesk index to drop as much as 16% to an intraday low of $658.83. It later rebounded and was recently quoted near $726. What\u2019s also striking is that the drop almost wiped out the $100 spread that had existed between Mt. Gox\u2019s higher price for bitcoin and that on Bitstamp or on BTC-e, an exchange whose address is variously described as being in Bulgaria and Cyprus. In effect, the freeze on dollar withdrawals and the understandable perception of Mt. Gox as a risky counterparty forced a premium into the price. Still it was always a bit baffling why that spread existed. One way or another the opportunity for people to game the system \u2013 buying bitcoin on Bitsamp, selling it on Mt. Gox and exiting via yen for dollars \u2013 should have traded away the arbitrage opportunity. Perhaps the headache of withdrawals and cross-currency juggling was too much even for resourceful arbitrageurs. But now the spread has narrowed significantly \u2013 it was down to only about $25 Friday \u2013 and while there\u2019s no official explanation on why that happened, it does appear associated with the Mt. Gox closure. A big surge in trading volume can be seen on the Mt. Gox trading site early Friday. Perhaps one or a group of big investors got fed up with waiting and rushed to get their dollars out of the yen window, leaving the exchange stripped of funds. Company executives weren\u2019t immediately available for comment. In a letter to clients posted on its site, Mt. Gox said an increase in withdrawal requests \u201chas hindered our efforts on a technical level\u201d and that to \u201cunderstand the issue thoroughly, the system needs to be in a static state.\u201d Either way, the snafu reflects the ongoing teething problems of an industry struggling to keep pace with the rapidly growing amount of bitcoin transactions and trading. Bitcoiners are hoping that once a proper, SEC-accredited exchange is created that allows hedge funds and other large institutions to trade and hedge in bitcoin, this disruptions might become less frequent. We\u2019ll see. Our sense is that volatility will be par for the course for a while in bitcoin-land. (Mike Casey) Not great news for bitcoin out of Cyprus, either.\xa0 As Matina Stevis reports, the Cypriot central bank has had some harsh-ish words to say about digital currencies. In reference to them, it said in a statement that it \u201cdoes not approve any activity that falls within its purview, unless it can ensure the legality of that activity. Activities without the necessary licensing are in breach of legislation.\u201d This comes as a blow for bitcoiners, who looked to various bitcoin-friendly developments in Cyprus as signs that the government was open to bitcoin helping it create an innovation hub in the tiny Mediterranean nation. The University of Nicosia had even said it would accept bitcoin for tuition, rent and books. Still, as Matina points out, the statement was worded such that bitcoin holders in Cyprus \u2013 including those associated with BTC-e, no doubt \u2013 are \u201cwarned, but still legal.\u201d They\u2019ll take what they can get. After all, this was the country whose move to tax bank deposits at the height of a financial crisis 11 months ago helped spur interest in digital currency safe havens and triggered one the first mega-rallies in the bitcoin price. (Mike Casey) The U.S. Postal Service\u2019s bitcoin ATMs are ready, sort of.\xa0 Last week, the USPS\xa0Inspector General\u2019s office began looking into whether or not the postal service should get involved in \u201cdisruptive technologies,\u201d including bitcoin. Given how much money the post office has been losing, and the dim prospects for its mainstay business, it\u2019s not surprising they\u2019re looking afield for new opportunities. After all, it\u2019s not like the Pony Express is coming back any time soon. Ideas including acting as a physical space for bitcoin exchanges, or installing bitcoin ATMs. The post office is also exploring ways it can be of service to what\u2019s called the \u201cunderbanked\u201d population, and it\u2019s certainly possible bitcoin could play a role there. If they decide upon installing ATMs, Lamassu is stands ready to help. The start-up, founded by brothers Zach and Josh Harvey, started selling its bitcoin ATMs in August. They\u2019ve sold nearly 200 so far, starting at $5,000 a pop. After reading about the post office\u2019s interest, the brothers decided to make their own mock-ups of a USPS bitcoin ATM. \u201cIt\u2019s all in good spirts,\u201d Zach told MoneyBeat, \u201cmostly for fun.\u201d But, seriously, USPS, if you\u2019re interested, we can put you in touch. The Alt.coin market continues to heat up.\xa0 Maxcoin, the new crypto-currency project named for \u2013 and eagerly endorsed by \u2013 firebrand television presenter Max Keiser, launched Friday after being forced into a 24-hour delay due to heavy activity on its site Thursday. Mr. Keiser is an early crypto-currency evangelist who is believed to own a large pool of bitcoin. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been hearing from the creators of Quark, who tout their currency\u2019s higher transaction speeds than bitcoin\u2019s and improved security built around multiple forms of encryption. A YouTube video released by the Quark Foundation this week says the protocol will release a total of 247 million quark into the market, with an additional 1 million to be issued every year after that, ensuring its value if \u201cmore stable, less volatile.\u201d Quark can only be mined by computers with normal CPUs, which the Foundation says \u201cdecentralizes its control dramatically,\u201d a claim that\u2019s clearly aimed at differentiating itself from what some fear will be increasing concentration of bitcoin mining power in the hands of those owning ever-more powerful computers.

Several thousand miles away on the tiny island of Cyprus, the central bank has weighed in on the virtual currency too, and it\u2019s not happy. Throughout this year, Cyprus has been touted in the media as fertile ground for Bitcoin growth. Remember that, since March, it\u2019s had capital controls in place, leaving residents cash-restricted.

I have to say that personally I\u2019m still learning regarding this bitcoin phenomenon because I think it\u2019s a very interesting phenomenon on a global scale.

Not quite. Instead it warns that there are big risks associated with using the currency. As an example, it cites the absence of legal guarantees around the ownership of Bitcoin, high volatility in its price, and possible use of Bitcoin for \u201cabuse for illegal activities.\u201d Where does this leave the keen Bitcoin holders in Cyprus?

Gox suspended all withdrawals from its accounts. According to an index provided by Coindesk that amalgamates prices from Mt. Gox and two other exchanges, bitcoin was recently quoted down 7.48% on the day at $725.04. The move coincided with a collapse in what had been a big spread between the price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox and on other major exchanges. Until Friday, bitcoin was fetching up to $100 more on Mt. Gox than on the two other biggest exchanges\u2013Bitstamp of Slovenia and BTC-e, a company that is variously described as being from Bulgaria or Cyprus. Recently Friday, the price on Mt. Gox is quoted at $737.99, whereas on Bitstamp it was at $720.13 and on BTC-e it was $721.20. The premium previously demanded on Mt. Gox reflected the fact that even before Friday\u2019s development, its customers were having trouble getting dollars out. Mt. Gox didn\u2019t have a banking partnership in the U.S. and it had been through a host other problems stemming from previous disruptions to its trading operations. That meant customers who wanted to go directly into dollars had to risk leaving their money tied up with a troubled exchange based in a foreign country or stay holding bitcoin. Evidently, many decided to do the latter. Some bitcoin traders were selling bitcoin for yen to get out of the exchange and, in some cases, to profit from an arbitrage opportunity. Some speculators said they were buying bitcoin for dollars on exchanges like Bitstamp and then selling it for yen on Mt. Gox before translating back into dollars at a profit. The number of people doing so was seemingly sufficiently small that the price differential didn\u2019t collapse. Trading on Mt. Gox spiked earlier Thursday, according to a chart on its website. It wasn\u2019t clear what caused the surge. Bitcoin, the most prominent of a host of new virtual currencies, are created by a global network of digital \u201cminers,\u201d whose computers discover them via complex computations and then serve as protectors of the integrity of the virtual money supply. An encryption system allows them to be transferred internationally between digital \u201cwallets\u201d without the need for a third-party intermediary or underlying transfer of cash. Mt.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $781.86 (via CoinDesk) - The big news in the bitcoin world today is word that Apple has dropped a popular bitcoin wallet from its App Store.\xa0Blockchain, a bitcoin wallet service, offered its iPhone app through the Apple store for two years. The app, which has been downloaded more than 120,000 times, was dropped by Apple on Wednesday. Apple declined to comment. Blockchain has been vocal in its response, but that doesn\u2019t match the outrage of the bitcoin community, who took the move very personally. \u201cI am livid, just like so many of you,\u201d wrote Ryan Selkis, who publishes the \u201cTwo-Bit Idiot\u201d daily newsletter. \u201cFor them to backdoor their users like this on Bitcoin makes me want to start an uprising. \xa0(I think others may have already started it though.)\u201d He\u2019s right about that, and nothing compares to the ire of one certain bitcoiner - who shot his iPhone in response. A bitcoiner named Ryan (not Mr. Selkis), of\xa0Ryan\u2019s Range Report, took his iPhone 4S out to what looks like a private range \u2014 and shot it. Several times.\xa0He was prompted by a reader on reddit, who promised to send a Nexus 5 to the first five people to smash their iPhones.  \xa0 - Bitcoin\u2019s bid for legitimacy on Wall Street got a lift when Perseus Telecom, a provider of heavy-bandwidth connections to securities exchanges and their customers, said it would start accepting bitcoin. CEO Jock Percy said the impetus came more from Perseus\u2019s growing \xa0band of customers among the global online gaming industry rather than from its traditional financial services clients. But he added that his firm\u2019s move is a way to position for a likely expansion of bitcoin-related transactions among hedge funds, high-speed trading firms, banks and exchanges. \xa0 Is Bitcoin money? The debate rages, but Payden & Rygel, a global fund manager with $80 billion under management, appears to have come down pretty solidly on the \u201cyes\u201d side \u2013 or at least believes that it will become money.

Money needs neither government nor regulatory approval. Money is more an adjective than a noun, a way to make trade easier and holds no intrinsic value.\u201d That sounds like a rejoinder both to those in the pro-fiat currency camp who take issue with bitcoin\u2019s lack of on official imprimatur and to gold bugs, who say money must be backed by something of tangible value. \u201cIssues remain for Bitcoin,\u201d Payden & Rygel goes on to say, \u201cbut it exemplifies the movement of currency in the 21st\xa0century. We might bid farewell to the exclusivity of issuance characteristic of the 20th century and welcome a freer and looser regime of money where users and vendors exchange whichever currency most conveniences them.\u201d According to Payden & Rygel spokeswoman Kimberly Tipton, the \u201cPoint of View\u201d report is mailed out in both printed and electronic form to around 20,000 recipients around the world, a group that encompasses investor clients, prospects, financial intermediaries and reporters like us.

But we haven\u2019t seen any reports on how these retailers were faring with bitcoin, until now. An Australian electronics retailer, Millennius, has been accepting bitcoin (and litecoin) for six months now, and released a report breaking down its experience. While its bitcoin customer base remains small, the retailer has found one very interesting thing: customers using bitcoin spend more. Bitcoin comprises about 5% of total purchases for the retailer. Credit cards come first, at 63%, and PayPal is next, at 29%. But, critically, the company found that people paying via bitcoin spent more per order. Bitcoin purchases on average totaled $831.71, compared to $686.74 for credit card orders, and $314.00 for PayPal orders. It also found that orders lost to fraud on bitcoin purchases were 0%, compared to 2.7% for credit-card orders.

Bitcoin Latest Price: $842.11 (via CoinDesk) -\xa0How much is a bitcoin really worth? Tracking bitcoin\u2019s price is tricky, and not just because it tends to be a little more volatile than other currencies. There are a number of outlets that report bitcoin prices, and they all tend to be just a bit (no pun intended) different. There\u2019s Mt. Gox, Coinbase, CoinDesk, Bitstamp, among others. For consistency sake, we here at the Journal chose to cite CoinDesk when we report on prices.

It is in discussions about setting up ATMs at shopping centers, casinos, airports and other commercial centers. When the first bitcoin ATMs popped up in Canada, the idea confused people. If you\u2019re out shopping, why would you put cash into a machine to buy digital currency when you could always shop with the same cash? The answer is because buying bitcoin is still often quite cumbersome and time-consuming. Many BTC exchanges bar the use of credit cards and the few that do allow direct deposits from \xa0your bank account often require a lengthy approval process. Until online purchases of bitcoin are easier from your home computer, ATMs could be a convenient way for people to top up their digital wallets. \xa0(Mike Casey) - Film Annex will go to an all-bitcoin payment model. The site, which has made waves with a radical new business model by which it shares part of its ad revenue with the independent film makers and bloggers that provide its content, has alerted its contributors that by mid-August they\u2019ll be paid in the digital currency. As with many early bitcoin adopters, there\u2019s a certain synergy between the company\u2019s disruptive business model and the disruptive payments model that bitcoin represents. \u201cWe really believe [bitcoin] is the future for digital platforms,\u201d says Mike Sweeney, Managing Partner at Film Annex Capital Partners. While the company is already getting some pushback from some its contributors, it\u2019s determined to go through with it. A key motivation revolves around Film Annex\u2019s engagement with a community of some 6,000 content providers in Afghanistan, most of them women, via a collaboration with influential female Afghan IT entrepreneur Roya Mahoob. Whereas Film Annex was previously sending its payments to those people via Western Union money transfers, there were concerns about these women having to carry cash through a dangerous city like Kabul. Bitcoin gets around that risk. Film Annex\u2019s payments model is built around an algorithm that assesses the extent of a video or blog\u2019s impact via its social media \u201cbuzz\u201d and rewards the provider accordingly.

It goes way beyond just \u201caltcoin,\u201d explaining FinCEN, Gamification, and UIGEA, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act. Wonky, valuable stuff. In the News: - One of bitcoin\u2019s problems is adoption,\xa0convincing people and businesses to use it. In Iceland, the proponents of an alternative electronic currency called Auroracoin have a solution to this problem: They\u2019re giving the coins to every Icelander. On March 24, the currency\u2019s backer plan to \u201cairdrop\u201d about 32 Auroracoins into individual accounts for every single resident of Iceland, according to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWhere Bitcoin has had an uphill battle with those who don\u2019t understand or dislike cryptocurrencies, this gift,\u201d Ruben Alexander wrote, \u201cmay be persuasive enough to give this new currency quick adoption among its citizens and throughout the world.\u201d Iceland was the epicenter of one of the worst debacles of the Panic of 2008, when the island nation\u2019s entire banking system collapsed under the weight of bad debt on the balance sheets of its major banks. Auroracoin\u2019s backers are hoping their alternative currency will appeal to residents still scarred by 2008. It\u2019s unclear yet if that\u2019s true.

High profile retailers like Overstock got on board. Ben Bernanke talked about it, and\xa0even the U.S. Congress showed interest, holding high-profile hearings. But if bitcoin is going to become the kind of mainstream product its biggest acolytes expect it to be, they\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in boosting its profile. To the general public, bitcoin is not a mystery. They haven\u2019t even heard of it. \xa0Fully three-quarters of U.S. residents are not familiar\xa0with bitcoin, and nearly 80% wouldn\u2019t even consider using it, a new study from TheStreet and research firm GfK found. The survey illustrates the fact that bitcoin \u201cis nowhere near the level right now that it should be if the bitcoin supporters really want if it\u2019s to be considered as an alternative currency,\u201d Joseph Deaux, TheStreet\u2019s economics analyst, who came up with the idea for the survey, told MoneyBeat. \u201cI was a little surprised at the high number of people who admitted they had no familiarity with the term at all.\u201d \u201cIn our world of business finance,\u201d he said, \u201cif you haven\u2019t heard of bitcoin it\u2019s like you\u2019re not paying attention.\u201d But that is almost the polar opposite of what the survey found for the public. That shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. Despite the interest, bitcoin\u2019s total market cap remains tiny, around $10.4 billion lately, according to CoinDesk, which puts it on a level with smaller currency markets like the Hungarian forint. Of course, it is a product that is only entering its sixth year of existence, and only last year expanded beyond the small bands of technophiles, libertarians and malefactors, who had been its chief supporters. That may well change. While most of the news these days is about who\u2019s the latest retailer, dentist, or even sports team to accept bitcoin, the more interesting developments may come from venture capitalists like Fred Wilson at Union Square and entrepreneurs like Barry Silbert at SecondMarket, who are looking to build businesses on top of the existing bitcoin protocol. But bitcoin may still be a nonstarter among the average Joe\u2019s out there, as evidenced by TheStreet survey. Mr. Deaux himself thinks bitcoin could go either way, although he acknowledges the concept and execution of it sounds \u201cpretty sharp.\u201d But, he said, it\u2019s asking of lot of people and markets to take their general concepts of economics and finance, push them aside, and say, \u201chey, give it a shot.\u201d (An earlier version of this post incorrectly noted Mr. Deaux\u2019s title as economics editor; he is TheStreet\u2019s economics analyst.)', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/05/most-people-still-dont-know-what-bitcoin-is-and-dont-care-to-know/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 5, 17, 13), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Most People Still Don&rsquo;t Know What Bitcoin Is, and Don&rsquo;t Care to Know'}, {'articleText': u' Welcome to BitBeat, our daily round-up of\xa0bitcoin\xa0news, notes, and thoughts. The crypto-currency had a hectic 2013, and the new year is already shaping up as a manic one as well. So far, there has been a high-profile hearing on bitcoin\u2019s future, and a high-profile arrest of a bitcoin apostle, and while the price has been stable, another wild rally, or brutal sell-off, could come at any moment. We\u2019ll do our best to keep you up to date on all the happenings as bitcoin goes through what many expect to be an important year. Bitcoin latest price: $847.47 (via CoinDesk) - It may seem odd that, having accepted the idea of an electronic currency that isn\u2019t backed by any government or bank and exists only in the 1\u2032s and 0\u2032s of a computer code, that we\u2019d have trouble wrapping our minds around other unusual concepts, but a release we got from a start-up called\xa0Bionym kind of blew our minds. The firm makes a wristband that monitors your heartbeat, called the nymi, and uses your heartbeat for identification and a \u201cpassword\u201d for all your other devices, from your car to your computer to your coffeeshop. A heartbeat, the firm says, is unique to each person, and thus can be used as a personal identification. Who knew? The firm announced today that among the wristband\u2019s initial applications (release is slated for mid-2014, according to the firm) will be a bitcoin wallet. The nymi will act as the private key for the wallet, making it far more secure. \u201cThe wallet is physically stored on the Nymi,\u201d Yevgeniy Vahlis the firm\u2019s chief cyrptographer, said in a release. \u201cThe Nymi\u2019s multi-factor system, including its ECG biometric, ensures secure Bitcoin storage tied to the rightful owner.\u201d \xa0 - Another first in the digital-currency adoption story: Foreigners and accredited investors can now use bitcoin to take small investment stakes in real estate projects via crowdfunding marketplace RealtyShares. It may well be the first opportunity for bitcoin holders to invest in real-world assets that are outside the enclosed bitcoin or digital-currency economy. (Bitcoin is, of course, used for trading in the currency itself, as well as in its alt.coin competitors, and various startups based on or around the bitcoin protocol raise funds in digital currencies.) In RealtyShares\u2019 case, the site allows foreign investors to fairly seamlessly take stakes in the U.S. residential and commercial real-estate markets \u2013 with investments of as little as $1,000 in some cases \u2013 and to do so without the onerous transaction of an international wire or the red tape and time delays that are usually involved. We found one investor in Tallinn, Estonia, who sees it as a chance to put to use the 22 bitcoin he acquired last year when the Russian buyer of his Volkswagen van insisted that the transaction be done in the digital currency. (Mike Casey) \xa0 - Jamie Dimon might have called bitcoin a \u201cterrible store of value\u201d on CNBC last month, but if Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, is to be believed, many of the J.P. Morgan Chase chief\u2019s peers are very keen on it. \u201cI can say with confidence that 2014 will be the year of bitcoin on Wall Street,\u201d Mr Silbert said during a conference call Tuesday to discuss themes surrounding the digital currency. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many individuals I meet or meetings I go to where I\u2019m asked to talk about bitcoin, but I can tell you it involves the most senior people at the some of the largest banks and funds here on Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile there is a lot skepticism on CNBC, some of the smartest and most well-known investors have invested in bitcoin via the Bitcoin Trust,\u201d said Mr. Silbert, who made his name in setting up the private exchange SecondMarket. The Bitcoin Investment Trust is limited at this stage to sophisticated institutions and high-net-worth individuals. He said there has been a \u201cfantastic response\u201d to the Trust and \u201cwe haven\u2019t done any sales or marketing. And by the way, we\u2019re hiring.\u201d (Mike Casey) Here are the slides from Mr. Silbert\u2019s presentation:  Speaking on the same conference call as Mr. Silbert, Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple Labs, said his firm\u2019s global digital-currency exchange has processed some $40 million in transactions over the last 60 days. He said that the network, which is built on a decentralized structure akin to the bitcoin protocol but which operates independently of bitcoin, now has 63,000 independent \u201cnodes.\u201d These function as market makers for trading currencies via an encrypted system or as gateways for people to buy or sell XRP, the Ripple protocol unit, in return for fiat currencies or other units of value. The value of XRP in market capitalization terms now stands at $2 billion, he added, without elaborating on how that number is reached. (Based on discussions in different chat forums for users of digital currencies, there\u2019s some debate over how best to measures XRP\u2019s market cap, which the company derives by multiplying the last price at which an XRP transaction occurred by the number of XRP units that Ripple has issued.) (Mike Casey) - Mt. Gox hasn\u2019t been in the news much lately,\xa0partially because it\u2019s lost its mantle as the biggest bitcoin exchange. But it\u2019s still a big name in the market, so what happens there counts. There are increasing reports of withdrawal problems at the exchange. \u201cComplaints about its service from customers are growing,\u201d CoinDesk\u2019s Joon Ian Wong wrote in a post today. The site notes that one online forum on the issue has more than 3,300 posts, and CoinDesk is conducting an online poll. This isn\u2019t Mt. Gox\u2019s first run-in with disgruntled customers: last summer the exchange had similar problems, and actually suspended withdrawals for two weeks before resuming them in July.

Tom Carper, chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, released a report on Monday that summarizes the legal status of virtual currencies in 40 nations as well as the European Union, a release from the Senator\u2019s office said. The upshot of the report? \u201cThe United States may not be as far behind the curve on virtual currencies as some have argued,\u201d Sen. Carper said. \u201cWhile there is no consistent or clear definition or treatment of digital currencies throughout the world, this report underscores that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are present and growing in major economies.\u201d - CheapAir.com\xa0has announced it is accepting bitcoin for hotel reservations and says it is the first U.S. online travel agency to do so.

The Chicago Sun-Times, the ninth largest U.S. paper, is conducting a 24-hour experiment on Saturday: For the entire day, readers will be able to buy access to the site, or just access to individual stories, via bitcoin. It\u2019s an unusual undertaking for what Julian Posada, an executive vice president at the paper\u2019s parent company, Wrapports, describes at the city\u2019s \u201cblue-collar\u201d paper and its readership of average Joe\u2019s, but these are unusual times. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t expect the Sun-Times of Chicago to be testing bitcoin,\u201d he told MoneyBeat. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique thing for us to put in front of our readers.\u201d The Sun-Times and bitcoin may not exactly seem a likely pair, but the media industry has been under pressure for years, and Mr. Posada said he, publisher Jim Kirk and Josh Metnick, Wrapports\u2019 chief technology officer, were all willing to take a chance on an experiment with a new business model and a new currency. After offering up their content for free for years, newspapers increasingly are installing paywalls on their websites. The Sun-Times has a $9.99 monthly subscription rate for its site. But bitcoin offers the promise of an entirely different kind of paywall. There has been a lot of buzz in the bitcoin world lately about what\u2019s called \u201cmicropayments.\u201d Because bitcoin transaction charges are so low, and because bitcoins themselves can be divided down to the eighth decimal place, it allows merchants to realistically charge extremely low prices, like a penny. For a media company, for example, that makes it feasible to sell individual articles as opposed to a blanket monthly fee. On Saturday, Sun-Times readers will be able to buy access to the site via bitcoin, or by sending out messages on Twitter. For the experiment, readers aren\u2019t actually paying the Sun-Times. All the money is being routed to a nonprofit, the Taproot Foundation.\xa0A San Francisco startup called\xa0BitWall\xa0will be operating the paywall for the paper. BitWall is a third-party merchant that runs paywalls. BitWall allows for several different ways to pay. Sending out a tweet linking to the site gets you a three-hour pass on the site. Readers can pay 3 cents for a 24-hour pass, or 1 cent to view a single article. The goal of this, Mr. Posada explained, isn\u2019t to raise money, but to see it if works. And if it does, he said, it won\u2019t be the end of their bitcoin experimenting. \u201cThis is not a one-and-done,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think any of us have that luxury anymore.\u201d He has no idea how it will fare. He\u2019s stressed to his customer-service staff to make notes of every single response, good or bad. But he\u2019s optimistic. Mr. Posada noted that the bitcoin community will be watching this carefully, this idea of a blue-collar, traditional, Midwest newspaper experimenting with this brand-new, largely untest, even controversial alternative currency. What he didn\u2019t say, but which is probably just as true, is that bitcoiners won\u2019t be the only ones watching.

The strong sense from both sides was that regulation is coming, that it will be a good thing, and that bitcoin has already crossed the point where it\u2019s just a passing fad. Indeed, one panelist said that bitcoin\u2019s already passed its \u201ctipping point,\u201d at which it could have slipped deeper into the criminal world and disappear or turn mainstream. It\u2019s moving toward the mainstream Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. \u201cThe trend is very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cAs an investor, I\u2019m putting my money on that case.\u201d The hearing was a \u201chuge opportunity to set the right tone,\u201d said Cameron Winklevoss, a panelist along with his twin brother, Tyler. The two operate Winklevoss Capital Management. Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services,\xa0flanked by three other officials from his department, kept the proceedings informal. He encouraged the panelists to think of it more like a conversation than a hearing and asked a series of broad questions. He even seemed sympathetic when he complained about having to wait three days to transfer money from his savings account at his bank to pay his monthly credit card bill at the same bank. That said, he also clearly believes that bitcoin is going to have to come under some kind of regulation. \u201cTweaks around the edges are not enough,\u201d Mr. Lawsky said between panels, suggesting the the department would come up with something within several months. He has been talking about developing something he\u2019s calling a \u201cbitlicense\u201d for firms that want to operate as bitcoin brokers or exchanges. The hearing wasn\u2019t open to the general public, but was open to the press and the packed room gave some sense of the interest. Mr. Lawsky is not just as a regulator, but a regulator in New York, with oversight of the nation\u2019s financial heart. Whatever he decides to do will carry ramifications beyond the state lines. The experts also appeared receptive to the idea of some regulation, too, albeit cautiously. Mr. Liew said he thought applying existing laws to bitcoin transactions was a better idea than developing wholly new regulations. \u201cMy feeling is the existing framework is adequate to prevent fraud,\u201d he said. Speaking of fraud, the first question was about the Charlie Shrem arrest, and the panelists seemed to think the fact that he got caught was in itself an illustration that the system works. It was also notable that nobody actually talked about him by name. While bitcoin does have a somewhat notorious connotation with criminal elements, a connotation that will only be strengthened should Mr. Shrem be found guilty, Mr. Liew said that criminals were not a very lucrative market anyhow. \u201cThe market of radical libertarians is not very big and the market of criminals is not very big.\u201d The market that is big is the general public, he said, and that\u2019s where bitcoin\u2019s future lies. \u201cIt seems like the system is working,\u201d said Barry Silbert, founder of SecondMarket and the Bitcoin Investment Trust, citing bitcoin\u2019s \u201cpublic ledger\u201d \u2014 every transaction is recorded publicly. \u201cAt the end of the day, bitcoin itself is a very traceable currency.

We\u2019ve spoken to leading academics and law enforcement officials. And we\u2019ve reviewed thousands of pages of documents, reports, and other materials. \u201cToday\u2019s public hearing is the next step in that inquiry. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s our expectation that the information we\u2019ve gathered in this fact-finding effort will allow us to put forward, during the course of 2014, a proposed regulatory framework for virtual currency firms operating in New York. \u201cI believe we would be the first state in the nation to do so. Clearly, when it comes to virtual currencies, regulators are in new and unchartered waters. \u201cHowever, the legal action that we saw yesterday underscores how critically important it is that we put in place guardrails for this industry to help root out money laundering and other misconduct. \u201cThe goal of these hearings is to provide a 360-degree view of this new and constantly evolving industry \u2013 both its promise and its potential pitfalls. \u201cWe\u2019ve sought to bring together a diverse group of witnesses with an array of different perspectives. \u201cWe believed that it was important to hear from law enforcement and regulators. But we also wanted to bring in investors, technologists, merchants, and a number of other individuals on the ground floor of this fledging industry to provide their views. \u201cOf course, this hearing will neither be the first nor last word on virtual currencies. \u201cBut we hope to make a positive contribution to the public dialogue on this issue as NYDFS and other regulators try to grapple with the appropriate regulatory guidelines for this industry. \u201cLet me step back then and say that our agency approaches the issue of virtual currencies without any prejudgements. A lot of people initially react to a very outside-the-box idea like virtual currencies with immediate skepticism. I think we should resist being completely overtaken by that urge. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say precisely what the future holds for virtual currency and its associated technology. Currently, there is not widespread adoption of virtual currencies among the general public. And some doubt whether there will ever be. \u201cBut the same has been said about many other technologies that have since become everyday features of our lives. \u201cIt\u2019s generally a difficult proposition for financial regulators to forecast technological trends. It\u2019s not something we do particularly well. \u201cThat said, serious people \u2013 in the technological and investment community \u2013 are taking virtual currencies seriously. They are putting significant amounts of time, attention, and capital behind them. We, as a regulator, cannot turn a blind eye to something like that. We don\u2019t really have a choice. \u201cMoreover, the Department of Financial Services \u2013 like many other state financial regulators \u2013 has a specific legal responsibility to license and regulate money transmission. And to the extent that some virtual currency service providers are engaged in money transmission, we do have an important role in writing and enforcing the rules of the game for financial firms. \u201cOur role is perhaps best described as that of a referee. We want to make sure everyone is playing by the rules and preventing misconduct, such as money laundering. But, at the same time, we also want to make sure that we don\u2019t clip the wings of a fledgling technology before it gets off the ground. We want to make certain that New York remains a hub for innovation and a magnet for new technology firms. \u201cIndeed, virtual currency could ultimately have a number of benefits for our financial system.\xa0It could force the traditional payments community to \u2018up its game\u2019 in terms of the speed, affordability, and reliability of financial transactions. \u201cI think many consumers \u2013 myself included \u2013 are perplexed that, in a world where information travels around the globe in a matter of milliseconds, it can often take several days to transfer money to a friend\u2019s bank account. \u201cMoreover, the open-source nature of this technology, relatively low (financial) barriers to entry, and nascent nature of this industry mean its constantly evolving. The virtual currency industry \u2013 as currently constituted \u2013 may or may not ultimately see wide-spread adoption among the general public. It\u2019s open for debate. There are, for example, serious questions about whether \u2013 given its volatility \u2013 it can serve as a stable source of value for transactions. \u201cBut regardless of that, there might be \u2013 at the very least \u2013 a kernel of something here that has a profound impact on the future of payments technology and the financial system. That\u2019s why we want to proceed without any prejudgements. \u201cBy the same token, however, regulators have to remain vigilant about the potential dangers that the current level of anonymity provided by virtual currencies presents for money laundering, drug-trafficking, gunrunning, and other illegal activities. \u201cNo industry should be defined entirely by its bad actors. But it\u2019s very clear that there are serious and documented dangers about the use of virtual currencies to subvert critical anti-money laundering requirements. \u201cThere are, of course, vulnerabilities and dangers associated with money laundering in the traditional financial system, such as at banks. As you may know, that\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve been particularly active at the Department of Financial Services. \u201cBut one issue that we have to consider with virtual currency firms \u2013 unlike banks or traditional money transmitters \u2013 is that there is not currently a robust regulatory regime to help spot red flags and root out illegal activity. \u201cRight now, the regulation of virtual currency industry is akin to a virtual Wild West. (There is even a modern day Gold Rush among miners in the virtual currency community.) That lack of regulation, however, is simply is not tenable for the long term. \u201cFashioning appropriate guardrails for virtual currencies presents challenging questions for regulators. Virtual currency is not easily categorized within the divisions we traditionally think about when it comes to the financial system (such as banks, insurers, or money transmitters). It\u2019s neither fish nor fowl. \u201cAnd while we want to set up clear rules of the game, we also want to preserve sufficient flexibility given the constantly evolving nature of this new technology. \u201cThat is, in part, why we\u2019re evaluating whether our agency should issue a so-called \u2018BitLicense\u2019 specifically tailored to virtual currencies. \u201cWhen people say the word money transmission, they usually think of \u2013 if anything at all \u2013 firms that were formed more than 150 years ago when our country was still exploring the western frontier. \u201cThe question, then, is what type of licensing, examination, and collateral requirements for the virtual currency industry will provide appropriate guardrails to protect consumers and our national security \u2013 without stifling beneficial innovation. \u201cThere is, we acknowledge, distrust among some in the virtual currency community about regulation. However, we believe that \u2013 for a number of reasons \u2013 putting in place appropriate regulatory safeguards for virtual currencies will be beneficial to the long-term strength of the virtual currency industry. \u201cFirst, serving as a money changer of choice for terrorists, drug smugglers, illegal weapons dealers, money launderers, and human traffickers can expose the virtual currency industry to extraordinarily serious criminal penalties. Taking steps to root out illegal activity is both a legal and business imperative for virtual currency firms. \u201cSecond, safety and soundness requirements help build greater confidence among customers that the funds that they entrust to virtual currency companies won\u2019t get caught in a virtual black hole. Indeed, some consumers have expressed concerns about how quickly their virtual currency transactions are processed. There have also been public reports of virtual currency lost \u2013 perhaps irretrievably \u2013 through hacking and other cyber security vulnerabilities. Addressing those issues through enhanced safety and soundness requirements would be important to building greater confidence in this technology among the general public and promoting wider adoption. \u201cWe look forward to a spirited discussion on all of these issues.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/01/28/bitcoin-firms-will-get-regulatory-framework-in-2014-nys-lawsky-says/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 28, 11, 38), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Firms Will Get &lsquo;Regulatory Framework&rsquo; in 2014, NY&rsquo;s Lawsky Says'}, {'articleText': u' A majority of U.S technology professionals would welcome being paid in bitcoin, according to a survey by event organizer Tech in Motion. Out of 847 responses to a questionnaire sent to Tech in Motion\u2019s 18,000 members, 51.12% answered \u201cyes, absolutely,\u201d to the question \u201cWould you be interested in being paid for your work in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?\u201d A further 18.06% ticked \u201cMaybe, let\u2019s see where Bitcoin is in a year or two,\u201d with the remainder saying that they would prefer to be paid in traditional currency. Just 9.92% rejected the option because they \u201cdo not think Bitcoin will last,\u201d and 1.18% said they didn\u2019t know what bitcoin was. The results will be encouraging to bitcoin payment processor firms, which are trying to convince U.S. payroll processors to offer crypto-currency options to their clients\u2019 employees. Bitpay is developing such a service in the U.S. and, according to Chief Executive Anthony Gallippi, is talking to various payroll processors about the prospect of signing them on to it. In Canada, payroll management firm Wagepoint already has partnered with Canadian virtual exchange VirtEx to integrate bitcoin options into its services. Payroll is seen by bitcoin advocates as a powerful driver of bitcoin adoption in the future. Obtaining the digital currency is currently cumbersome and inefficient, partly because exchanges and brokers have struggled to establish solid relationships with traditional banks to allow their customers to easily exchange dollars and other fiat currency into bitcoin. They say an expansion of bitcoin wage payments\u2013even if employees opt to receive only a small portion of their income this way\u2013would create a more seamless way for people to acquire and start using the crypto-currency, delivering it the same way they have always received their dollars. That the tech community would be most in favor of this is consistent with other trends. Many bitcoin enthusiasts have math and computer-science backgrounds. IT professionals are most likely to be familiar with the workings of the bitcoin software protocol, its system for \u201cmining\u201d coins into existence via machines that solve complex computation problems, and the appeal of its decentralized model for verifying transactions on a universal ledger known as the bitcoin blockchain. It\u2019s possible that the most enthusiastic bitcoin supporters were the most motivated to respond to the Tech in Motion survey, which would have skewed the results. But according to data provided by the PR agency Shift Communications, the membership covers a fairly wide cross-section of IT firms, including software developers, open-source developers, IT infrastructure producers, and hardware and mobile product developers. Shift senior account executive David Hefferman also noted that Tech in Motion has \u201cdone some rough polling in each city [where its members are based] and the numbers are fairly consistent.\u201d \u2013 Follow Michael J.

That simple change in search engine results shows that the world was starting to dissociate bitcoin from this single high-profile, reputation-damaging case and instead of focusing on bitcoin\u2019s positives, Mr. Farber said. Maybe he spoke too soon. Two arrests announced by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara Monday morning \u2013 including if BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem, one of the most high-profile bitcoin evangelists \u2014 put the bitcoin/Silk Road association back into public consciousness. Mr. Shrem and bitcoin trader , Robert Faiella are charged with allowing Silk Road dealers to launder money through bitcoin transactions. This is a kick in the teeth for the attendees at that Miami event \u2013 nearly all of them fervent believers in the revolutionary benefits of peer-to-peer crypto-currencies. The arrests will be seen as a setback for efforts to convince government agencies to impose sensible regulation that encourages the growth of the nascent technology rather than stifling it. It will also make it harder for bank compliance officers to feel confident they can deal with bitcoin-related businesses. One comment, in particular, from an Internal Revenue Service agent quoted in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s complaint, will send chills up bitcoiners\u2019 spines: \u201cBitcoins are not inherently illegal and have known legitimate uses, but they are also known to be used to facilitate illicit transactions and to launder criminal proceeds, given the ease with which the can be used to move money anonymously,\u201d the agent said. Speaking Monday reflecting on his Sunday remarks, Mr. Farber said it was disappointing that one case continues to obscure the remarkable technological developments that the bitcoin community is delivering in liberating financial payments around the world. \u201cYou go to these events and there is so much innovation and so many people trying to do good things. It\u2019s all positive, but that\u2019s not what gets the attention,\u201d he said. Mr. Shrem is being represented by Keith Miller, a partner of Mr. Farber\u2019s at Perkins Coie. Indeed, those remarkable innovations were presented in great detail at the Miami conference. Up 4,600% from its level a year ago, according to Coindesk\u2019s index of three exchanges, bitcoin\u2019s market cap is now estimated at $12 billion. That\u2019s created a pool of newly rich bitcoin holders who are eager to buy stuff with it\u2014or in many cases, make donations with it. One speaker at the Miami event, Jason King, is renowned for his success in raising money through bitcoin for Sean\u2019s Outpost, a Pensacola, Fl. homeless outreach service in named after Mr. King\u2019s murdered best friend. Toward the end of the conference, Mr. King announced he would run an \u201cultra-marathon\u201d from Miami to San Francisco to raise bitcoin donations with the aid of a specially equipped RV that will accompany him on the journey. Meanwhile, adoption by merchants is growing exponentially. High-profile names in the U.S. are adding to the buzz \u2014 from gaming service Zynga to the Sacramento Kings basketball team. Bitcoin payments processor Bitpay has increased its customer base from 2,000 merchants a year ago to 21,000, and has now handled more than 200,000 transactions worth a total of $107 million. On the consumer side, Blockchain.info has surpassed one million bitcoin wallets, tools with which its customers store and spend bitcoin, and popular U.S. bitcoin broker Coinbase\u2019s wallet count is above 850,000. The reason for the growth, says Bitpay CEO Anthony Gallippi: Bitcoin transactions carry almost no fees, compared with 2% to 3% merchant fees from credit cards, and they don\u2019t require the divulgence of private information to third parties. Making an unsubtle dig at the security breach that Target suffered, Mr. Gallippi chuckled as he showed his audience a slide bearing the retailer\u2019s logo and said merchants wanted bitcoin because they \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be a TARGET of identity theft.\u201d Payment fraud in the traditional payments system, Mr. Gallippi said, was worth $100 billion a year globally. Yet as much as the Bitpay chief and other speakers implored people to trumpet bitcoin\u2019s comparatively safer and cheaper qualities, the headlines today are all about Silk Road. Asked Monday about the arrests and Mr. Shrem\u2019s absence from the Miami conference, at which he was billed as a top-line speaker, organizer Moe Levin capture the attendees\u2019 frustration over that turn of events. \u201cIn order to have a truly revolutionary future, we must go through some unfortunate growing pains,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cPlease don\u2019t allow sensationalism to trump inspiration.\u201d \u2013 Follow Michael J.

The revelers were in a festive mood. And why not? They had gathered for a weekend conference at the Miami Beach Convention Center to discuss the latest developments in crypto currencies. Coming off a remarkable year in which interest in the digital currency surged along with its price, the Miami event seemed as much a let-your-hair-down celebration as a talkfest. This was a crowd confident that their nascent, disruptive industry\u2019s moment had come. They believed fervently that they were part of a revolution to transform the global financial system. What\u2019s more, many of them had just become fabulously wealthy. Miami provided the ideal setting for a bitcoin coming-of-age party. Members of the city\u2019s bitcoin community had been talking it up as a potential hub for digital-currency remittance transfers to Latin America. Payment processor Bitpay had set up the Clevelander and other Miami Beach businesses to allow attendees to pay for their rooms, drinks, burgers, car rides and other South Beach services in the same fashion. It was all part of what CEO Tony Gallippi described as his attempt to \u201corganize a self-contained bitcoin economy around the conference.\u201d Organizers had predicted a turnout of around 500 early last week. By the end of Friday, 1,200 had signed up. The audience, comprised almost entirely of bitcoin true-believers, reveled Saturday in bold 2014 predictions from the who\u2019s who of the crypto-currency world. They heard Matthew Roszak, a co-founder of Silk Road Equity (unaffiliated with the now defunct illicit drug-trading site of the same name) forecast that the amount of venture capital funds dedicated to the industry would rise from $100 million to $500 million as venture capitalists had their \u201cwake-up-and-smell-the-bitcoin moment.\u201d They were wowed by lofty talk about \u201cBitcoin 2.0,\u201d a revolutionary future of peer-to-peer transactions, without meddling middlemen, in everything from gambling and real estate purchases to Internet services and stock issuance. And they cheered heartily when Roger Ver, a serial investor in bitcoin projects known affectionately as \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d for his habit of making large, bitcoin-based charitable donations, declared that bitcoin is a \u201clever with which to move the world in a more peaceful direction.\u201d Not every speaker painted a clear-skies picture, however. On Sunday, a panel of lawyers urged the bitcoin community to work hard to remove the negative connotations associated with the FBI\u2019s recent seizure of bitcoin held by the Silk Road illicit drug-trading site. (It hasn\u2019t helped that on Monday Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara announced the arrest of two men, including prominent bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem, on charges of assisting Silk Road customers launder money through bitcoin exchanges.) And in less serious ways, the conference offered other reminders that bitcoin is still a very new new thing \u2013 with all the challenges that go along with that. Overwhelmed by the turnout, organizers had to make do with hand-written badges when the printed ones ran out. No sit-down lunch was provided, so attendees purchased pre-made sandwiches and salads from the center\u2019s caf\xe9 and sat on the floor to eat. A room that was intended for the press contingent was double-booked by a team of documentary filmmakers, which meant a planned press conference by one Bitcoin 2.0 startup was cancelled. But Moe Levin, an Amsterdam-based event organizer, says such organizational challenges were \u201ca great problem to have.\u201d \u201cAs things grow in the bitcoin community, there is an incredible amount of work put on by a very few select people,\u201d he said gesturing at promoters\u2019 booths staffed by the same programmers who are building a proliferation of bitcoin-connected products. \u201cProjects that would or should take teams of thousands are being done by ten developers all day every day. The same holds true for a bitcoin conference. \u201cThe global community is becoming really united,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, like the price gain, it\u2019s happening much faster than people could imagine.\u201d \u2013 Follow Michael J.

The crypto-currency came out of seemingly nowhere, and before anybody knew it, it was the talk of the digital town. But as regulators and business types start to take it seriously, they are going to present bitcoin with its first real challenges on its way to becoming a revolutionary-type transformative technology. \u201cThe story is about to change,\u201d Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist at ConvergEx, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \u201cIn thinking through a framework to interpret what will be an eventful 2014 for bitcoin, here are the three points \u2013 we\u2019ll call them Bitcoin Buckets for a touch of alliterative flair \u2013 to guide the discussion.\u201d The \u201cbuckets,\u201d as he called them, are the three key shoals the currency will have to navigate as it expands: regulation, adoption, and volatility. \u201cSince those little Lydian coins in 600 BC, issuing currency has largely been the domain of governments,\u201d he wrote, and while the U. S. has a history of private currencies before the creation of the Federal Reserve, the fact is that in the modern world, governments control currencies. Until bitcoin. Initially, Mr. Colas noted, the prevailing fear was that governments would just squash it. Instead, there seems to be a growing awareness among government types \u2014 Jacob Lew\u2019s Davos comments notwithstanding \u2014 that bitcoin offers some value to the world. It will be important to see how government bodies choose to address bitcoin. There is a key meeting next week, when the New York State Department of Financial Services convenes a hearing on it, and the early buzz, he said, \u201clooks promising.\u201d Mr. Colas sees this playing out not as a bitcoin vs. the dollar story, or any other government currency, but as a bitcoin vs. the banks story. \u201cBitcoin really isn\u2019t competition for national currencies \u2013 at least not for quite a while.\xa0 It can be competition here-and-now for national banking systems.\u201d The other two buckets, adoption and volatility, are more self-explanatory. Every single day, emails come into our inbox here at MoneyBeat pitching another retailer or outlet that is taking bitcoin, as diverse as the nonprofit Junior Achievement of New York and online retailer TigerDirect.com. There will, of course, be more. \u201cThe bottom line is that bitcoin adoption by merchants is just going to accelerate,\u201d he said. The last, volatility, should be obvious to anyone even remotely familiar with bitcoin, which last year traded in a band between $10 and $1,200, with frequent wild surges and violent plunges. This year will have to bring some stability to the price if it\u2019s going to move into the mainstream. Right now it is far too volatile for fundamentally minded investors and users. \u201cTo succeed as a method of wealth transfer \u2013 which we believe to be the cornerstone of bitcoin\u2019s long term success \u2013 price volatility will have to decline.\u201d Ultimately, Mr. Colas thinks bitcoin has a future. \u201cWhat does seem more certain is that bitcoin is a very important disruptive technology in financial circles.\xa0 If it were a private, venture backed enterprise, it would certainly be worth more than the latest mobile picture app or video game platform.\xa0 Which puts that $10 billion total valuation in some context.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/01/24/bitcoins-three-key-challenges-in-2014/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 24, 13, 4), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin&rsquo;s Three Key Challenges in 2014'}, {'articleText': u' Jamie Dimon isn\u2019t very impressed by bitcoin.

That in itself is interesting. But J.P. Morgan Jamie Dimon and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew were both asked their opinions and both talked it down, and both harped on its use in drug trafficking.

But that\u2019s kind of the whole point of bitcoin, he said, that it makes moving money electronically easier for anybody using the system, whether or not they\u2019re doing anything illegal. It\u2019s worth pointing out, too, that banks themselves have gotten into trouble for their role facilitating money laundering. HSBC in December pleaded guilty to allowing millions of dollars of Mexican and Colombia drug cartel money to be laundered through its banks, and since 2006 more than a dozen other banks have settled similar charges.

Mr. Greebel would not speculate on when the ETF might be approved or launched. But once that happens, it should enhance the trading environment for bitcoin, which has until now been extremely volatile, he said. \u201cThe ETF brings the ability to buy an interest or a security [in the virtual currency] without having to buy the underlying bitcoin,\u201d which he said would remove logistical and legal barriers for many investors currently unable to participate in the market. At the same time, he said, the ETF should help the development of a large, institutional exchange for bitcoin to complement the offerings that currently exist from retail-focused platforms. The authorized participants who construct the ETF will need to buy bitcoin, he said, \u201cso, having a national level, U.S.-regulated exchange will facilitate that.\u201d At the same time, the ETF will make it easier for institutions to take short positions against bitcoin as it will be \u201copen to full arbitrage opportunities,\u201d which would also help smooth out some of the volatility in the underlying market. Regulation, he said, is therefore welcome. \u201cAmbiguity is the worst thing,\u201d Mr. Greebel said, noting that it\u2019s one of the factors that\u2019s keeping institutional investors away and that\u2019s making banks reluctant to provide accounts to businesses operating in the bitcoin industry. He said the Trust is making the case that bitcoin \u2013 often referred to as a digital currency \u2013 should be treated as a capital asset rather than, say, a currency or a commodity. That means bitcoin investments should be subject to capital gains taxes. Although some of the early enthusiasts for bitcoin might be put off by the arrival of a taxation regime, big institutions will welcome clarity on the taxation status for the new technology, Mr. Greebel said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/mikejcasey', 'name': 'Michael J.

Casey and Paul Vigna You can\u2019t get much more mainstream than professional American sports. In that sense, Thursday\u2019s news that the Sacramento Kings basketball team will let its fans use bitcoin to purchase tickets, jerseys, hot dogs and anything else from its selection of products may go down as a key moment in the digital currency\u2019s coming of age. But this is only the latest in a steady progression of vendors choosing to transact in bitcoin, a group that is at the vanguard of the digital currency\u2019s bid for legitimacy. There are now tens of thousands of merchants around the world accepting bitcoin. Merchant processor Bitpay now has more 20,000 separate clients and says that at its current rate of growth it will hit 100,000 by year end. So, even though bitcoin might not yet have truly earned mainstream status, there\u2019s already a lot you can do with it. Here are some of things that your bitcoin will buy: Cars.\xa0In December, a Lamborghini dealership in Costa Mesla, Calif., sold a Tesla Model S to a customer who offered to pay for it with bitcoin. It was fitting: An all-electric vehicle, marketed with a rebellious, disruptive business model, purchased with a currency that\u2019s seen as the ultimate disruptor to the old ways of doing business. A Hamptons home.\xa0If you\u2019re in the market for a pad in Southampton, N.Y., and you\u2019ve got $800,000 worth of bitcoin, we\u2019ve got a nice four-bedroom ranch-style house for you.\xa0Philipp Preuss is selling his home and is accepting bitcoin. The home, which went on the market in October, is still for sale, and Mr. Preuss is still holding firm to his selling price. A college education.\xa0The University of Nicosia, located in the capital of Cyprus, began accepting bitcoin in November for all purchases, from books to tuition (they do a lively business in distance learning). It\u2019s perhaps no surprise that the crisis-wracked Mediterranean country is the site for this innovation. When its desperate government slapped a tax on bank deposits, bitcoin prices spiked as pundits speculated that fears of government confiscation would provide a valuable advertisement for the digital currency\u2019s protections from such actions. Anything for your wardrobe or home that Overstock sells. On the first day it started providing for bitcoin-based purchases, Overstock did $130,000 in the digital currency. Overstock\u2019s CEO Patrick Byrne has become something of a libertarian evangelist for bitcoin, which he says he is drawn to because \u201cno government mandarin can create [it] with the stroke of a pen,\u201d Online games. When Zynga announced that customers at its Zynga.com site could use bitcoin for certain transactions, it became possible to buy a virtual tractor for your virtual farm with a virtual currency. A daiquiri, or six. The Clevelander Hotel, famous for raucous pool parties on Miami\u2019s South Beach, has opened itself up to bitcoin payments when hundreds of crypto-currency enthusiasts and revelers descend on Miami for the North American Bitcoin Conference. A chamomile sour. Or any other drink that house mixologist Orson Salicetti can dream up at the upscale \u201cgastro-lounge\u201d EVR in midtown Manhattan. Charlie Shrem, the twenty-something owner, is a bitcoin evangelist, and can often be found at EVR handling one of his bitcoin-related businesses. Brooklyn Pizza. If you\u2019re looking for pizza in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y., and have bitcoin in your {digital) wallet, stop in at Lean Crust Pizza. Store owner Daniel Lee is a bitcoiner, and two of his other businesses in the borough \u2014 Greene Ave. Market and Oxford Kitchen \u2014 also take bitcoin. A blog. WordPress, the firm whose easy-to-use blogging software has turned millions of people into self-employed writers and which has helped to revolutionize journalism, has joined the digital currency revolution. The way WordPress tells it, accepting bitcoin payments is all about living up to its promise to make the publishing business \u201cdemocratic.\u201d Gold. Buy a hard currency with a virtual currency. There\u2019s a reason bitcoin is often compared to gold; both have fans who buy them because they\u2019re looking for a store of value that can\u2019t be debased by profligate governments. Nothing says \u201cstore of value\u201d quite like precious metals, and nothing says \u201cI don\u2019t trust fiat currencies\u201d like bitcoin.\xa0One online seller serves both markets.\xa0Amagi Metals\xa0sells gold, silver, and platinum bullion and even does a trade in exchanging old paper currencies \u2014 and they take bitcoin. Pirated movies and music. Bitcoin has attracted a relatively notorious reputation for being a funnel for all manner of illegal activities, from ponzi schemes to drug bazaars. So it\u2019s no wonder that\xa0The Pirate Bay, the online\xa0bittorrent site that has everything from movies to music to software available for free \u2014 and illegal \u2014 download, accepts bitcoin. A trip to outer space. If you can come up with the $250,000 (291 bitcoin) fare, you can book a trip on Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic space tourism service. As of November, the service had already had one bitcoin-paying customer, a Hawaiian. Asked why he decided to allow such transactions, Mr. Branson replied, \u201cWhy not?\u201d Bitcoin, he said, is \u201cdriving a revolution\u201d Personalized vinyl decals. Or laser engraved gifts. Or a myriad of other crafts and clothes at Etsy. The online art and crafts bazaar, which allows artists of all stripes to sell their wares online, offers bitcoin as a payment method, although it\u2019s up to the individual merchants to decide whether they want to accept the crypto-currency.\xa0Memoryengravers\xa0and\xa0Azurerocket Designs Studio\xa0are two that do. Love. Online dating site OKCupid takes bitcoin. In fact, the dating site, which caters to girls who like guys, guys who like girls, guys who like guys, girls who like girls, and girls and guys who like guys and girls, can also find you a girl or a guy who likes bitcoin.

That didn\u2019t eventuate, of course.

Hotel guests will have the bitcoin deposited into their online bitcoin wallets. The amount they receive will vary depending on an in-house algorithm that PointsHound uses to translate the value of the traditional loyalty reward points into the digital currency. It will vary according to the status of different hotel rooms and users, but at current exchange rates the firm calculates that a \u201cLevel 3\u201d frequent PointsHound user could right now earn as much as 0.26 bitcoin for a three-night stay at a top-end New York Hotel.

The rapper \u2014 that would be Kanye West \u2014 has officially filed a lawsuit against Coinye \u2014 that would be the bitcoin-like electronic currency that started out as something of a joke before taking on a life of its own. Mr. West filed suit in Manhattan federal court, seeking to stop the currency from ever launching as well as unspecified damages. It appears that the anonymous Coinye founders have already backed down.\xa0Currently, the\xa0website for coinye\xa0has only this message: \u201cCoinye is dead. You win, Kanye.\u201d The coin\u2019s Twitter feed seems to confirm that as well: #BLAMEKANYE Coinye devs have dispersed. New ownership, better things coming. http://t.co/2y72eLN6Ir \u2014 Coinye (@CoinyeCoins) January 14, 2014 They were not immediately available for comment. Coinye never seemed like a serious endeavor from the start, but it points to the almost limitless potential for alternative currencies now that bitcoin has become a phenomenon. Bitcoin was launched in 2009, and last year its profile grew exponentially. After starting the year off below $20, its value skyrocketed, bolstered by some real world events: the never-ending U.S. government squabbling and eventual partial shutdown, the financial crisis in Cyprus, with the threat of depositors assets being seized, and the grudging acceptance from governments in the U.S. and China (China has since cooled on the idea). The question, though, is if bitcoin \u2014 an electronic, decentralized, alternative currency that isn\u2019t backed by any bank or government but instead a far-flung community of users \u2014 can have credence and acceptance, what\u2019s to stop anybody else from creating their own alternative virtual currency? The answer is nothing, and there have been a number of them, from ones that seem serious like litecoin to ones that seem downright silly, like dogecoin and coinye. Mr. West, whose sense of humor was\xa0infamously parodied on the TV show \u201cSouth Park,\u201d hasn\u2019t liked Coinye from the start. The currency started getting attention in early January, and Mr. West filed cease-and-desist orders on Jan. 6. The currency\u2019s originators were initially defiant. They slightly altered the name, hoping to get around the order, and moved their servers to India. For good measure, they also changed the logo: from a likeness of Mr. West to a likeness of Mr. West as a fish, a play on the \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode (you have to see it to get the joke). Presumably Mr. West (who did give \u201cSouth Park\u201d credit for the spoof) wasn\u2019t amused by that, either.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/01/14/kanye-takes-coinye-to-court-and-coinye-backs-down/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 14, 16, 1), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Kanye Takes Coinye to Court, and Coinye Backs Down'}, {'articleText': u' Some day in the far off future, when we\u2019ve all got chips implanted in our temples and synced to our Google glasses, Justin Beiber is running for president and \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d is beginning its 29th apocalyptic season, we imagine bitcoin will be boring. Just another thing, a thing that most people don\u2019t even think about anymore. Boring may not seem like much of a goal, but it is for a currency, especially a new, radical, alternative, currently exciting one like bitcoin.\xa0Because when bitcoin becomes boring, that means it will have integrated itself into daily life. The alternative currency briefly spiked up over $1,000 over the weekend, at least on Mt. Gox\u2019s exchange, after Overstock started accepting bitcoin as a payment option (with\xa0CEO Patrick Byrne predicting that Amazon will follow soon enough). Since running up to more than $1,200 in 2013 \u2014 after starting out below $20 \u2014 it\u2019s been more or less range bound (\u201crange bound\u201d for bitcoin, mind you, is a very wide range.) On Monday it was trading around $900. The spike in prices, though, is benefiting only a small group, Steven Englander,\xa0global head of G10 strategy at Citi,\xa0wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThe distribution of bitcoin holdings looks much like the distribution of wealth in North Korea and makes China\u2019s and even the U.S.\u2019 wealth distribution look like that of a workers\u2019 paradise,\u201d he wrote in a weekend note to clients. In the early days of bitcoin, people got it by \u201cmining\u201d for it, essentially turning their computers to the task of extracting and solving math equations from the algorithm that\u2019s at the heart of bitcoin. As more people got involved, the equations got increasingly harder (a feature of the system to control the level of mining). \xa0Those early adopters thus had, and continue to have, a huge advantage in terms of the price. Mr. Englander (citing other sources) estimated that 1% of bitcoin holders are sitting on 80% of the total value. In that case, bitcoin has \u201cseignorage\u201d like any other asset, he argues, and while that can create some serious imbalances, it also could produce some social good: if those early holders are driven to encourage bitcoin\u2019s use, even for their own profit, it could drive wider adoption of bitcoin, and that\u2019s where it becomes relevant, he thinks. \u201cWe are less excited about Bitcoin as a store of value and alternative to fiat currencies than about its potential use in facilitating transaction and improving payments efficiency,\u201d Mr. Englander wrote. This is similar to what we\u2019ve been saying for some time, that bitcoin\u2019s value lies more in its ability to be a mundane facility for people\u2019s daily needs than some spectacular modern gold rush. \u201cNet, net, we like small-\u2018b\u2019 generic bitcoin as a payments technology more than big-\u2018B\u2019 brand-name Bitcoin as a store of value,\u201d he wrote. The idea of bitcoin as a payments system is gaining steam. Overstock\u2019s Mr. Byrne noted, importantly, that the company isn\u2019t keeping payments it receives in bitcoin as bitcoin. It\u2019s converting that into dollars. Because his suppliers aren\u2019t using bitcoin, there\u2019s no reason for him to hold onto them, he said. So, in essence, what Overstock is doing is using it only as a payments system, like, say, PayPal. That isn\u2019t to denigrate bitcoin (or PayPal, for that matter). As 2014 progresses, this will be where bitcoin developments get interesting, not the price movement. In fact, Lightspeed Venture\u2019s Maninder Gulati thinks\xa0bitcoin will evolve beyond being just a store of value or payments system in 2014. We\u2019ve heard similar predictions from others; that what\u2019s really important is the underlying protocol, and as bitcoin develops, more entrepreneurs will come up with ways to use it that are beyond mere currency. And that\u2019s when things will get exciting. One of Mr. Gulati\u2019s other interesting predictions is that this year will see the advent of an interface that brings bitcoin to the masses in the same way Netscape\u2019s browser brought the Internet to the masses in the 1990s. \u201cIt is still very difficult for the average \u2018Joe\u2019 to understand, acquire, store and use bitcoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHence, what a \u2018browser\u2019 did to the Internet, a product or technology innovation will do it to bitcoin in 2014.\u201d Citi\u2019s Mr. Englander, in fact, sees a path in which alternative currencies become accepted as an asset class, and possibly even absorbed into the existing system. \u201cBusinesses are likely to prefer whichever payments system gives the best combination of safety, security and stability. They are likely to be indifferent whether these characteristics will be found inside or outside the conventional financial system or whether the preferred vehicle is the original bitcoin, a bitcoin lookalike, or USD-coin that makes transacting easier.\u201d A bitcoin greenback?

For that, bitcoin owners can partly thank online gaming company, Zynga, whose quiet announcement over the weekend that it is testing a system to allow players of certain online games to purchase items with bitcoin was portrayed as a vote of confidence in the digital currency. Coming after online retailer Overstock.com last month outlined plans to allow customers to transact in bitcoin later this year, the Zynga development adds another small piece to a payment network that needs to grow if the virtual currency is to become an accepted unit of exchange and a store of value. But while there\u2019s no denying the PR benefits to bitcoin from brand-name merchants getting involved, it\u2019s important to appreciate the limits to what they are doing. The fact is that virtually all businesses that accept bitcoin are severely limiting their exposure to the currency\u2019s volatile valuations. (Thanks in part to the Zynga news, that volatility has been on display these past few days: Bitcoin was last quoted at $952.86, according to an aggregated bitcoin price index provided by Coindesk, but was as high as $1,023.17 earlier Monday and as low as $829.85 at its close on Friday.) That merchants are seeking to protect themselves from this volatility doesn\u2019t mean gains aren\u2019t made in terms of network effects every time a retailer signs up to increase the shopping options for bitcoin owners. But their understandable caution is also a reminder of how far bitcoin needs to go to earn true \u201ccurrency\u201d status. Consider the low-fanfare Zynga announcement, which came via a short post on a Reddit bitcoin forum Saturday. It is restricting the bitcoin purchases option to \u201cselect\u201d web games on Zynga.com, which means it won\u2019t be available via third-party platforms such as Facebook, the most popular platform for Zynga games. By using a low-profile publicity strategy to announce it was \u201cconducting a Bitcoin test,\u201d Zynga signaled the low-scale nature of its plans, which cover only \u201cin-game purchases\u201d of low-cost items for virtual-world games such as Farmville 2, Castleville and Chefville. It seemed as much designed to seek feedback from users and, presumably, to generate buzz around Zynga as anything else. Most important, Zynga is conducting its test with the help of bitcoin payments processor Bitpay, which now has 12,000 merchants using its service. Bitpay sets up transactions so that merchants are entirely remunerated in their local currency and face no exchange-rate risk. As an announcer explains in an introductory video pitch to merchants on the Bitpay website, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to know what the heck a bitcoin is. You are also completely insulated from the bitcoin exchange rate.\u201d In this context, news reports stating that \u201cXYZ merchant is now accepting bitcoin\u201d need to be taken with a grain of salt. That said, the Overstock.com development is potentially more significant. The firm is on track to post revenue of more than $1.3 billion for 2013. If a sizable enough portion of that went to bitcoin, the Bitpay platform may not have the capacity to handle it. Yet Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne, who sees bitcoin aligning with his philosophical interest in developing a non-fiat currencies that \u201cno government mandarin can create with the stroke of a pen,\u201d isn\u2019t fazed. He says there are ways to reduce exposure to exchange-rate fluctuations down to 15-minute periods and is exploring other means of reducing risk, including end-of-day currency clearing and, eventually, bitcoin derivatives. He expects the market for such hedging instruments to \u201cget thicker and to greatly feed on itself.\u201d Mr. Byrne adds that he will consider holding bitcoin for Overstock\u2019s own account if enough of its suppliers start accepting the digital currency. So far the only conversations he has had on that are with Chinese suppliers, who he says were enthusiastic until the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s recent moves to block purchases of bitcoin. For now, such statements work to further bitcoin\u2019s cause by building buzz and interest rather than significantly advancing its level of adoption. That\u2019s not to say announcements such as Zynga\u2019s and Overstock\u2019s don\u2019t provide a useful way for entrepreneurs in the fledgling bitcoin industry to generate interest in their products. After Anthony Di Iorio, a co-founder of bitcoin wallet provider KryptoKit, posted a video showing how he purchased a Zynga item, a discussion ensued on Reddit about how easily the transaction was made, how the user provided no personal information to Zynga, and about the low transaction costs involved. At last count, the video had 6,432 views. The buzz is likely to continue around bitcoin. But until a major merchant starts accepting bitcoin for its own account, adoption is likely to be a gradual, incremental process. \u2013 Follow Michael J.

ATM users can either buy or sell bitcoin through the machines. Taiwan is not alone in dodging the newfangled bitcoin frenzy. Governments and banks around the world are worried that the absence of scrutiny over bitcoin\u2014which isn\u2019t issued or backed by a central government but is created through a sophisticated computer process\u2014could be a hotbed for money laundering or other illegal activities. China\u2019s central bank last month asked some domestic payment processors to stop trading with the country\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange, BTC China. The move sent the virtual currency\u2019s value plunging by as much as 38% against the dollar at the time.

By law, a fiduciary\u2014like a doctor or a lawyer\u2014must act in the best interests of his client and seek to avoid all material conflicts of interest. Investment advisers are required to act as fiduciaries, but stockbrokers and insurance agents generally aren\u2019t\u2014yet. As early as October, the U.S. Department of Labor is expected to propose new rules that would ensure that brokers and other securities professionals would act solely for the benefit of their clients when advising on individual retirement accounts. Those assets are a giant honey pot, with $5.41 trillion in IRAs, according to the Federal Reserve. 9. Berkshire\u2019s Tracy Britt Brings CEOs Together\nBy Anupreeta Das\nJune 12 Warren Buffett is famously hands-off when it comes to running the subsidiary businesses of Berkshire Hathaway, but some Berkshire CEOs have been craving a little more contact \u2013 at least with each other. Buffett\u2019s financial assistant Tracy Britt is making it happen. The 28-year-old Harvard MBA has worked by the legendary investor\u2019s side since 2009, and is taking on more responsibility within Berkshire, including the chairmanship of four of its subsidiaries. One of her goals is to increase interaction among the managers of Berkshire\u2019s 80-odd businesses. She travels frequently to the far-flung units to visit Berkshire executives and learn about their business challenges and practices, often using that knowledge to put CEOs in touch with each other. 8. Apple Shares Are Dirt Cheap; So What?\nBy Steven Russolillo\nApril 18 Apple Inc. shares haven\u2019t been this cheap in at least 10 years. Investors don\u2019t care. The steep plunge in Apple\u2019s stock price over the past seven months got us wondering: When it will become attractive enough for bargain hunters to start scooping up more shares and bump the price higher? Worries about slowing growth and increasing competition have sent the stock down by more than 40% since it peaked above $700 in September. Shares are now trading at 9.08 times projected earnings for the next 12 months, according to FactSet, the lowest level in at least 10 years. Price-to-earnings ratios are calculated by taking a stock\u2019s price and dividing it by the company\u2019s earnings per share. 7. Madoff Five Years Later: Where Are Some of the Key Players Now?\nBy WSJ Staff\nDec. 10 Five years after Bernard L. Madoff\u2019s massive Ponzi scheme was unveiled, here\u2019s a look at what several of his family members, employees and investors are up to now. The post recounts how their lives were forever altered by the biggest financial fraud in history. 6. Apple Loses Throne as World\u2019s Biggest Company\nBy Steven Russolillo\nApril 17 Apple Inc. is no longer on top. Wednesday\u2019s steep slide in Apple\u2019s shares has pushed the tech giant to second place on the list of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Oil giant Exxon Mobil has reclaimed the throne. As the chart shows, both companies have been jockeying back and forth for the top spot for much of 2013. Prior to that, Apple had been the clear-cut king from January 2012 through this past January. And before that, Exxon had been the king dating back to 2006. 5. Detroit\u2019s Bankruptcy: 40% of Street Lights Don\u2019t Work, 66% of Ambulances Out of Service\nBy Mike Cherney\nJuly 18 Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy petition paints a bleak picture for the Motor City: more than 100,000 creditors, more than $18 billion in accrued obligations and a homicide rate that is at its highest level in nearly 40 years. Detroit filed for bankruptcy protection Thursday afternoon, becoming the largest ever municipal bankruptcy case. It becomes the latest in a small but high-profile list of municipalities to file after the recession. The cities of Stockton and San Bernardino in California filed last summer and Jefferson County, Ala., did so in November 2011. 4. Stocks Plunge, Quickly Recover, on Fake Tweet\nBy Paul Vigna\nApril 23 The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged within minutes early this afternoon, after somebody hacked an AP Twitter account and posted a bogus tweet saying the White House had been attacked. The Dow, which had been up about 130 points, fell into the red within two minutes, and then bounced back just as quickly as it became obvious that the \u201cnews\u201d was false, and a prank. Here, for your edification, is a screenshot of the fake tweet. White House spokesman Jay Carney quickly got on the air and dismissed the story. \u201cThe president is fine,\u201d Carney said. \u201cI was just with him.\u201d 3. Meet the Man Who Has Worked at Goldman for 80 Years\nBy Justin Baer\nJuly 12 One day into his job at Goldman Sachs, Alfred Feld found his name on a list of employees the firm had targeted for layoffs. Then fate, and a supportive boss, intervened. Eighty years later, Mr. Feld is still at it at Goldman. \u201cI came so close to being fired after one day,\u201d Mr. Feld, 98 years old, said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m glad that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d UPDATE: Mr. Feld passed away on Nov. 25. 2. The Intelligent Investor: Saving Investors From Themselves\nBy Jason Zweig\nJune 28 I was once asked, at a journalism conference, how I defined my job. I said: My job is to write the exact same thing between 50 and 100 times a year in such a way that neither my editors nor my readers will ever think I am repeating myself. That\u2019s because good advice rarely changes, while markets change constantly. The temptation to pander is almost irresistible. And while people need good advice, what they want is advice that sounds good. 1.\xa0Wall Street Gives Apple\u2019s New iPhones Thumbs Down\nBy Steven Russolillo\nSept. 11 Wall Street\u2019s initial reviews on Apple Inc.\u2019s new iPhones and the company\u2019s pricing strategy are far from favorable. At least three strategists downgraded their investment ratings on Apple Wednesday morning in the aftermath of the company\u2019s latest product launch. Shares fell as much as 6% to $464.81 minutes after the opening bell. Through Tuesday\u2019s close, the stock had been up 25% since the end of June. Still, it remains a far cry from its record high above $700 in September. Apple introduced a pair of new iPhones with upgraded features, but didn\u2019t stray from its usual playbook, a strategy that has sparked concerns amid growing competition from the likes of Samsung Electronics Co. and handset makers using Google Android software.

You can buy a Tesla with bitcoin. You can pay for\xa0college classes with bitcoin. There\u2019s a guy out on Long Island who will sell you his house in bitcoin. You can buy companies, too. Earlier this week, ZeroBlock, which publishes a bitcoin-related mobile app of the same name, sold itself to Blockchain.info, which operates a popular bitcoin \u201cwallet.\u201d What really caught our eye is that the transaction \u2014 the purchase price was not disclosed \u2014 was handled entirely in bitcoin, according to one of ZeroBlock\u2019s two founders, Dan Held. The announcement was made on Christmas Eve. \u201cIt was a very nice Christmas present,\u201d Mr. Held said. Mr. Held and his business partner, Kevin Johnson, sold all of the assets and intellectual property to Blockchain. They kept the legal entity ZeroBlock LLC to themselves. While it was essentially a cash transaction, the cash in question was bitcoin. As we\u2019ve said before, to us the future of bitcoin doesn\u2019t lie in its wildly fluctuating exchange rates, but in its utility as a means of exchange, as a payments system, as something as mundane and boring \u2014 and stable and utilitarian \u2014 as a dollar bill. It certainly isn\u2019t surprising that players in the bitcoin world would use the currency in their transactions \u2013 it might be more surprising if they didn\u2019t use bitcoin. However, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the transaction was handled using the crypto-currency, and while it\u2019s not the first deal done in bitcoin, it does serve to illustrate that these kinds of deals can be done. Quite easily, according to Mr. Held. \u201cUsing bitcoin was much easier than wiring the funds through traditional means,\u201d Mr. Held told MoneyBeat in an email. \u201cIt only took about 20 seconds to get confirmation.\u201d They used the U.S. dollar pricing on bitstamp to determine the execution price, he said. Both Mr. Held and Mr. Johnson converted a portion of their earnings into U.S. dollars to handle tax liabilities. ZeroBlock is an app that launched in the spring that collects and displays bitcoin price quotes from the various exchanges. It also has some graphs, links to stories on reddit and elsewhere, a currency translator, and push notifications (full disclosure: we here at MoneyBeat have been using it since summer, when we first read about it). ZeroBlock, according to Mr. Held, is \u201cthe most reviewed and highest rated bitcoin app in the iOS app store.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/26/doing-ma-with-bitcoin-blockchain-buys-zeroblock-app/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 26, 15, 43), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Doing M&amp;A With &ndash; And In &ndash; Bitcoin: Blockchain Buys ZeroBlock App'}, {'articleText': u' \u201cWe are at the Mosaic stage of bitcoin,\u201d says Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle Internet Financial, a bitcoin-focused technology startup. Mr. Allaire\u2019s analogy, which compares the projected expansion of digital currencies to the past development of Internet technology, is enticing. When the Mosaic browser, a forerunner to Netscape Navigator, was launched in 1993 its capabilities were limited. But it soon gave rise to more powerful competitors that pushed web access out to all corners of the globe. Mr. Allaire and other bitcoin investors see a similar trajectory for bitcoin, a digital unit of exchange whose supply is generated by independent \u201cminers\u201d by solving complicated computations problems. They point out that the Bitcoin Foundation, which coordinates development of bitcoin\u2019s open-source software, is still only designating it as a beta-version 0.8.6. Other enthusiasts see bitcoin as purely a template for alternative digital currencies, much as Mosaic spawned Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome. Both groups are unfazed by Wednesday\u2019s announcement from China\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange that it will stop accepting deposits in yuan, a setback that follows other regulator-driven developments that spooked investors and driven almost 40% off the virtual currency\u2019s value to the dollar in two weeks. Instead, they\u2019re focusing on what they see as the underlying technology\u2019s rich promise: a utopian, cashless and globalized society in which trade is free, government intervention is minimal and transaction costs are near zero. For these true believers, the sharp gyrations in bitcoin markets are a distraction from the far bigger idea that financial liberty is within reach. Of course, history is filled with technologies that failed to fulfill their promise as game-changers. And in bitcoin\u2019s case, there\u2019s a Catch-22 dilemma: the incentive to adopt it depends on a sufficiently large number of people doing so. Moreover, some powerful institutions could have an interest in curtailing digital currencies\u2019 advance. They include banks, whose participation is likely necessary if the financial system is to be overhauled, and governments such as China\u2019s, which currently hold virtual monopolies in currencies. Nonetheless, a striking array of big ideas is bubbling through the virtual-currency \u201cecosystem\u201d \u2013 as the community of investors, bitcoin exchanges, computer engineers, security software developers, and \u201cminers\u201d describes itself. And while wild gyrations in bitcoin\u2019s price could scare off the general public, its 50-fold increase versus the dollar since Jan. 1 is also catching headlines and feeding the collective imagination. Consider the sweeping vision of Richard Olsen, the Zurich-based co-founder of currency trading platform Oanda and a science-driven investment manager. He believes the Internet will become a single global exchange for competing digital coins issued by both private- and public- sector entities and that this could happen within three years if organizations such as banks commit to it. Mr. Olsen dreams of an end to our \u201carcane system\u201d of delivering cash and documents to confirm ownership and of replacing it with one where deals are cleared and settled virtually instantaneously. His world would render many financial intermediaries obsolete and would impose market discipline on competing issuers of different currencies, be they governments, companies or even individuals. For Mr. Olsen, the utopian solution lies not in bitcoin itself but in the cryptography model pioneered by its mysterious founder, the presumably pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. This technology, Mr. Olsen says, will facilitate secure, paperless exchanges and transform a financial system that \u2013 even with the prevalence of electronic commerce \u2014 remains dependent on cumbersome transfers of cash. If banks issued their own digital currencies instead, they would no longer have to manage the costly business of storing and shuttling cash among themselves and could generate tens of billions of dollars in cost savings for the financial system. It\u2019s not clear banks would want to upend a system in which they are heavily invested. Already, they have proven reluctant to do business with bitcoin-based operators. Yet digital coin evangelists aren\u2019t fazed by such resistance \u2013 nor by that of China. Circle Internet\u2019s Mr. Allaire argues that, once China fulfills its promise to open up its capital account, it will embrace bitcoin as a way to undermine the dollar\u2019s global dominance. And Mr. Olsen believes a growing community of private businesses and individuals will in any case bypass legacy payment systems, forcing governments and banks to run with the tide rather than swim against it. If they succeed \u2013 and it remains a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 the implications are profound. Widespread currency digitization would make policies such as monetary targets and capital controls redundant. It would force government currencies into competition with digital alternatives, constraining authorities\u2019 ability to manipulate their value. It could let exporters in countries with overvalued currencies such as Greece restore their competitiveness and allow citizens in countries with capital controls such as China and Argentina to buy foreign goods and make overseas investments. An economy where every transaction is digitally cleared would also generate superior information. Economists could run daily analyses of money flows to devise instantaneous estimates of global demand, supplanting dated and imperfect government surveys. Whether fact or fantasy, such grandiose ideas are currently motivating investors, computer scientists, lawyers and public policy experts to pursue ground-breaking innovations in digital currencies. Something big will come of this \u201ctsunami of openness,\u201d as Mr. Allaire calls it. It\u2019s just hard to predict what exactly that is. \u2013 Follow Michael J. Casey on Twitter: @mikejcasey.

The currency, which has caught the fancy of some in the tech world, has also come under scrutiny of some of the world\u2019s largest central banks, including China\u2019s and France\u2019s, which have both warned of the danger of using the currency that isn\u2019t backed by a government or central bank.

Mr. Orszag, vice chairman of corporate and investment banking at Citigroup, said in a discussion Wednesday sponsored by The Atlantic in New York that he is focused less on regulations like the Volcker rule than on what he deems the best way to improve the banking sector: through higher capital ratios. High capital requirements are the \u201cbest insurance policy\u201d against another financial crisis, he said. \u201cFar more important than structural regulations\u2026are the capital requirements,\u201d he said. Higher capital ratios are \u201cthe single best thing to look at\u201d and from that perspective, he said, the banking industry is \u201cmuch healthier than it was two or three years ago.\u201d \u201cYou can have all the structural constraints you want\u201d and limit activities within the banks such as trading, but \u201cif you don\u2019t have a big capital cushion, it\u2019s not going to work\u201d for big financial institutions, he said. Mr. Orszag, who was previously director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Barack Obama, said Citigroup has exceeded the capital thresholds it had pledged to meet, and said that generally, widespread implementation of Basel III requirements would be \u201chelpful.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re already there,\u201d he said, and other banks \u201care on track to be there.\u201d He\u2019s not sanguine about the entire financial sector, however. He pointed to the future of government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac an example of unfinished business. Mr. Orszag referenced a paper he had co-written in the early 2000s that predicted a very small likelihood the entities would get into trouble. That paper reminded him \u201cto be very cautious about the false precision\u201d of historically-based econometric models, he said. Mr. Orszag also weighed in bitcoin, saying that while it would never be the reserve currency, and while there are regulatory questions, from an economics perspective, \u201cmoney is anything that people will accept a medium for exchange.\u201d He said he personally would not buy bitcoin right now.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Julie Steinberg', 'email': 'Julie Steinberg'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/18/citigroups-orszag-on-volcker-bitcoin/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 18, 18, 49), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Citigroup&rsquo;s Orszag on Volcker, Bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u' Snoop Dogg, rapper, artist, newly converted Rastafarian, caused a bit of a flurry earlier this month when he wrote on Twitter that his new album would be available for purchase via the virtual currency bitcoin. Was he serious? Had Calvin Broadus really embraced the digital currency revolution? Well\u2026no. It may sound goofy to care about something like that, but it\u2019s not really. As we\u2019ve said before, bitcoin\u2019s greatest promise lies in its ability to be a normal, stable, even staid, payments system. The more people and retailers that accept it, the greater its utility gets. Screaming headlines about rallies and crashes in the currency\u2019s value get all the attention, but what matters is whether or not people use it in their daily life. A Lamborghini dealer in California sold a Tesla via bitcoin. We reported on the University of Nicosia in Cyprus, which started accepting bitcoin for tuition and other college costs. Richard Branson will take bitcoin as payments for trips to outer space. So, getting Snoop Dogg on board would\u2019ve been quite a coup for the bitcoiners. In the beginning of December, the rapper sent out this tweet: My next record available in bitcoin n delivered in a drone. \u2014 Snoop Dogg (@SnoopDogg) December 2, 2013 Alas, representatives of the singer said it was a joke.\xa0The second-half of the tweet kind of gives it away, because while it\u2019s not outlandish to imagine Snoop Dogg embracing bitcoin, it\u2019s hard to imagine his record label has. But, there is a singer who is planning to accept bitcoin. Who, you ask? Melanie Brown, aka Mel B, aka Scary Spice, who said she will be selling her new song, \u201cFor Once in My Life,\u201d on Christmas Day, and will accept bitcoin as payment on her website. It did set us to wondering though, if Mr. Dogg really did embrace bitcoin, how would he translate it into his own particular idiom? Well, he\u2019d still call it \u201cbitcoin,\u201d at least according to the Gizoogle search engine, which apparently translates everything into gangsta, but the description of it gets more colorful (editor\u2019s note: this was about the only thing we could reproduce that didn\u2019t contain profanity): \u201cIt aint nuthin but like electronic chedda dat you can use ta pay playaz or merchants.\u201d So the next time some neophyte asks you what bitcoin is, drop that wisdom on them.

The rapper \u2014 that would be Kanye West \u2014 has officially filed a lawsuit against Coinye \u2014 that would be the bitcoin-like electronic currency that started out as something of a joke before taking on a life of its own. Mr. West filed suit in Manhattan federal court, seeking to stop the currency from ever launching as well as unspecified damages. It appears that the anonymous Coinye founders have already backed down.\xa0Currently, the\xa0website for coinye\xa0has only this message: \u201cCoinye is dead.

New ownership, better things coming. http://t.co/2y72eLN6Ir \u2014 Coinye (@CoinyeCoins) January 14, 2014 They were not immediately available for comment. Coinye never seemed like a serious endeavor from the start, but it points to the almost limitless potential for alternative currencies now that bitcoin has become a phenomenon. Bitcoin was launched in 2009, and last year its profile grew exponentially. After starting the year off below $20, its value skyrocketed, bolstered by some real world events: the never-ending U.S. government squabbling and eventual partial shutdown, the financial crisis in Cyprus, with the threat of depositors assets being seized, and the grudging acceptance from governments in the U.S. and China (China has since cooled on the idea). The question, though, is if bitcoin \u2014 an electronic, decentralized, alternative currency that isn\u2019t backed by any bank or government but instead a far-flung community of users \u2014 can have credence and acceptance, what\u2019s to stop anybody else from creating their own alternative virtual currency? The answer is nothing, and there have been a number of them, from ones that seem serious like litecoin to ones that seem downright silly, like dogecoin and coinye. Mr. West, whose sense of humor was\xa0infamously parodied on the TV show \u201cSouth Park,\u201d hasn\u2019t liked Coinye from the start. The currency started getting attention in early January, and Mr. West filed cease-and-desist orders on Jan. 6. The currency\u2019s originators were initially defiant. They slightly altered the name, hoping to get around the order, and moved their servers to India. For good measure, they also changed the logo: from a likeness of Mr. West to a likeness of Mr. West as a fish, a play on the \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode (you have to see it to get the joke). Presumably Mr. West (who did give \u201cSouth Park\u201d credit for the spoof) wasn\u2019t amused by that, either.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/01/14/kanye-takes-coinye-to-court-and-coinye-backs-down/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 14, 16, 1), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Kanye Takes Coinye to Court, and Coinye Backs Down'}, {'articleText': u' Some day in the far off future, when we\u2019ve all got chips implanted in our temples and synced to our Google glasses, Justin Beiber is running for president and \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d is beginning its 29th apocalyptic season, we imagine bitcoin will be boring. Just another thing, a thing that most people don\u2019t even think about anymore. Boring may not seem like much of a goal, but it is for a currency, especially a new, radical, alternative, currently exciting one like bitcoin.\xa0Because when bitcoin becomes boring, that means it will have integrated itself into daily life. The alternative currency briefly spiked up over $1,000 over the weekend, at least on Mt. Gox\u2019s exchange, after Overstock started accepting bitcoin as a payment option (with\xa0CEO Patrick Byrne predicting that Amazon will follow soon enough). Since running up to more than $1,200 in 2013 \u2014 after starting out below $20 \u2014 it\u2019s been more or less range bound (\u201crange bound\u201d for bitcoin, mind you, is a very wide range.) On Monday it was trading around $900. The spike in prices, though, is benefiting only a small group, Steven Englander,\xa0global head of G10 strategy at Citi,\xa0wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThe distribution of bitcoin holdings looks much like the distribution of wealth in North Korea and makes China\u2019s and even the U.S.\u2019 wealth distribution look like that of a workers\u2019 paradise,\u201d he wrote in a weekend note to clients. In the early days of bitcoin, people got it by \u201cmining\u201d for it, essentially turning their computers to the task of extracting and solving math equations from the algorithm that\u2019s at the heart of bitcoin. As more people got involved, the equations got increasingly harder (a feature of the system to control the level of mining). \xa0Those early adopters thus had, and continue to have, a huge advantage in terms of the price. Mr. Englander (citing other sources) estimated that 1% of bitcoin holders are sitting on 80% of the total value. In that case, bitcoin has \u201cseignorage\u201d like any other asset, he argues, and while that can create some serious imbalances, it also could produce some social good: if those early holders are driven to encourage bitcoin\u2019s use, even for their own profit, it could drive wider adoption of bitcoin, and that\u2019s where it becomes relevant, he thinks. \u201cWe are less excited about Bitcoin as a store of value and alternative to fiat currencies than about its potential use in facilitating transaction and improving payments efficiency,\u201d Mr. Englander wrote. This is similar to what we\u2019ve been saying for some time, that bitcoin\u2019s value lies more in its ability to be a mundane facility for people\u2019s daily needs than some spectacular modern gold rush. \u201cNet, net, we like small-\u2018b\u2019 generic bitcoin as a payments technology more than big-\u2018B\u2019 brand-name Bitcoin as a store of value,\u201d he wrote. The idea of bitcoin as a payments system is gaining steam. Overstock\u2019s Mr. Byrne noted, importantly, that the company isn\u2019t keeping payments it receives in bitcoin as bitcoin. It\u2019s converting that into dollars. Because his suppliers aren\u2019t using bitcoin, there\u2019s no reason for him to hold onto them, he said. So, in essence, what Overstock is doing is using it only as a payments system, like, say, PayPal. That isn\u2019t to denigrate bitcoin (or PayPal, for that matter). As 2014 progresses, this will be where bitcoin developments get interesting, not the price movement. In fact, Lightspeed Venture\u2019s Maninder Gulati thinks\xa0bitcoin will evolve beyond being just a store of value or payments system in 2014. We\u2019ve heard similar predictions from others; that what\u2019s really important is the underlying protocol, and as bitcoin develops, more entrepreneurs will come up with ways to use it that are beyond mere currency. And that\u2019s when things will get exciting. One of Mr. Gulati\u2019s other interesting predictions is that this year will see the advent of an interface that brings bitcoin to the masses in the same way Netscape\u2019s browser brought the Internet to the masses in the 1990s. \u201cIt is still very difficult for the average \u2018Joe\u2019 to understand, acquire, store and use bitcoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHence, what a \u2018browser\u2019 did to the Internet, a product or technology innovation will do it to bitcoin in 2014.\u201d Citi\u2019s Mr. Englander, in fact, sees a path in which alternative currencies become accepted as an asset class, and possibly even absorbed into the existing system. \u201cBusinesses are likely to prefer whichever payments system gives the best combination of safety, security and stability. They are likely to be indifferent whether these characteristics will be found inside or outside the conventional financial system or whether the preferred vehicle is the original bitcoin, a bitcoin lookalike, or USD-coin that makes transacting easier.\u201d A bitcoin greenback?

For that, bitcoin owners can partly thank online gaming company, Zynga, whose quiet announcement over the weekend that it is testing a system to allow players of certain online games to purchase items with bitcoin was portrayed as a vote of confidence in the digital currency. Coming after online retailer Overstock.com last month outlined plans to allow customers to transact in bitcoin later this year, the Zynga development adds another small piece to a payment network that needs to grow if the virtual currency is to become an accepted unit of exchange and a store of value. But while there\u2019s no denying the PR benefits to bitcoin from brand-name merchants getting involved, it\u2019s important to appreciate the limits to what they are doing. The fact is that virtually all businesses that accept bitcoin are severely limiting their exposure to the currency\u2019s volatile valuations. (Thanks in part to the Zynga news, that volatility has been on display these past few days: Bitcoin was last quoted at $952.86, according to an aggregated bitcoin price index provided by Coindesk, but was as high as $1,023.17 earlier Monday and as low as $829.85 at its close on Friday.) That merchants are seeking to protect themselves from this volatility doesn\u2019t mean gains aren\u2019t made in terms of network effects every time a retailer signs up to increase the shopping options for bitcoin owners. But their understandable caution is also a reminder of how far bitcoin needs to go to earn true \u201ccurrency\u201d status. Consider the low-fanfare Zynga announcement, which came via a short post on a Reddit bitcoin forum Saturday. It is restricting the bitcoin purchases option to \u201cselect\u201d web games on Zynga.com, which means it won\u2019t be available via third-party platforms such as Facebook, the most popular platform for Zynga games. By using a low-profile publicity strategy to announce it was \u201cconducting a Bitcoin test,\u201d Zynga signaled the low-scale nature of its plans, which cover only \u201cin-game purchases\u201d of low-cost items for virtual-world games such as Farmville 2, Castleville and Chefville. It seemed as much designed to seek feedback from users and, presumably, to generate buzz around Zynga as anything else. Most important, Zynga is conducting its test with the help of bitcoin payments processor Bitpay, which now has 12,000 merchants using its service. Bitpay sets up transactions so that merchants are entirely remunerated in their local currency and face no exchange-rate risk. As an announcer explains in an introductory video pitch to merchants on the Bitpay website, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to know what the heck a bitcoin is. You are also completely insulated from the bitcoin exchange rate.\u201d In this context, news reports stating that \u201cXYZ merchant is now accepting bitcoin\u201d need to be taken with a grain of salt. That said, the Overstock.com development is potentially more significant. The firm is on track to post revenue of more than $1.3 billion for 2013. If a sizable enough portion of that went to bitcoin, the Bitpay platform may not have the capacity to handle it. Yet Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne, who sees bitcoin aligning with his philosophical interest in developing a non-fiat currencies that \u201cno government mandarin can create with the stroke of a pen,\u201d isn\u2019t fazed. He says there are ways to reduce exposure to exchange-rate fluctuations down to 15-minute periods and is exploring other means of reducing risk, including end-of-day currency clearing and, eventually, bitcoin derivatives. He expects the market for such hedging instruments to \u201cget thicker and to greatly feed on itself.\u201d Mr. Byrne adds that he will consider holding bitcoin for Overstock\u2019s own account if enough of its suppliers start accepting the digital currency. So far the only conversations he has had on that are with Chinese suppliers, who he says were enthusiastic until the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s recent moves to block purchases of bitcoin. For now, such statements work to further bitcoin\u2019s cause by building buzz and interest rather than significantly advancing its level of adoption. That\u2019s not to say announcements such as Zynga\u2019s and Overstock\u2019s don\u2019t provide a useful way for entrepreneurs in the fledgling bitcoin industry to generate interest in their products. After Anthony Di Iorio, a co-founder of bitcoin wallet provider KryptoKit, posted a video showing how he purchased a Zynga item, a discussion ensued on Reddit about how easily the transaction was made, how the user provided no personal information to Zynga, and about the low transaction costs involved. At last count, the video had 6,432 views. The buzz is likely to continue around bitcoin. But until a major merchant starts accepting bitcoin for its own account, adoption is likely to be a gradual, incremental process. \u2013 Follow Michael J.

The island\u2019s financial regulator said Monday that physical teller machines for the virtual currency \u201cwill not appear\u201d here, after Las Vegas-based RoboCoin, which makes bitcoin ATMs, reportedly said it had chosen Taiwan and Hong Kong as its first spots to expand in Asia. \u201cBitcoin is not a legal tender. Banks should not accept savings in bitcoins and the FSC will not allow the installation of bitcoin ATMs in Taiwan,\u201d Tseng Ming-chung, chairman of Taiwan\u2019s Financial Supervisory Commission, told The Wall Street Journal on Monday. RoboCoin couldn\u2019t be reached for comment Monday during Asian daytime hours. RoboCoin launched its first bitcoin ATM in a Vancouver coffee shop in November, where it racked up 1 million Canadian dollars (US$941,500) in transactions in less than a month. ATM users can either buy or sell bitcoin through the machines. Taiwan is not alone in dodging the newfangled bitcoin frenzy. Governments and banks around the world are worried that the absence of scrutiny over bitcoin\u2014which isn\u2019t issued or backed by a central government but is created through a sophisticated computer process\u2014could be a hotbed for money laundering or other illegal activities. China\u2019s central bank last month asked some domestic payment processors to stop trading with the country\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange, BTC China. The move sent the virtual currency\u2019s value plunging by as much as 38% against the dollar at the time. The People\u2019s Bank of China also said financial institutions shouldn\u2019t take deposits from bitcoin-related businesses or provide them insurance or custody services, though it said individuals could continue to buy and sell bitcoin. Hong Kong\u2019s finance chief John Tsang warned in December that the bitcoin run couldn\u2019t last forever because there was \u201cno support from the real economy,\u201d but the city\u2019s Monetary Authority has reportedly said it won\u2019t regulate the bitcoin ATMs. According to Mt.Gox, an online bitcoin exchange, the virtual currency is currently trading at $1,049. The currency started 2013 at less than $20 and crossed the $1,000 threshold in November before plunging to $640 after BTC China stopping taking deposits. Taiwan\u2019s FSC said that usage of bitcoin on the island is \u201cminimal,\u201d with only a handful of online game providers accepting the currency. Wayi International Digital Entertainment Co., a Taiwanese online game provider, has said it intends to accept bitcoin and may even become an exchange. \u201cIf bitcoins do expand into the local market, we will then consider launching more measures to strengthen our supervision,\u201d Mr. Tseng said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/01/06/taiwan-rejects-bitcoin-atms/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 6, 5, 24), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Taiwan Rejects Bitcoin ATMs'}, {'articleText': u' From Bitcoin to Tesla wild ride to the stock market\u2019s rally to record levels, 2013 offered a little something for everyone.

By law, a fiduciary\u2014like a doctor or a lawyer\u2014must act in the best interests of his client and seek to avoid all material conflicts of interest. Investment advisers are required to act as fiduciaries, but stockbrokers and insurance agents generally aren\u2019t\u2014yet. As early as October, the U.S. Department of Labor is expected to propose new rules that would ensure that brokers and other securities professionals would act solely for the benefit of their clients when advising on individual retirement accounts. Those assets are a giant honey pot, with $5.41 trillion in IRAs, according to the Federal Reserve. 9. Berkshire\u2019s Tracy Britt Brings CEOs Together\nBy Anupreeta Das\nJune 12 Warren Buffett is famously hands-off when it comes to running the subsidiary businesses of Berkshire Hathaway, but some Berkshire CEOs have been craving a little more contact \u2013 at least with each other. Buffett\u2019s financial assistant Tracy Britt is making it happen. The 28-year-old Harvard MBA has worked by the legendary investor\u2019s side since 2009, and is taking on more responsibility within Berkshire, including the chairmanship of four of its subsidiaries. One of her goals is to increase interaction among the managers of Berkshire\u2019s 80-odd businesses. She travels frequently to the far-flung units to visit Berkshire executives and learn about their business challenges and practices, often using that knowledge to put CEOs in touch with each other. 8. Apple Shares Are Dirt Cheap; So What?\nBy Steven Russolillo\nApril 18 Apple Inc. shares haven\u2019t been this cheap in at least 10 years. Investors don\u2019t care. The steep plunge in Apple\u2019s stock price over the past seven months got us wondering: When it will become attractive enough for bargain hunters to start scooping up more shares and bump the price higher? Worries about slowing growth and increasing competition have sent the stock down by more than 40% since it peaked above $700 in September. Shares are now trading at 9.08 times projected earnings for the next 12 months, according to FactSet, the lowest level in at least 10 years. Price-to-earnings ratios are calculated by taking a stock\u2019s price and dividing it by the company\u2019s earnings per share. 7. Madoff Five Years Later: Where Are Some of the Key Players Now?\nBy WSJ Staff\nDec. 10 Five years after Bernard L. Madoff\u2019s massive Ponzi scheme was unveiled, here\u2019s a look at what several of his family members, employees and investors are up to now. The post recounts how their lives were forever altered by the biggest financial fraud in history. 6. Apple Loses Throne as World\u2019s Biggest Company\nBy Steven Russolillo\nApril 17 Apple Inc. is no longer on top. Wednesday\u2019s steep slide in Apple\u2019s shares has pushed the tech giant to second place on the list of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Oil giant Exxon Mobil has reclaimed the throne. As the chart shows, both companies have been jockeying back and forth for the top spot for much of 2013. Prior to that, Apple had been the clear-cut king from January 2012 through this past January. And before that, Exxon had been the king dating back to 2006. 5. Detroit\u2019s Bankruptcy: 40% of Street Lights Don\u2019t Work, 66% of Ambulances Out of Service\nBy Mike Cherney\nJuly 18 Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy petition paints a bleak picture for the Motor City: more than 100,000 creditors, more than $18 billion in accrued obligations and a homicide rate that is at its highest level in nearly 40 years. Detroit filed for bankruptcy protection Thursday afternoon, becoming the largest ever municipal bankruptcy case. It becomes the latest in a small but high-profile list of municipalities to file after the recession. The cities of Stockton and San Bernardino in California filed last summer and Jefferson County, Ala., did so in November 2011. 4. Stocks Plunge, Quickly Recover, on Fake Tweet\nBy Paul Vigna\nApril 23 The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged within minutes early this afternoon, after somebody hacked an AP Twitter account and posted a bogus tweet saying the White House had been attacked. The Dow, which had been up about 130 points, fell into the red within two minutes, and then bounced back just as quickly as it became obvious that the \u201cnews\u201d was false, and a prank. Here, for your edification, is a screenshot of the fake tweet. White House spokesman Jay Carney quickly got on the air and dismissed the story. \u201cThe president is fine,\u201d Carney said. \u201cI was just with him.\u201d 3. Meet the Man Who Has Worked at Goldman for 80 Years\nBy Justin Baer\nJuly 12 One day into his job at Goldman Sachs, Alfred Feld found his name on a list of employees the firm had targeted for layoffs. Then fate, and a supportive boss, intervened. Eighty years later, Mr. Feld is still at it at Goldman. \u201cI came so close to being fired after one day,\u201d Mr. Feld, 98 years old, said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m glad that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d UPDATE: Mr. Feld passed away on Nov. 25. 2. The Intelligent Investor: Saving Investors From Themselves\nBy Jason Zweig\nJune 28 I was once asked, at a journalism conference, how I defined my job. I said: My job is to write the exact same thing between 50 and 100 times a year in such a way that neither my editors nor my readers will ever think I am repeating myself. That\u2019s because good advice rarely changes, while markets change constantly. The temptation to pander is almost irresistible. And while people need good advice, what they want is advice that sounds good. 1.\xa0Wall Street Gives Apple\u2019s New iPhones Thumbs Down\nBy Steven Russolillo\nSept. 11 Wall Street\u2019s initial reviews on Apple Inc.\u2019s new iPhones and the company\u2019s pricing strategy are far from favorable. At least three strategists downgraded their investment ratings on Apple Wednesday morning in the aftermath of the company\u2019s latest product launch. Shares fell as much as 6% to $464.81 minutes after the opening bell. Through Tuesday\u2019s close, the stock had been up 25% since the end of June. Still, it remains a far cry from its record high above $700 in September. Apple introduced a pair of new iPhones with upgraded features, but didn\u2019t stray from its usual playbook, a strategy that has sparked concerns amid growing competition from the likes of Samsung Electronics Co. and handset makers using Google Android software.

You can buy a Tesla with bitcoin. You can pay for\xa0college classes with bitcoin. There\u2019s a guy out on Long Island who will sell you his house in bitcoin. You can buy companies, too. Earlier this week, ZeroBlock, which publishes a bitcoin-related mobile app of the same name, sold itself to Blockchain.info, which operates a popular bitcoin \u201cwallet.\u201d What really caught our eye is that the transaction \u2014 the purchase price was not disclosed \u2014 was handled entirely in bitcoin, according to one of ZeroBlock\u2019s two founders, Dan Held. The announcement was made on Christmas Eve. \u201cIt was a very nice Christmas present,\u201d Mr. Held said. Mr. Held and his business partner, Kevin Johnson, sold all of the assets and intellectual property to Blockchain. They kept the legal entity ZeroBlock LLC to themselves. While it was essentially a cash transaction, the cash in question was bitcoin. As we\u2019ve said before, to us the future of bitcoin doesn\u2019t lie in its wildly fluctuating exchange rates, but in its utility as a means of exchange, as a payments system, as something as mundane and boring \u2014 and stable and utilitarian \u2014 as a dollar bill. It certainly isn\u2019t surprising that players in the bitcoin world would use the currency in their transactions \u2013 it might be more surprising if they didn\u2019t use bitcoin. However, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the transaction was handled using the crypto-currency, and while it\u2019s not the first deal done in bitcoin, it does serve to illustrate that these kinds of deals can be done. Quite easily, according to Mr. Held. \u201cUsing bitcoin was much easier than wiring the funds through traditional means,\u201d Mr. Held told MoneyBeat in an email. \u201cIt only took about 20 seconds to get confirmation.\u201d They used the U.S. dollar pricing on bitstamp to determine the execution price, he said. Both Mr. Held and Mr. Johnson converted a portion of their earnings into U.S. dollars to handle tax liabilities. ZeroBlock is an app that launched in the spring that collects and displays bitcoin price quotes from the various exchanges. It also has some graphs, links to stories on reddit and elsewhere, a currency translator, and push notifications (full disclosure: we here at MoneyBeat have been using it since summer, when we first read about it).

Mr. Allaire\u2019s analogy, which compares the projected expansion of digital currencies to the past development of Internet technology, is enticing. When the Mosaic browser, a forerunner to Netscape Navigator, was launched in 1993 its capabilities were limited. But it soon gave rise to more powerful competitors that pushed web access out to all corners of the globe. Mr. Allaire and other bitcoin investors see a similar trajectory for bitcoin, a digital unit of exchange whose supply is generated by independent \u201cminers\u201d by solving complicated computations problems. They point out that the Bitcoin Foundation, which coordinates development of bitcoin\u2019s open-source software, is still only designating it as a beta-version 0.8.6. Other enthusiasts see bitcoin as purely a template for alternative digital currencies, much as Mosaic spawned Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome. Both groups are unfazed by Wednesday\u2019s announcement from China\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange that it will stop accepting deposits in yuan, a setback that follows other regulator-driven developments that spooked investors and driven almost 40% off the virtual currency\u2019s value to the dollar in two weeks. Instead, they\u2019re focusing on what they see as the underlying technology\u2019s rich promise: a utopian, cashless and globalized society in which trade is free, government intervention is minimal and transaction costs are near zero. For these true believers, the sharp gyrations in bitcoin markets are a distraction from the far bigger idea that financial liberty is within reach. Of course, history is filled with technologies that failed to fulfill their promise as game-changers. And in bitcoin\u2019s case, there\u2019s a Catch-22 dilemma: the incentive to adopt it depends on a sufficiently large number of people doing so. Moreover, some powerful institutions could have an interest in curtailing digital currencies\u2019 advance. They include banks, whose participation is likely necessary if the financial system is to be overhauled, and governments such as China\u2019s, which currently hold virtual monopolies in currencies. Nonetheless, a striking array of big ideas is bubbling through the virtual-currency \u201cecosystem\u201d \u2013 as the community of investors, bitcoin exchanges, computer engineers, security software developers, and \u201cminers\u201d describes itself. And while wild gyrations in bitcoin\u2019s price could scare off the general public, its 50-fold increase versus the dollar since Jan. 1 is also catching headlines and feeding the collective imagination. Consider the sweeping vision of Richard Olsen, the Zurich-based co-founder of currency trading platform Oanda and a science-driven investment manager. He believes the Internet will become a single global exchange for competing digital coins issued by both private- and public- sector entities and that this could happen within three years if organizations such as banks commit to it. Mr. Olsen dreams of an end to our \u201carcane system\u201d of delivering cash and documents to confirm ownership and of replacing it with one where deals are cleared and settled virtually instantaneously. His world would render many financial intermediaries obsolete and would impose market discipline on competing issuers of different currencies, be they governments, companies or even individuals. For Mr. Olsen, the utopian solution lies not in bitcoin itself but in the cryptography model pioneered by its mysterious founder, the presumably pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. This technology, Mr. Olsen says, will facilitate secure, paperless exchanges and transform a financial system that \u2013 even with the prevalence of electronic commerce \u2014 remains dependent on cumbersome transfers of cash. If banks issued their own digital currencies instead, they would no longer have to manage the costly business of storing and shuttling cash among themselves and could generate tens of billions of dollars in cost savings for the financial system. It\u2019s not clear banks would want to upend a system in which they are heavily invested. Already, they have proven reluctant to do business with bitcoin-based operators. Yet digital coin evangelists aren\u2019t fazed by such resistance \u2013 nor by that of China. Circle Internet\u2019s Mr. Allaire argues that, once China fulfills its promise to open up its capital account, it will embrace bitcoin as a way to undermine the dollar\u2019s global dominance. And Mr. Olsen believes a growing community of private businesses and individuals will in any case bypass legacy payment systems, forcing governments and banks to run with the tide rather than swim against it. If they succeed \u2013 and it remains a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 the implications are profound. Widespread currency digitization would make policies such as monetary targets and capital controls redundant. It would force government currencies into competition with digital alternatives, constraining authorities\u2019 ability to manipulate their value. It could let exporters in countries with overvalued currencies such as Greece restore their competitiveness and allow citizens in countries with capital controls such as China and Argentina to buy foreign goods and make overseas investments. An economy where every transaction is digitally cleared would also generate superior information. Economists could run daily analyses of money flows to devise instantaneous estimates of global demand, supplanting dated and imperfect government surveys. Whether fact or fantasy, such grandiose ideas are currently motivating investors, computer scientists, lawyers and public policy experts to pursue ground-breaking innovations in digital currencies. Something big will come of this \u201ctsunami of openness,\u201d as Mr. Allaire calls it. It\u2019s just hard to predict what exactly that is. \u2013 Follow Michael J. Casey on Twitter: @mikejcasey.

Bitcoin prices, which trade on a number of different exchanges, had soared recently, but on Wednesday night in Asia, they were down 19% from Tuesday\u2019s close to $556.48, for a decline of more than 50% from its high of $1,147.25 two weeks ago. Some are worried China is moving to block the purchase and use of the currency by its citizens. So which is it? A virtual fad? Or a real currency that will gain increasing acceptance?

Mr. Orszag, vice chairman of corporate and investment banking at Citigroup, said in a discussion Wednesday sponsored by The Atlantic in New York that he is focused less on regulations like the Volcker rule than on what he deems the best way to improve the banking sector: through higher capital ratios. High capital requirements are the \u201cbest insurance policy\u201d against another financial crisis, he said. \u201cFar more important than structural regulations\u2026are the capital requirements,\u201d he said. Higher capital ratios are \u201cthe single best thing to look at\u201d and from that perspective, he said, the banking industry is \u201cmuch healthier than it was two or three years ago.\u201d \u201cYou can have all the structural constraints you want\u201d and limit activities within the banks such as trading, but \u201cif you don\u2019t have a big capital cushion, it\u2019s not going to work\u201d for big financial institutions, he said. Mr. Orszag, who was previously director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Barack Obama, said Citigroup has exceeded the capital thresholds it had pledged to meet, and said that generally, widespread implementation of Basel III requirements would be \u201chelpful.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re already there,\u201d he said, and other banks \u201care on track to be there.\u201d He\u2019s not sanguine about the entire financial sector, however. He pointed to the future of government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac an example of unfinished business. Mr. Orszag referenced a paper he had co-written in the early 2000s that predicted a very small likelihood the entities would get into trouble. That paper reminded him \u201cto be very cautious about the false precision\u201d of historically-based econometric models, he said. Mr. Orszag also weighed in bitcoin, saying that while it would never be the reserve currency, and while there are regulatory questions, from an economics perspective, \u201cmoney is anything that people will accept a medium for exchange.\u201d He said he personally would not buy bitcoin right now.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Julie Steinberg', 'email': 'Julie Steinberg'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/18/citigroups-orszag-on-volcker-bitcoin/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 18, 18, 49), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Citigroup&rsquo;s Orszag on Volcker, Bitcoin'}, {'articleText': u' Snoop Dogg, rapper, artist, newly converted Rastafarian, caused a bit of a flurry earlier this month when he wrote on Twitter that his new album would be available for purchase via the virtual currency bitcoin. Was he serious? Had Calvin Broadus really embraced the digital currency revolution? Well\u2026no. It may sound goofy to care about something like that, but it\u2019s not really. As we\u2019ve said before, bitcoin\u2019s greatest promise lies in its ability to be a normal, stable, even staid, payments system. The more people and retailers that accept it, the greater its utility gets. Screaming headlines about rallies and crashes in the currency\u2019s value get all the attention, but what matters is whether or not people use it in their daily life. A Lamborghini dealer in California sold a Tesla via bitcoin. We reported on the University of Nicosia in Cyprus, which started accepting bitcoin for tuition and other college costs. Richard Branson will take bitcoin as payments for trips to outer space. So, getting Snoop Dogg on board would\u2019ve been quite a coup for the bitcoiners. In the beginning of December, the rapper sent out this tweet: My next record available in bitcoin n delivered in a drone. \u2014 Snoop Dogg (@SnoopDogg) December 2, 2013 Alas, representatives of the singer said it was a joke.\xa0The second-half of the tweet kind of gives it away, because while it\u2019s not outlandish to imagine Snoop Dogg embracing bitcoin, it\u2019s hard to imagine his record label has. But, there is a singer who is planning to accept bitcoin. Who, you ask? Melanie Brown, aka Mel B, aka Scary Spice, who said she will be selling her new song, \u201cFor Once in My Life,\u201d on Christmas Day, and will accept bitcoin as payment on her website. It did set us to wondering though, if Mr. Dogg really did embrace bitcoin, how would he translate it into his own particular idiom? Well, he\u2019d still call it \u201cbitcoin,\u201d at least according to the Gizoogle search engine, which apparently translates everything into gangsta, but the description of it gets more colorful (editor\u2019s note: this was about the only thing we could reproduce that didn\u2019t contain profanity): \u201cIt aint nuthin but like electronic chedda dat you can use ta pay playaz or merchants.\u201d So the next time some neophyte asks you what bitcoin is, drop that wisdom on them.

The value of the currency has risen exponentially; it\u2019s been taken seriously by government officials and central bankers (not always favorably, but seriously) the world over; and it\u2019s sparked excitement among the financial press and blogosphere, certainly.\xa0But, in absolute terms, it remains a tiny phenomenon, and for all the attention it gets, there\u2019s just as much misunderstanding. \u201cThe \u2018bitcoin bubble\u2019 meme has become the financial equivalent of a viral online cat video \u2013 wildly popular but pretty vacuous,\u201d Nicholas Colas, ConvergEx\u2019s chief market strategist, wrote in his morning note to clients. What exactly is a bitcoin? Even people who think they know have trouble explaining it. Most people think of it as a currency, but there\u2019s debate about that (try to buy martini somewhere and find out for yourself). The Chinese, for instance, consider it a commodity. Still others argue it\u2019s nothing more than an elaborate Ponzi scheme. If you ask us, we\u2019ll tell it\u2019s quite simply a payments system. But that\u2019s just us. Mr. Colas, in an attempt to fill the vacuous vacuum with something material, outlined 11 myths surrounding bitcoin and his interpretations, from \u201cbitcoin is huge\u201d (it isn\u2019t) to \u201cbitcoin is a store of value\u201d (not yet it isn\u2019t). Here are a couple of entries that stood out to us: \u201cMyth #3: Bitcoin is a currency. \u201cReality: Bitcoin really is a cross between a mutually held company or large partnership and a money transfer business.\xa0 Its utility is that the bitcoin miners \u2013 those trying to solve the puzzles to get the 25 bitcoin reward \u2013 manage the transaction stack (blockchain, in bitcoin-speak) essentially for free.\xa0 You want to be part of the partnership? Great \u2013 buy some bitcoins and hold on.\xa0 But if you just want to send that friend in Buenos Aires money cheaply, you and she might both own bitcoins for a fraction of a second.\xa0 You drop dollars in, she gets pesos out.\xa0 Bitcoin is a system much more than it is a \u201ccurrency\u201d.\xa0 Maybe one day she will buy a beer with bitcoins, but the entire system has tremendous utility even without that functionality.\u201d \u201cMyth #7: Bitcoin is untraceable. \u201cReality: Bitcoin transactions flow through an open-source piece of software, so everyone sees every trade.\xa0 No, there are no name/address identifiers, but Forbes magazine showed how easy it is to trace bitcoins through the system back in September. Methods to \u201cLaunder\u201d bitcoins certainly exist, but so do the risks of handing over your coins to an online thief.\xa0 Bottom line: after hearing about what the NSA can do with your computer and phone records, if you think anything you do online is secret, I can\u2019t help you.\xa0 OK, if you have mad hacking and crypto-skills, maybe.\xa0 But chances are pretty good that you\u2019d just screw it up.\xa0 And get caught.\u201d \u201cMyth #9: It\u2019s a Ponzi scheme! \u201cReality: A Ponzi scheme is one that has no use other than to defraud later victims into giving money to earlier participants.\xa0 Again, bitcoin has a potentially significant positive social value.\xa0 Two regional Federal Reserve papers, published in the last month, agree with that statement.\xa0 But if you still think bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, you should probably get rid of your Federal Reserve notes as well.\xa0 They aren\u2019t \u201cBacked\u201d by anything either.\xa0 Please remit them directly to: Nick Colas, ConvergEx, 1633 Broadway, NY NY 10019.\xa0 I will forward them to one of my favorite charities \u2013 the USO \u2013 where they will do a world of good.\u201d If you want to read the other eight, write Mr. Colas at the above address.

John McDermott said Thursday when asked if local banks and businesses should embrace bitcoin\u2019s potential. \u201cYou have to worry about where\u2019s the supply, how it\u2019s controlled, how it\u2019s monitored,\u201d Mr. McDermott said. \u201cWho knows at this point? There is still a lot for the world to learn on this issue.\u201d Bitcoin is a virtual currency that isn\u2019t backed by any central bank or reserves, but exists only online. Its value is set on exchanges or through private swaps. The currency is \u201ccreated\u201d when computers solve complex mathematical problems, and can then be traded between individuals. For RBNZ Gov. Graeme Wheeler, frothy prices of bitcoins are as much an issue as understanding how it can be used for transactions. \u201cWhat I think is quite worrying is the price volatility around bitcoins,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. \u201cIt has the potential to move quite rapidly.\u201d CoinDesk.com, which uses three exchanges to calculate bitcoin values, said the currency was down 2.6% Thursday. Prices reached US$1,147.25 on Dec. 4 but now trade at around US$864.38 \u2013 up from less than $20 in January and sparking worries of a bubble. Bitcoin prices tumbled almost 13% last Friday after an affiliate of Baidu Inc., China\u2019s biggest Internet search company, stopped accepting payment in bitcoins after the People\u2019s Bank of China said financial institutions shouldn\u2019t take deposits from bitcoin-related businesses or provide them with insurance or custody services. Bitcoins have been especially popular in China. The central bank also warned of risks from speculative trading and money laundering associated with bitcoins, reportedly a favored currency of drug traffickers. Officials and regulators from France and the European Union also have issued warnings recently on bitcoins. The U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has required administrators and exchanges of virtual currencies to report transactions. At the same time, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch currency analyst issued a positive outlook for bitcoin investors \u2013 placing a maximum fair value at $1,300 \u2014 while a university in Cyprus announced it had accepted its first tuition payment in bitcoin. Neither Mr. Wheeler nor Mr. McDermott was entirely dismissive of bitcoin\u2019s potential. \u201cConceptually, the idea is very interesting \u2014 that you can have a means of payment that basically is universally accepted and basically means that you get aside capital controls, you get aside exchange rate issues,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/FarroHoward', 'name': 'Rebecca Howard', 'twitterhandle': '@FarroHoward', 'email': 'Rebecca Howard'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/11/new-zealand-central-bank-joins-others-in-warning-on-bitcoins/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 11, 23, 28), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'New Zealand Central Bank Joins Others in Warning on Bitcoins'}, {'articleText': u' Bitcoin\u2019s wild 2013 ride is not over. The price of bitcoin plunged on Friday, dropping more than 20%, after word that Chinese website Baidu suspended payments\xa0in bitcoin. (Here\u2019s the notice\xa0in the original Chinese Han.) While our Chinese language skills are a bit rusty, the gist of it is this: Because of the extreme volatility in the virtual currency, the site was suspending payments in bitcoin for its music service. China has been behind the surge in bitcoin over the past month, as traders started pouring in from the Middle Kingdom, and it appears to be behind the recent swan dive as well. Just on Thursday, the People\u2019s Bank of China issued a warning about bitcoin, barring the country\u2019s banks from using it for payments and warning of the risks of using it in general. France\u2019s central bank issued a similar warning. Bitcoin was recently trading around $853, on the Mt. Gox exchange. The currency was\xa0trading over the $1,200 mark on Thursday morning, but the Chinese headlines both sparked bouts of selling since then. Bitcoin has had an absolutely wild ride this year, rising from under $20 to more than $1,200, driven almost as much by hype as anything else. In absolute terms, it remains a minor, minor currency and payments system. Yes, an auto dealership in California yesterday announced that it accepted bitcoin as payment for a Tesla Model S (an electric car bought with electric money). But, for all the attention, bitcoin\u2019s value by trading volume, on a good day, puts it in the range of the Hungarian forint, one of the smaller currencies traded. It is absolutely nowhere near trillion-dollar market for the U.S. dollar. The more substantial stories surrounding bitcoin won\u2019t be the sexy trading stories, or the spectacular crime stories, but the relatively staid, mundane stories about who\u2019s accepting bitcoin, and who\u2019s using it. To that end, we got a press release from the University of Nicosia, which we profiled last month for becoming the first school to accept bitcoin. The university announced that it received its first tuition payment in bitcoin from a South African student, who is enrolled in the school\u2019s online MBA program.

Bank of America currency analyst David Woo gave bitcoin fans a boost Thursday, declaring in a research note that the digital currency \u201ccan become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers.\u201d But to Adam Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, such claims ring absurd. \u201cHistory is littered with [failed] alternative currencies,\u201d Mr. Posen told the World Economic Roundtable, a gathering of public policy thinkers sponsored by the New America Foundation in New York. Even more importantly, the People\u2019s Bank of China declared on its website overnight that bitcoin isn\u2019t a \u201creal currency\u201d and said financial institutions can\u2019t provide bitcoin-related services such as deposits and custody services. Some had speculated that China is interested in encouraging bitcoin as part of its ongoing efforts to find a long-term alternative to the dollar as a home for its reserves. Moves by one of state-owned China Telecom\u2019s subsidiaries to accept payments in bitcoin helped stir such talk earlier in the week. But with demand for bitcoin growing rapidly on Chinese-based exchanges, Chinese officials could be concerned that the possibility for anonymity could create incentives for people to use the digital currency to get around Beijing\u2019s strict system of capital controls. Whatever the motive, the PBOC\u2019s statement drove the bitcoin price as low as $840.32 on Mt. Gox\u2019s exchange Thursday, down from Wednesday\u2019s close of $1,096, before bouncing back above $1,100 during U.S. trading hours. Citibank currency analyst Steven Englander says the PBOC\u2019s statement is no death knell for bitcoin. He notes that the central bank is still allowing individuals to transact in bitcoin and says it is more worried about Chinese banks\u2019 exposure to bitcoin\u2019s highly volatile market price than about the digital currency\u2019s expansion as a payments system. Mr. Englander, who heads currency strategy for Citi in New York and has written two research notes on the bitcoin topic since Nov. 27, said \u201cthere has been tremendous client interest,\u201d in the topic, with his first report becoming his most-read piece of research this year. He separates these interested clients into two groups: \u201cthe punters,\u201d a \u201cmore aggressive\u201d breed of institutional investor looking to speculate on bitcoin\u2019s dollar exchange rate; and those at \u201cthe interface between hedge funds and [venture capital firms] who are asking, \u201cWhat can I invest in that is going to be durable here even after the hubbub eventually disappears?\u201d There were also fresh signs this week of the ramped-up efforts from players in the bitcoin industry to encourage bitcoin as a payments system. Butterfly Labs, which makes high-speed encryption processors for use in bitcoin mining \u2014 the process through which the digital coins are brought into being by private operators \u2014 made a donation of 10 bitcoins to Songs of Love, a charity that creates personalized songs for chronically ill children and teens. It was the first major bitcoin donation for Songs of Love, which six months ago became the first children\u2019s charity to solicit donations in bitcoin. At the current exchange rate it would bring in around $11,350, enough to pay the charity\u2019s army of musicians to produce 45 personalized songs for sick kids. If these promotional efforts are successful, however, bitcoin faces the risk that \u201ca clever chap can go out and create \u2018Nitcoin\u2019\u2026and someone else can create \u2018Gitcoin,\u2019 says Citibank\u2019s Englander. Such copycat currencies would increase the supply of digital alternatives and undermine what is probably bitcoin\u2019s strongest selling point as an investment: the fact that only a finite amount of bitcoin can be mined over time. Still, true believers are betting on a first-mover advantage for Bitcoin. And now they have an analyst\u2019s first stab at fair value. It comes from Bank of America\u2019s Woo, who estimated that the maximum market capitalization of the bitcoin supply would run to $15 billion, representing a top future price of $1300 for bitcoin. The Peterson\u2019s Institute\u2019s Posen isn\u2019t buying that. To succeed, he says, bitcoin must become both a store of value for people\u2019s savings and a much more widely accepted unit of account for transactions. But he says investors will be deterred by the extreme volatility from owning bitcoin and that for payments it lacks a key source of leverage enjoyed by currencies issued by the world\u2019s central banks: \u201cYou can force someone to accept dollars as a unit of account but you can\u2019t force them to accept bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u2013 Follow Michael J.

At a speech before the American Enterprise Institute in 1996, Mr. Greenspan talked about the stock market and how he feared \xa0investor enthusiasm pushed prices to levels that weren\u2019t a true reflection of economic fundamentals. For a trip down memory lane, here\u2019s a look at Mr. Greenspan\u2019s comments this day 17 years ago: \u201c\u2026where do we draw the line on what prices matter? Certainly prices of goods and services now being produced \u2014 our basic measure of inflation \u2014 matter. But what about futures prices or more importantly prices of claims on future goods and services, like equities, real estate, or other earning assets? Are stability of these prices essential to the stability of the economy? \u201cClearly, sustained low inflation implies less uncertainty about the future, and lower risk premiums imply higher prices of stocks and other earning assets. We can see that in the inverse relationship exhibited by price/earnings ratios and the rate of inflation in the past. But how do we know when\xa0irrational exuberance\xa0has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade? And how do we factor that assessment into monetary policy?\u201d His call proved correct, albeit years early. U.S. stocks ultimately surged to much higher levels before crashing when the tech bubble burst. Stocks rallied again before crumbling during the financial crisis. And now, stocks trade in fresh record territory amid a bull market that is more than four-and-a-half years old.\xa0The S&P 500 is up about 140% since Mr. Greenspan\u2019s \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d comments 17 years ago. Mr. Greenspan, of course, passed the torch to Ben Bernanke, who will be succeeded as leader of the Fed by Janet Yellen early next year. And with bubble talk running rampant in the markets, Ms. Yellen has already chimed in on the debate, saying stocks are not in a bubble.\xa0\u201cStock prices have risen pretty robustly,\u201d she told lawmakers last month. But looking at several valuation measures \u2014 she specifically cited equity-risk premiums \u2014 she said: \u201cyou would not see stock prices in territory that suggest\u2026bubble-like conditions.\u201d Since Mr. Greenspan said it, the term \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d has reverberated across both Wall Street and Main Street. A Google search for the phrase generates 2.53 million results. Yale economist Robert Shiller, who in October won the Nobel Prize, wrote a book in 2000 called Irrational Exuberance.\xa0When Mr. Greenspan retired from the Fed, the Daily Show ran an entire segment titled \u201cAn Irrationally Exuberant Tribute to Alan Greenspan.\u201d Seventeen years later, Mr. Greenspan is once again spotting bubbles, although this time he\u2019s not talking stocks or housing. Instead, he\u2019s referring to bitcoin,\xa0the four-year old virtual currency created by a man or group of people going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. One bitcoin topped $1,200 last week.\xa0 Speaking on Bloomberg Television on Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan said Bitcoin lacked any intrinsic currency value. From Bloomberg: \u201cIt\u2019s a bubble,\u201d Greenspan, 87, said [Wednesday] in a Bloomberg Television interview from\xa0Washington. \u201cIt has to have intrinsic value. You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven\u2019t been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.\u201d\u2026 \u201cI do not understand where the backing of Bitcoin is coming from,\u201d the former Fed chief said. \u201cThere is no fundamental issue of capabilities of repaying it in anything which is universally acceptable, which is either intrinsic value of the currency or the credit or trust of the individual who is issuing the money, whether it\u2019s a government or an individual.\u201d UPDATE:\xa0Mr. Greenspan\u2019s \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d comments came in 1996.

It\u2019s because the story of the Netherlands\u2019 great tulip bubble of 1637 helps focus the mind on the basic question at the heart of any financial bubble assessment: whether there\u2019s a blatant disconnect between an asset\u2019s price and its fundamental value. There are some decent arguments why bitcoin\u2019s detractors could be wrong. But, either way, anyone hoping to ride this rally higher should think about what constitutes the digital currency\u2019s fundamental value. Of course, there\u2019s no surefire way to determine fundamental or fair value\u2013notwithstanding the useful benchmarks for doing so in markets such as stocks\u2013especially for something as untested as this. But the lesson of Tulip Mania is that when prices truly get into bubble territory, your gut can be as good a gauge as anything. At its peak, the price for a single tulip bulb in 1637 stood at 10 times the annual income of a skilled Dutch craftsman. Based on that simple, fundamental assessment of the market\u2019s potential, something was clearly amiss. So, what of bitcoin and the 8,900% rally since Jan. 1 that took the the virtual currency to a peak of $1,200 this week? The fundamental question in this case is whether the digital currency will eventually become a widely accepted means of exchange and a store of value. Will businesses and individuals everywhere routinely use bitcoin to purchase goods and services? Will they happily store their savings in bitcoin, not because they are betting on gains versus the dollar but because they regard it as a safe and stable vehicle for doing so? And if all of this is indeed part of bitcoin\u2019s destiny, how long will it take to get there? I\u2019m generally agnostic on those questions. My own sense is that it will take far too long for bitcoin to rise to an appropriate level of acceptance to justify a rally as fast as this\u2013not when the dollar, euro, yen and the rest of the world\u2019s government-issued currencies are so deeply entrenched in the global financial system. And there\u2019s a real risk that copycat digital currencies will dilute the demand for bitcoin. Yet there are some strong arguments in favor of this revolutionary digital currency: bitcoin has great potential as a highly secure, low-cost vehicle for electronic transactions in competition with credit cards; it could enjoy a powerful first-mover advantage allowing it to set the standard for digital currency transactions; and its inherently limited supply makes it attractive to investors seeking an alternative to both fiat currencies and gold. Bitcoin\u2019s attributes facilitate this: it generates close to zero transaction costs; it bears powerful encryption protections; and, unlike unlimited fiat currencies, there\u2019s expected to be a finite amount in circulation as the algorithm behind bitcoin\u2019s production is believed to be programed to stop doing so at a predetermined point. In fact, as Citibank currency strategist Steven Englander observed in a research note this week, \u201cwith its inelastic supply and deflationary bias, [bitcoin] would look attractive to [central bank] reserve managers as a complement to gold, and in contrast to fiat currencies in unlimited supply.\u201d That makes the People\u2019s Bank of China bitcoin\u2019s biggest potential customer. Even if the limits to circulation will put a cap on China and other big reserve managers\u2019 capacity to trade in this market, for now the sharp rally in bitcoin\u2019s dollar-based valuation means that it could theoretically absorb a much bigger portion of their current reserves. It\u2019s no surprise, perhaps, that a move by one unit of state-owned China Telecom to accept certain payments in the digital currency is being interpreted by some as a way for China to promote it. None of this precludes the prospect that bitcoin\u2019s recent price action represents a bubble. The proof that it isn\u2019t doesn\u2019t hinge solely on whether bitcoin can become a big player in commercial transactions but whether that happens fast enough to justify the exponential increase in its price versus the dollar. Tulip bulbs ultimately proved to be a lasting, viable product. They were just priced wrong. What does matter is that investors go to the trouble of asking and exploring these fundamental questions about bitcoin\u2019s inherent value and weigh that against the price they pay for it. The recent rally seems to have been triggered by gestures from financial authorities that were seen as quasi endorsements: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke\u2019s comment last week that bitcoin \u201cmay have long-term promise\u201d and news that the Royal Mint in the U.K. is considering a proposal by the Channel Island of Alderney to turn the British crown dependency into the first jurisdiction to mint physical bitcoin. Still, looking at the digital currency\u2019s eye-popping charts, it\u2019s hard not to suspect that a bandwagon to nowhere has set forth. Many are clearly buying bitcoin simply because they believe it\u2019s going to go higher for its own sake. If so, it represents pure, rampant speculation\u2013a signal for serious investors to steer clear of it. \u2013 Follow Michael J.

The school isn\u2019t looking to profit off this, he stressed. \u201cWe believe the program we\u2019re launching will be of great interest, not just to consumers, but to bankers, regulators, government officials, reporters,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will affect the society at large.

Maybe. But even if they are, they\u2019re focusing on different fundamentals. Bitcoin\u2019s price went vertical, hitting $900. Though it pulled back slightly since, it is still way up, at $780 against around $14 at the start of the year. The temptation is to say that investors have been rushing into Bitcoin because it is a supra-national currency, beyond any one country\u2019s control and, because of the nature of its construction, impervious to being inflated away at a time when central bank printing presses have been cranking away for more than five years. Except that gold, another currency substitute, has had a miserable year. In dollar terms, its price is down by more than a quarter since the start of the year. In Bitcoin terms, its value has been shredded. This suggests there are different dynamics at play in these two alternative currencies. There\u2019s a strong case to be made that Bitcoin\u2019s soaring prices has a lot to do with China. Bitcoin flow charts have shown hefty movement into the country. It\u2019s likely that Chinese are using Bitcoin as a means of getting around their capital controls either by putting resources into \u201cmining\u201d it\u2013Bitcoins can be created through computer processing power\u2013or swapping yuan for them. And then there\u2019s also the matter of chasing what\u2019s going up. Just as investors had done with gold. Indeed, a part of gold\u2019s problem could be that it\u2019s no longer the hot investment as speculation has shifted to Bitcoin. And as speculative fervor fades, gold\u2019s fundamentals look less appealing. For one thing, the need for an inflation hedge has been fading amid mounting signs that deflation is a more immediate threat. The pace of consumer price rises has been slowing among major economies. CPI inflation is well below both the European Central Bank\u2019s and the Federal Reserve\u2019s target and has even slipped back towards target in the U.K. At the same time, central banks are hitting constraints on how much more they can do. The Fed seems to be nervous about the size of its balance sheet and looks set to slow the pace of its bond buying program. Quantitative easing is off the agenda in the U.K. because growth is ticking over satisfactorily, and not on it in the euro zone because of political reasons. Only Japan is going full speed ahead on monetary accommodation. The deflation story seems to be contradicted by equity market strength, though maybe they can be squared with the move in gold prices by arguing that equities are pointing to a pickup in growth but without any inflationary pressures for a long time yet. Could Bitcoin\u2019s parabolic rise be squeezed into this story? Maybe, though it\u2019s hard to argue Chinese investors confident of an upturn in global growth would be seeking to swap ever more of their money out of yuan. \xa0 This is an opinion column by Alen Mattich, who has been a columnist for Dow Jones for more than a decade.

Virtual currencies have been around for years, but bitcoin has jumped ahead of the pack in part because its supporting computer network allows owners to transfer the coins directly between one another, just like cash.

Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.), a former state tax commissioner, wondered how, given bitcoin\u2019s ever-changing price, sales tax on bitcoin transactions would be calculated.

Tom Carper (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, at today\u2019s \u201cBeyond Silk Road\u201d hearing on virtual currencies: ****************************************** \u201cOver the past several months, this Committee has engaged in an investigation into the potential implications of virtual currencies.\xa0 During the course of this inquiry, we\u2019ve examined the issues and potential risks and threats that virtual currencies pose, as well as some of the potential promises that some believe they can bring. \u201cIn addition, we have explored with several departments and agencies throughout government how they are approaching virtual currencies as an emerging technology.\xa0 This has included looking at how they are coordinating together to develop a \u201cwhole of government\u201d approach that is consistent and informed. \u201cVirtual currencies, perhaps most notably bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others, and confused the heck out of many of us.\xa0 Indeed, based on conversations my staff and I have had with dozens of individuals both inside and outside of government, it is clear that the knowledge and expectation gaps are wide. Fundamental questions remain about what a virtual currency actually is, how it should be treated, and what the future holds. \u201cVirtual currency can best be described as digital cash.\xa0 It is generated by computers, lives on the internet, and can be used to purchase real and digital goods across the world. \u201cSome proponents believe virtual currencies can prove valuable to those in developing countries without access to stable financial systems.\xa0 Others believe it could prove to be a next generation payment system for retailers both online and in the real world. \u201cAt the same time, however, virtual currencies can be an effective tool for those looking to launder money, traffic illegal drugs, and even further the exploitation of children around the world. \u201cWhile virtual currencies have seen increased attention from regulators, law enforcement, investors, and entrepreneurs in recent months, there are still many unanswered questions and unresolved issues. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time that advances in technology have posed challenging questions for policy makers and society as a whole.\xa0 As we all know, technology is dynamic and changes quickly. Concepts like email and even the internet itself were once alien and difficult to understand and navigate.\xa0 Now, most of us can read and respond to email on a device we keep in a purse or coat pocket and search the web on a multiple. \u201cI\u2019ll be the first to admit that, like most Americans, I am no technical expert in virtual currencies.\xa0 However, what I do know is that a number of smart people both inside and outside of government view this is as a major emerging issue that is deserving of our attention, including this committee\u2019s attention. \u201cThe ability to send and receive money over the internet, nearly anonymously, without a third party, has a lot of wide-ranging implications. The government needs to pay attention to this technology and to understand, and where appropriate, address these implications. \u201cThis was made all the more clear last month when federal law enforcement took down and seized an online marketplace called \u201cthe Silk Road\u201d on which many illegal products and services were bought and sold via bitcoin. The most popular products for sale were illegal drugs and forged documents, such as ID\u2019s and passports.\xa0 Other services were also for sale, including hacking services. \u201cWe\u2019re told that approximately $1.2 billion dollars in transactions were made through the Silk Road. \u201cThis site lived on what is often called the \u2018Dark Web,\u2019 also known as the deep web. The \u2018Dark Web\u2019 consists of web pages and data that are only available via special software that keeps users anonymous.\xa0 Many sites and data on the \u201cDark Web\u201d have been deliberately built to be untraceable in order to protect the anonymity of the user.\xa0 Silk Road was one of those sites. \u201cMy understanding is that individuals could navigate to Silk Road anonymously and use bitcoin \u2013 which can be sent to someone nearly anonymously\u2014to make purchases. \u201cThe anonymity of the market place and near anonymity of the currency made it nearly impossible for law enforcement to track and, therefore made it an attractive place for criminal activity. \u201cIn fact, in the course of our investigation, the Department of Homeland Security informed us that the suspect who allegedly sent ricin to President Obama in April of this year was a vendor on Silk Road. \u201cLaw enforcement, including the FBI, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, and the Secret Service should be applauded for their work in taking down a major international criminal enterprise. \u201cBut while Silk Road was perhaps the most well-known, it is not the only marketplace where illicit goods are bought and sold through bitcoin transactions.\xa0 Today, a number of similar enterprises that accept bitcoins are still in business, selling weapons, child pornography, and even murder-for-hire services. \u201cWhile today I suspect we will talk a lot about the well-known virtual currency bitcoin, there are numerous other virtual currencies operating on the internet today, each with its own set of specific features. \u201cThat said, whether it is bitcoin or any of the other virtual currencies, the federal government and society as a whole need to come together to figure out how to effectively deal with it. \u201cWhether or not virtual currencies prove to be a boom or a bust, I think it\u2019s clear that some folks just want a chance to try and play by the rules. That\u2019s difficult to do if the rules or proper authorities aren\u2019t clear or if the future is uncertain.\xa0 It\u2019s also difficult if a large number of bad apples are allowed to spoil the bunch.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/18/despite-confusion-bitcoin-a-major-emerging-issue-sen-carper-says/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 18, 14, 36), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Despite Confusion, Bitcoin A &lsquo;Major Emerging Issue,&rsquo; Sen.

The recent price surges come as the Treasury Department, U.S. Secret Service,\xa0Department of Justice and others have sent letters to the U.S. Senate Committee\xa0on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs saying that, like other\xa0currencies, bitcoin offers both risks and benefits. The letters precede a hearing on virtual currencies that will be held later\xa0Monday by the U.S. Senate Committee titled \u201cBeyond Silk Road: Potential Risks,\xa0Threats, and Promises of Virtual Currencies.\u201d Bitcoin has been vaulting to new records in recent weeks fueled by growing\xa0views that the virtual currency can have a credible future as an alternative to\xa0traditional methods of payment. The momentum is coming from around the world, as amateur investors, venture\xa0capitalists and technology enthusiasts pump money into businesses that are\xa0trying to figure out how to swap and use bitcoin to buy goods and services. Bitcoin\u2019s price has been highly volatile. The virtual currency jumped to a\xa0record of about $265 in April as interest in the currency grew. But in early\xa0October, in the wake of the bust of an online drug-trafficking website that used\xa0the currency, it plunged to around $90. However Monday\u2019s price moves extend a winning streak that bitcoin has logged\xa0of late.

A date for the hearing hasn\u2019t yet been set. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that isn\u2019t backed by a central government, but can be traded and used to buy goods and service from a growing number of merchants. Interest in bitcoin is growing at the federal level too, with two Senate committees set to hold hearings on virtual currencies next week. The hearings are likely to focus on the federal efforts to respond to the growing use of bitcoin, which raises implications for everything from tax collection to the enforcement of money laundering laws. Jennifer Shasky Calvery, head of the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, is testifying at both hearings. In an interview Wednesday, she said she hoped to impress on senators that her agency is looking to support virtual currencies while ensuring they are used legally. \u201cWhat makes America great is innovation and of course we would want to support that,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s also important to consider that these things can be used and will be used by illicit actors.\u201d At the first hearing on Monday, the Senate Homeland Security Committee will hear from Ms. Shasky, whose agency focuses on money laundering, and Edward W. Lowery III, the special agent in charge of the criminal investigation division at the U.S. Secret Service, which combats counterfeit currencies. A leader of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, acting assistant attorney general Mythili Raman, will also testify, along with representatives of the bitcoin community, including Circle Internet Financial and the trade group Bitcoin Foundation. On Tuesday, Ms. Shasky will testify again before the Senate Banking Committee beside an official from the trade group Financial Services Roundtable, Massachusetts\u2019 state commissioner of banks, BitPay Inc. CEO Anthony Gallippi, and other witnesses. The upcoming New York hearing will represent the latest step in an inquiry that regulators began in August, when Mr. Lawsky\u2019s office issued subpoenas to roughly two dozen companies associated with Bitcoin as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into the business practices of the fledgling virtual-currency industry. He also has expressed concern that virtual-currency companies aren\u2019t complying with the state\u2019s money-transmission laws. \u201cIndeed, it is not clear at this point whether virtual currencies will become a long-term, prevalent fixture of the electronic commerce world. But given the increased demand from consumers and investors, as well as demonstrated concerns regarding money laundering, regulators would be remiss if they turned a blind eye to virtual currencies,\u201d Mr. Lawsky said in Thursday\u2019s announcement.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/11/14/regulators-looking-to-tame-unruly-bitcoin-world/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 14, 16, 19), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Regulators Looking to Tame Unruly Bitcoin World'}, {'articleText': u' You can trade bitcoin.

The dispute underscores the frenzy surrounding bitcoin, a virtual currency that isn\u2019t backed by a central bank. It is produced electronically using computers, and enthusiasts trade it on exchanges and privately. Some merchants are now accepting bitcoin as a method of payment. Bitvestment sued CoinLab last week for breach of contract, contending that the Bainbridge, Wash.-based company isn\u2019t living up to its obligation to provide 8,000 bitcoin under an August arrangement between the two firms. One bitcoin was worth $295 Thursday afternoon on the volatile Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange on Thursday, giving the disputed 8,000 bitcoin a value of $2.36 million.

Wait, strike that. It just plunged. Bitcoin, the virtual currency, surged earlier this week, trading as high as $233 to the dollar on Thursday. That is up sharply from the $90 range it was trading in in the wake of the early October bust of the Silk Road online drug trafficking website. In fact, since Sept. 30, the day the budget fight in the U.S. Congress sparked a government shutdown, bitcoin\u2019s value had been rising in a nearly straight line. That was until Friday. Bitcoin traded below $180 \u2013 a plunge of about $50, or roughly 22%. That illustrates just how volatile the currency remains. To be sure, bitcoin still remains a tiny market overall. Its trading volume, this week at least, is worth about $22 billion daily. That can, and does, fluctuate. But it\u2019s about the same as the\xa0Hungarian forinth, which also has an average market of $22 billion daily. By comparison, the dollar/euro trade is worth about $4.6 trillion daily.

Fears that the Federal Reserve will scale back its easy-money policies sent India\u2019s rupee tumbling to record lows against the U.S. dollar this summer. And more recently, Moody\u2019s warned that when the Fed does actually begin tapering its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, countries with large current-account balances, like India and Brazil, will see even greater capital outflows. The outflows, in turn, will put their currencies and debt ratings further under pressure. In 2013 so far, India\u2019s current-account deficit has grown to a record 4.9% of GDP. That loss of confidence in the rupee has translated into an opportunity for bitcoin. Indian bitcoin client software downloads increased 17.23% in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter, according to digital currency and research firm The Genesis Block. In addition to bitcoin being an alternative store of wealth, the digital currency also allows people in India to send money offshore without having to clear intermediary banks. \u201cConsidering the volatility in developing market currencies like the rupee, it\u2019s not surprising that people in India would be exploring alternatives,\u201d said Greg Schvey, head of digital currency research for The Genesis Block and a former fixed income analyst at Citigroup. \u201cEntrepreneurs have been quick to capitalize on bitcoin\u2019s potential and are already setting up remittance companies, exchanges and conferences throughout the country. Bitcoin also offers near-free monetary transfer which could dramatically benefit India as the world\u2019s largest remittance market.\u201d Bitcoin downloads measure the adoption of digital currency software that enables the accumulation of bitcoin rather than outright demand for the digital currency itself. However, the metric is seen as a strong gauge of trends toward adopting the digital currency for transaction purposes. Bitcoin downloads also rose 17.71% in the third quarter in Brazil, whose currency has also suffered outflows amid the global disruption associated with the Fed\u2019s monetary shift. Together, Brazil and India posted the greatest growth in digital currency downloads among the 30 countries with the most bitcoin downloads of all time.

One bitcoin was recently trading Thursday at just over $130 on Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin-trading exchange. A day earlier the price had fallen to a low of $109.70 after trading above $141 at one point, according to the website bitcoincharts.com. Wide price fluctuations aren\u2019t anything new for the bitcoin industry, though the most recent drop was fueled by broader concerns about the virtual currency\u2019s future after criminal charges were unsealed against the leader of Silk Road, an online market that allowed users to buy and sell drugs and other illegal goods using bitcoins. In documents unsealed Wednesday, authorities said they have seized $3.6 million in bitcoins from Ross Ulbricht, who faces charges related to narcotics trafficking, computer hacking, money laundering and other activities. Federal authorities allege Silk Road generated sales equal to $1.2 billion, according to the charges. Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s attorney couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Bitcoin is the name for both the digital currency and the peer-to-peer payments system that allows people to pay one another using the currency from virtual accounts accessed online and on mobile devices. Launched in 2009 by a developer whose identity remains unknown, the digital money isn\u2019t backed by a government or central bank, such as the Federal Reserve. Interest in bitcoin has grown in the last year as online merchants have looked for cheaper alternatives to accept payments than credit and debits and as economic uncertainty around the world has prompted some people to look into alternative currencies. But bitcoin and other virtual currencies have also been mired in controversy because of the perception that consumers can remain largely anonymous when conducting transactions, making the currencies appealing for the kinds of sales that Silk Road specialized in. In March, the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network moved to clarify that existing money-transmitter rules that apply to businesses like Western Union Co. and MoneyGram International Inc. also apply to sellers and exchanges of virtual currencies. A spokesman for FinCEN couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on Thursday. Some state banking regulators have also pressured bitcoin-related companies to obtain licenses to operate as money transmitters. States typically require companies to post a bond that in some cases can cost several million dollars for such licenses. New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky in August sent subpoenas to more than 20 bitcoin-related companies seeking details about their anti-money-laundering programs, customer-protection efforts and investment strategies. \u201cThe Silk Road issue has been an albatross around bitcoin,\u201d said Carol Van Cleef, a partner with the law firm Patton Boggs LLP who works with virtual-currency companies on regulatory issues. She said weeding out venues such as Silk Road could make people more comfortable with virtual currencies. Federal authorities say their case isn\u2019t an attack on bitcoin and its legitimate uses. \u201cBitcoins are not illegal in and of themselves and have known legitimate uses,\u201d Christopher Tarbell, a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, wrote in the complaint that was unsealed Wednesday. Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, which promotes use of the digital currency, said the crackdown showed that bitcoin users aren\u2019t \u201cinvulnerable to law-enforcement\u201d actions. \u201cNo one can look at the world today and think that bitcoin is the optimal system for processing illicit transactions,\u201d Mr. Murck said. \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Andrew R.

The catalyst for the selloff was a story that Federal agents had arrested the alleged ringleader of secret Internet drug market known as the \u201cSilk Road\u201d and had seized $3.6 million in digital currency in the process. It was more proof that those involved in illicit activity can\u2019t protect their savings from the Feds just by taking it digital.

Several hundred entrepreneurs, dreamers, technophiles, and the simply curious gathered Tuesday in midtown Manhattan for \u201cInside Bitcoins,\u201d a one-day conference promoting and exploring the mushrooming world of digital currencies. There was a lot of talk about regulatory hurdles, and freedom of speech, replacing an archaic financial system, and of course fiat currencies, which are almost treated like a dirty word among the faithful. What emerged from the conference, to our eyes at least, is something more singular: The rise of a digital counterculture that in its anti-authoritarian, Utopian idealism resembles the counterculture of the 1960s. It wasn\u2019t just that the people at the conference \u2013 about 350 attended, according to Mediabistro, which sponsored it \u2013 were mostly male and overwhelmingly young, that sneakers and t-shirts outnumbered loafers and suit jackets, that the enthusiastic kids acted like they were at a Coachella festival as much as at an investing conference. Ever since the rise of the\xa0Microsoft Millionaires, the idea of whiz-kids in jeans striking it rich has been part of the American culture. What is unusual is the sense that these kids are present at the birth of something big, eyewitness to a sea change in society. To a one, the people we talked with all spoke of bitcoin in terms that echoed earlier Utopian movements. \u201cThis is really a revolution,\u201d Patrick Griffin, an executive at the startup Ripple and a panelist on one of the sessions, told MoneyBeat on the sidelines of the conference. In his view, digital currency systems aren\u2019t just about money, even though that\u2019s what draws the most attention. It\u2019s the first time, he said, there\u2019s been a system for moving money around that \u201clooks like the Internet,\u201d rather than ad-hoc payments systems put on top of \u201crails laid in the 70s.\u201d \u201cThis is the future, no doubt,\u201d he said. Bitcoin is what\u2019s called a virtual currency. It was designed by a person or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 few know the true identity for sure \u2013 and released in 2009. This year, interest in it has surged, and from exploring bitcoin, and talking to people who have rushed into it, it becomes clear this is much more a philosophical than a capitalistic crusade. The bitcoin movement has a strong element of a counterculture about it, and in that sense it looks less like the dot-com boom or gold rush, to which it\u2019s often compared, and more like the 60s hippie culture. There\u2019s a strong feeling among its followers that they\u2019re actually creating a new world, a digital world in this case,\xa0that will sweep away existing financial structures, which are either outdated and archaic, or ominously close to totalitarianism. (To bitcoiners, what happened in Cyprus \u2013 where private bank deposits were seized to help pay off a bailout \u2013 is less an outlier and more a foreshadowing). Bitcoin allows for direct transfers of funds between parties, without the need for a third party. In other words, a person or merchant or organization in Peoria, Ill., can send money directly to somebody in Tokyo, without the need for a PayPal or Visa other such processor. This could be a powerful end-run around existing financial structures (it can also be a conduit for illegal activities, a big concern both among bitcoiners and law makers). \u201cThis country was founded on a separation of church and state,\u201d said Alan Safahi, founder of the start-up ZipZap, and someone who grew up in Iran, during one panel discussion. \u201cI think we should add separation of bank and state.\u201d The line drew an enthusiastic round of applause. Bitcoin\u2019s development is very much an uncharted ride, currently free of virtually all government interference. To some, that\u2019s the attraction of it. Most of the people involved in bitcoin can count their time in it in months. Ripple\u2019s Griffin, for example, has been at the company since September. There are few outlets currently that accept bitcoin as payment, so for now it\u2019s mainly an arena for speculating and dreaming. This has caused wild price fluctuations in the currency \u2013 it\u2019s traded as high as $260 and as low as under $20 this year alone (it\u2019s trading around $105 now). It\u2019s drawn schemers and defrauders, and the volatility and lack of regulation has made it difficult for some companies to operate, like the big bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. One exhibitor at the show, AlphaPoint, was there to show off its product, a trading exchange, but they haven\u2019t launched it yet. Mark McGlade, one of the firm\u2019s founders, said they\u2019re waiting for the dust to settle and to see how the regulatory issues shake out before launching the product. McGlade, who was a decade or so older than most of the people at the conference, had been a bond trader in a previous career before getting bit by the entrepreneurial bitcoin bug.\xa0How long had he been at AlphaPoint? \u201cAbout a month,\u201d he said.

One stop-gap procedure involves the company processing the withdrawals manually, which Glucksmann-Smith said was one of the firm\u2019s \u201ctemporary solutions to ensure customers are being sent their funds, although we are moving to better procedures.\u201d All of this has resulted in a less liquid market for bitcoin trading. \u201cIt\u2019s a real problem in the states,\u201d\xa0CoinLab CEO Peter Vessenes told MoneyBeat. \u201cThere\u2019s no real liquidity elsewhere.\u201d\xa0Although he wouldn\u2019t directly comment on the lawsuit, Venesses said in general, liquidity has dried up. \u201cPeople are sitting out there,\u201d he said, \u201ctrading volumes are down significantly.\u201d The pressure on Mt. Gox has opened a door for rivals.

The website had drawn a lot attention and scrutiny from bitcoin community.\xa0\xa0Shavers shut down the site in August 2012. According to the SEC: Shavers raised at least 700,000 Bitcoin in BTCST investments, which amounted to more than $4.5 million based on the average price of Bitcoin in 2011 and 2012 when the investments were offered and sold.\xa0 Today the value of 700,000 Bitcoin exceeds $60 million.

That\u2019s perhaps not a surprise: with capital controls limiting access to dollars, inflation estimated at over 20%, a burgeoning black market and a long history of currency crises, many Argentines are losing trust in the Argentine peso as a store of wealth. Since early June, Argentina\u2019s share of global bitcoin software downloads has more than doubled, to 2.97%, from 1.12%, as the country edges towards what Barclays called \u201ca balance-of-payments crisis, in slow motion.\u201d With employment declining, Barclays predicts that authorities will likely accelerate the pace at which they\u2019re depreciating the peso. A weaker peso degrades the value of peso-denominated assets. Argentina restricts the flow of money in and out of the country, which pressures the currency\u2019s exchange rates against other currencies and fuels a thriving black market for U.S. dollars. However with bitcoin, Argentines can transfer their wealth to anywhere in the world instantly, outside of the domain of local authorities. Also, although bitcoin transactions are stored on a public ledger, it\u2019s extremely difficult to determine the identities of the parties involved in the transactions. That anonymity could help Argentines avoid the scrutiny of the national tax agency, which has aggressively used enforcement actions to contain the public\u2019s dollar purchases. \u201cArgentines are trying to trade pesos for anything of value because the inflation is so insane,\u201d said Greg Schvey, managing editor of digital currency research and data firm The Genesis Block. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of what will happen if they keep pesos,\u201d Mr. Schvey said. He previously served as a fixed income analyst at Citigroup The surge of interest in bitcoins in Argentina comes as bitcoin software downloads taper globally. That\u2019s because software dowloads are coming off of an uptick that occurred in April as investors in the European periphery turned to bitcoin to circumvent capital controls during the Cyprus debt crisis. Since early June, Argentina has been the only country from the top 50 countries in terms of bitcoin downloads to increase its rate of download. \u201cBitcoin interest as a global trend is dying down.

The crypto community has it covered and is pumping up the next new thing: Litecoins. Shares in CipherMine, a company that creates virtual currency Litecoin, soared 500% following their initial public offering on June 24 on a virtual stock exchange, LTC Global Exchange. Since launching less than a month ago, the UK-founded CipherMine has achieved a market value of around \xa3500,000 ($744, 500). CipherMine says its stellar debut is a sign that while Bitcoins are grabbing headlines, Litecoins are gaining traction. But what exactly are Litecoins and how different are they from Bitcoins? Like Bitcoins, Litecoins are a virtual currency created online through a process known as \u201cmining\u201d. Programers and companies such as CipherMine run software programs on high-powered computer systems to find new combinations of words and numbers that will unlock new coins. The number of coins that can be mined is capped at 21 million Bitcoins and 84 million Litecoins. Kate Craig-Wood, CipherMine\u2019s founder, explained: \u201cIt is because of this larger number that Litecoin is often billed as \u2018silver\u2019 compared to bitcoin\u2019s \u2018gold\u2019.\u201d Prices of Litecoins against fiat currencies are determined by anonymous peer-to-peer trades on online exchanges. Unlike mainstream currencies, however, they are not linked to any government, so their value rests on a trust system between users. In other words, if people suddenly decide to stop using Litecoins, they will be worth absolutely nothing. Currently, one Litecoin is worth around $2.70. By contrast, after rising to a high of $260 in April (and falling over 60% in a day), Bitcoins are now worth $90 each. Just like Bitcoins, Litecoins are stored in virtual wallets and can be used for purchases online. Unlike their more popular older sister, however, fewer physical businesses accept them as a form of payment. So while Bitcoins will buy you a beer in select pubs in East London, it might be trickier to pay for a drink in Litecoins. CipherMine started trading on the Litecoin Global Exchange on June 24 when 10,000 shares sold at 0.667 Litecoins each.

In a lengthy letter addressed to Tara Murphy, an assistant attorney general in the California Department of Financial Institutions, the Washington-based group also stuck up for itself, saying it doesn\u2019t sell or exchange the virtual currency. The foundation is one of several entities that recently have been called out by state regulators who are trying to sort out the bitcoin conundrum.

The reason, of course, is their plan to come to market with an exchange-traded product giving investors exposure to Bitcoin, a virtual currency that exists outside the realms of governments and central banks. They filed with the\xa0U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\xa0for a public listing of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust with a proposed valuation of $20m. The value of the Bitcoin market has fluctuated in recent months but is currently valued at around $1bn. The Winklevoss twins say they own about 1% of the total Bitcoin stock. There are risks, there is more than a little intrigue. Tyler Winklevoss discussed the trust, its target market and potential future projects with sister title Financial News. Financial News: Who is your target market? Who will buy this type of exchange-traded fund and why? Tyler Winklevoss: Anyone who can\u2019t get exposure to Bitcoin \u2014 such as pension funds \u2014- or anyone who doesn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of buying or physically storing it, such as mainstream retail investors. The best metaphor is to compare it to\xa0gold. How many people actually directly buy and hold gold bars? The gold ETCs [exchange-traded commodities] made it possible for investors to do that indirectly. FN: Will the\xa0SEC\xa0approve this and when? TW: It\u2019s the first-ever digital math-based asset ETP [exchange-traded product], so it represents a whole new frontier. We haven\u2019t talked with the SEC yet, but we think that, in this situation, they are likely to have more questions than they might for something that\u2019s been done before. FN: Who will be the lead market makers and authorized participants? TW: It\u2019s too early to say, but it is likely to be the usual suspects of banks, broker dealers and market makers. FN: Who will trade the\xa0ETF? TW: When the time comes, we will consider the benefits of the\xa0NYSE,\xa0Nasdaq\xa0and other exchanges. FN: Who will prove there is liquidity and there is inventory backing the ETF? TW: We think that there will be demand for frictionless exposure to Bitcoin and hopefully this demand will translate to authorized participants. FN: How will you prove that the holdings are secure? TW: We will provide more information regarding our security system and vaulting in an amendment to our registration statement. We have put substantial time into the issue and have developed new mechanisms for security and storage and have submitted a patent application for them. The onus will fall on us to explain eloquently why the Bitcoin in our trust is secure. FN: You have 18 pages of risk factors associated with this offering. Are you already addressing investor concerns? TW: We want to be incredibly transparent and allow people to know exactly what they\u2019re getting into. That means putting the risks of both Bitcoin and the trust structure out there for people to read themselves. FN: Are you planning to address that \u2018lost key\u2019 issue? [There is no password reset mechanism for the Bitcoin network. The risk factors warn that \u201cthe loss or destruction of a private key required to access a Bitcoin may be irreversible\u201d.] TW: The lost key mirrors the idea of losing your wallet in the middle of the night. The security system we\u2019ve developed will address that issue and limit that risk. FN: Are you worried that the US might legislate against Bitcoin? For example, by declaring that it is illegal for companies to process payments with a known Bitcoin agent? TW: It doesn\u2019t look like any regulator is trying to outlaw Bitcoin. They are looking to bring healthy and reasonable regulation, which I\u2019m in favor of. Regulation can help bring Bitcoin into the mainstream without taking away the characteristics which attract people to it. FN: How is Bitcoin Trust different from Exante? [a Bitcoin hedge fund run out of Malta] TW: The trust is very different from Exante because Exante is a hedge fund and won\u2019t be listed or regulated by the SEC. You can\u2019t invest in Exante through an e-trade account. We want the trust to be the first Bitcoin exchange-traded product available to investors in the public market. Buying a share of the trust should be as easy as buying a share of common stock of any publicly listed company.\u201d FN: What\u2019s the next project? TW: We try to identify great entrepreneurs in young companies. Our focus has shifted to entrants in the Bitcoin space, but that doesn\u2019t exclude other sectors. There is still a lot to come in the Bitcoin space, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if our next investment or thing had a lot to do with it.

But their virtual currency offering faces a real world problem: regulators. Exchange-traded fund experts say that while it\u2019s not impossible for the proposed Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust to become reality, it faces a long and difficult road before the Securities and Exchange Commission would permit shares to begin trading. Unlike currencies backed by a central bank, bitcoins are created electronically by users through a process called \u201cmining.\u201d The mining of bitcoins involves solving a complicated mathematical problem with sophisticated computer servers. Users can then spend the currency, or trade it either through specialized exchanges or swap it privately. The twin Winklevoss brothers, best known for their litigation around the creation of Facebook, are owners of what they have said is equal to about 1% of the world\u2019s supply of bitcoin, worth about $10 million. Late Monday they looked to put their stamp on the future of the Internet\u2019s current craze by filing with the SEC for an offering of shares in the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will act like an exchange-traded fund, trading on a stock exchange and tracking the movement of the currency. They claim it would be the first such product. \u201cIt is easier to get someone excited about the prospect of owning bitcoin than it is to explain how to buy it,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss said in an email. \u201cThat seemed backwards to us so we decided to try and fix this.\u201d Each share of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will represent 0.2 bitcoins, according to the filing. Bitcoin\u2019s worth has been volatile, going from roughly $50 in mid-March to well above of $200 in April. That attracted attention from Wall Street types looking to wager on its direction. The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust would have designated buyers, known in ETF trading as \u201cauthorized participants,\u201d scooping up \u201cbaskets\u201d of 50,000 bitcoins on the open market that would then be split up for the shares. That buying, and selling, could bring more regular action into the bitcoin transaction world. \u201cThe potential for increased liquidity and an additional price indicator should only serve to help the bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss said. It isn\u2019t clear whether or not any of the Winklevoss\u2019 own bitcoin investment will back the trust. In the Winklevoss brothers\u2019 corner is a veteran ETF industry lawyer. Among those listed on the SEC filing as representing the Trust is Kathleen Moriarty, partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, who industry insiders say was instrumental in the development of the market\u2019s oldest and largest ETF, the $133 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF, which launched in 1993. \u201cThis is a novel or innovative product, and like any novel product there is a lot to discuss and think about,\u201d said Evan Greebel, a partner at Katten Muchin. But others say the trust\u2019s backers should expect tough lines of questioning from regulators before the bitcoin shares can hit the market. For new types of ETFs, even ones that that track widely known assets, it\u2019s not uncommon for the process to take more than a year. \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if we see this make much headway in the next one or two years,\u201d said John Hyland, chief investment officer at United States Commodity Funds LLC, the sponsor of ETFs including the $830 million United States Oil Fund and the $900 million United States Natural Gas Fund. \u201cThese guys are going to get a constant series of questions from the SEC, and my guess is that it\u2019s going to be a very long list,\u201d he said, based on his own experience with regulators. Mr. Hyland said that he looked into the feasibility of launching a bitcoin-based ETF earlier this year, but decided that a lack of transparency and questions about the ability to garner support from market makers put him off from the idea. \u201cThe problem with bitcoins is that they\u2019re fairly shadowy\u2014 no one knows who created bitcoins,\u201d Mr. Hyland said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heaven for geeks, but if you\u2019re a market participant, it looks ripe with conflicts of interest and possible manipulations.\u201d The bitcoin market place itself has been subject to growing regulatory scrutiny amid concerns that digital cash is being used for illicit activities. Also, left unanswered in the filing is what company will serve as the trust\u2019s custodian of its bitcoin holdings, the trust\u2019s transaction fees, a ticker symbol or listing exchange. This missing information also could suggest a lengthy process before the trust would be ready to launch, said Mr. Hyland. Most importantly, experts say, there are questions about how well a bitcoin tracking investment would function when it comes to transparency and real-time pricing, key elements for successful ETFs. Central to the smooth functioning of ETFs are the presence of traders who buy and sell the shares in relation to the value of the underlying investment. That \u201carbitrage\u201d mechanism keeps the market price of an ETF in line with the value of the assets it is designed to track. \u201cFrom a regulatory standpoint, one of the key issues for the SEC in the review of this product will be to get an understanding, and make an assessment, of the liquidity and tradability of bitcoins, and whether it is an underlying asset that can function for an ETF,\u201d said Richard Morris, a partner whose practice focuses on ETFs at the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP. \u201cThe primarily concern is, are bitcoins, and the pricing of bitcoins on a daily basis, clear enough that they will facilitate ETF arbitrage efficiently?\u201d Mr. Morris said.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/07/02/bitcoin-exchange-traded-offering-seen-facing-tough-regulatory-scrutiny/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 2, 17, 36), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Offering Seen Facing Tough Regulatory Scrutiny'}, {'articleText': u' Many offerings come with a host of unusual risk factors. But Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss\u2019s (collectively known as the Winklevii) filing for an IPO designed to allow investors to track the performance of digital currency bitcoin may set a new standard. Just as a recap, The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust said Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will sell around $20 million worth of shares, each of which will represent a fraction of a bitcoin. The Winkelvii are among the key backers of bitcoin. The 18 pages of risk factors in the S-1 contain some thought-provoking reading for potential investors. First, there is use of the term \u201cbaskets\u201d, as in the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust plans to offer \u201cbaskets\u201d of 50,000 shares each to authorized participants. Then there is first risk factor that has to do with \u201cprivate keys\u201d. What is a private key? It is a secret number that provides access to the bitcoins and is necessary to transfer them. And you don\u2019t want to lose them. \u201cThe loss or destruction of a private key required to access a Bitcoin may be irreversible. The Trust\u2019s loss of access to its private keys or its experience of a data loss relating to the Trust\u2019s Bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\u201d Meanwhile, the Winklevii say in the filing that the Trust\u2019s bitcoins could be an attractive target for hackers and \u201cthere is a risk that part or all of the Trust\u2019s Bitcoins could be lost, stolen or destroyed.\u201d How much of a threat is this? \xa0Well as the filing points out, Bitfloor, a Bitcoin exchange, recently \u201cwas forced to go offline as a result of an attack through which a hacker gained access to private keys and 24,000 Bitcoins.\u201d Of course, the Winklevii have a \u201cproprietary security system reasonably designed to safeguard, to the extent possible, the Trust\u2019s Bitcoins from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack.\u201d But the security system is not \u201cnot impenetrable,\u201d \u201cmay not be free from defect\u201d and is based only on known technology and threats. That leads to this risk factor: \u201cSecurity threats to the Security System could result in the halting of Trust operations, the suspension of redemptions, a loss of Trust assets, or damage to the reputation and brand of the Trust, each of which could result in a reduction in the price of the Shares.\u201d Security concerns aren\u2019t the only risks. There is also the issue that very few people outside of speculators use Bitcoin: \u201cCurrently, there is relatively small use of Bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively large use by speculators, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\u201d Oh then there is the small issue of its legality: \u201cIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use Bitcoins in one or more countries, and ownership of, holding or trading in Shares may also be considered illegal and subject to sanction.\u201d \u201cAlthough currently Bitcoins are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, including the United States, one or more countries may take regulatory actions in the future that severely restricts the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use Bitcoins or to exchange Bitcoins for fiat currency. \u201cSuch an action may also result in the restriction of ownership, holding or trading in the Shares. Such a restriction could result in the termination and liquidation of the Trust at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders, or may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\u201d \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/07/02/beware-the-risks-of-the-bitcoin-winklevii-outline-the-downside/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 2, 6, 5), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Beware the Risks of the Bitcoin: Winklevii Outline the Downside'}, {'articleText': u' By David Benoit and Andrew R. Johnson Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twins known for battling Mark Zuckerberg over ownership of Facebook, have filed for an initial public offering designed to allow investors to track the performance of digital currency bitcoin. The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust said Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will sell around $20 million worth of shares, each of which will represent a fraction of a bitcoin. The Winklevoss trust believes \u201cthat, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost-effective and convenient means to access exposure to bitcoins,\u201d the filing says. The filing says at the $20 million offering value, each share would represent 0.2 bitcoins. Bitcoin is the name for both the peer-to-peer payments system that allows people to pay each other from virtual accounts accessed online and on mobile devices as well as the digital currency itself. Launched in 2009 by a developer whose true identity remains unknown, the digital money is not backed by any central governing body, such as the Federal Reserve, and allows users to remain mostly anonymous, save for their \u201cbitcoin address,\u201d in transactions. The filing doesn\u2019t list any bank as an underwriter, but lays out the case for the trust as a way for an average investor to make a wager on bitcoin. The aim will be to have an investment that reflects a \u201cweighted average\u201d of bitcoin prices, the filing says. The product would operate akin to exchange-traded funds, listing on an exchange though which stock exchange wasn\u2019t identified. The filing says it would be the first such offering of a bitcoin exchange-traded product. Buzz about bitcoins has grown in recent months amid wild swings in the currency\u2019s value, driven by economic turmoil in the euro zone; outages at Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin trading exchange; and U.S. Treasury Department guidance stating money-transmitter rules that apply to the likes of Western Union and MoneyGram International also apply to exchanges and sellers dealing with the currency. Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, last week registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the arm of the Treasury Department that enforces the money-transmitter rules. The move followed the Department of Homeland Security seizing an account of Mt. Gox for operating an unlicensed money-services business. State regulators have also been focusing on companies that sell and exchange bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that California, New York and Virginia have been contacting various bitcoin companies asking them to clarify what their businesses do, a move that could ultimately prompt the states to clamp down on their activities or force them to register under their own rules that apply to money transmitters. The Winklevoss twins became famous for their feud with Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, over who came up with the initial idea for the social network. The litigation ultimately settled. The twins, also Olympic rowers, were key characters in the movie The Social Network. The filing lists several risks tied to the bitcoin world, including warning that the currency\u2019s price may remain volatile given its \u201crelative lack of acceptance\u201d in the retail and commercial marketplace. Also among the risks are several warnings tied to how bitcoin exchanges and the community operates, for instance, that the transactions are \u201cirrevocable\u201d so that \u201cstolen or incorrectly transferred Bitcoins may be irretrievable.\u201d', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': None, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/07/01/winklevoss-twins-launch-ipo-for-bitcoin-tracking-stock/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 1, 18, 47), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Winklevoss Twins Launch IPO for Bitcoin-Tracking Stock'}, {'articleText': u' Here\u2019s one of the more interesting S-1 filings of the year.

But the wider acceptance is attracting law-enforcement scrutiny. But, some virtual-money firms have been mired in controversy over their lack of compliance with U.S. financial laws and allegations some are involved in illegal activities. On Monday, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against seven men for their alleged involvement in money-transfer service Liberty Exchange, which law-enforcement officials said was set up exclusively to aid people engaging in credit-card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud and other illegal activity. Yesterday, the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange said it is beefing up its identification procedures for users who deposit or withdraw traditional currencies, amid increased scrutiny of the virtual money by U.S. authorities. Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that says it handles 80% of all bitcoin trading, said, starting Thursday, all user accounts must be verified in order to perform any fiat currency deposits or withdrawals. While most people have heard of bitcoin, there are other virtual currencies. Here are some others that are gaining attention. Bitcoin\nBitcoin has become the best known virtual currencies since its release in 2009.

Bitcoin has attracted attention from companies like Western Union, MoneyGram and eBay\u2019s Paypal, which have said they are evaluating whether it makes sense to allow their customers to use the currency on their platforms. Litecoin\nLitecoin is based on the bitcoin protocol but enables transactions to be confirmed more quickly. Overall, the system is set up so that 84 million litecoins can be mined, about 20% of which has been created so far, according to a Litecoin discussion site. Currently the total value of litecoins in circulation is about $50 million, according to Charles Lee, who created the virtual currency. Mr. Lee isn\u2019t aware of any physical merchants who accept litecoins today but some online merchants, such as web-hosting services, do. Freicoin\nLike Litecoin, Freicoin is also based on the bitcoin protocol but remains in its early stages. The system is set up to allow for the creation of 100 million freicoins, about 20% of which have been mined so far, according to Mark Friedenbach, one of the currency\u2019s creators. At any one time there are about 100 people using the Freicoin network, he said, though the currency\u2019s creators are looking for ways to expand its utility beyond the handful of mostly niche online merchants that accept it. Ripple\nOne of newest virtual currencies to hit the scene, Ripple is a both a payments network and a currency. OpenCoin, the Silicon Valley company that is developing the Ripple protocol, says its goal is to get the currency in the hands of as many users as possible to drive usage. There are about 100 billion Ripples that have been created, the majority of which OpenCoin holds. The company will soon begin giving away 2,000 Ripples each to about 40,000 people, and plans to distribute about 50 billion units of the digital currency over the next several years, according to Chris Larsen, co-founder and chief executive of OpenCoin. Currently consumers can sign up for a Ripple wallet at ripple.com, and can use a third-party service called Bitstamp to wire money from their bank accounts for use in a Ripple wallet, Mr. Larsen said. Amazon Coins\nAmazon.com is among a handful of technology companies that have created their own virtual currencies of sorts, though in most cases such options are confined to use for goods on the companies\u2019 websites. Amazon.com entered the fray in May when it released Amazon Coins, which can be used to purchase games, apps and other digital content on company\u2019s Kindle Fire devices, as well as its app store and website. One dollar equals 100 Amazon Coins, which can be purchased in bulk at a discount. A thousand Amazon Coins, for example, costs $9.50.', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'name': 'Andrew R.

Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that says it handles 80% of all bitcoin trading, said starting Thursday, all user accounts must be verified in order to perform any fiat currency deposits and withdrawals. Verification includes submission of a valid photo ID and proof of residence such as a utility bill or tax return, according to the website. \u201cIn the past two months Mt. Gox has invested in more than doubling our verification support staff, and we are currently able to process most verifications within 24-48 hours,\u201d the statement said. The Treasury Department ruled in March that firms issuing or exchanging online cash, including currencies not backed by a central bank, would be subject to traditional money-laundering rules. Those rules mandate registration with federal and state authorities, as well as detailed record-keeping, due diligence on customers and reporting of some transactions. The Department of Homeland Security earlier this month seized an account tied to Mt. Gox, alleging that the company and a subsidiary were conducting transactions \u201cas part of an unlicensed money service business.\u201d Mt. Gox said that as the bitcoin market continues to evolve and grow, it must adjust to new regulatory and compliance demands. \u201cIt our responsibility to provide a trusted and legal exchange, and that includes making sure that we are operating within strict anti-money laundering rules and preventing other malicious activity.\u201d The rising popularity of virtual currencies is being fueled by Internet merchants, as well as users\u2019 concerns about privacy, jitters about traditional currencies and efforts to move money for illicit purposes. One of the fastest-growing alternative cash products is bitcoin, an online currency launched in 2009 that isn\u2019t backed by a central bank or controlled by a central administrator. Currency units are created by solving complex mathematical problems.

MoneyBeat got a look last week at what Zach and Josh Harvey, who together run the start-up Lamassu, are billing as the world\u2019s first bitcoin ATM. The machine made an appearance at the big bitcoin conference in San Jose earlier this month, and last week the brothers were showing it off in New York. If their plans work out, the machines may soon be making appearances in restaurants and retail outlets, too. The brothers are converts to the bitcoin story. They were running a guitar shop in Israel, Zach is a guitar player and was in a band, when their interest was piqued in the virtual currency. At first, their enthusiasm was limited to accepting bitcoin at the shop. Josh Harvey has a tech background, though, and together with a third partner, they dreamed up the idea of a bitcoin ATM. They built the first mock-up out of their house, but when they started showing it off at bitcoin conferences, the reception convinced them to build and sell the machine. They\u2019ve got a manufacturer contracted and expect to start sales in the fall. The brothers say they have plenty of interest, although they aren\u2019t yet taking any firm orders. Of course, for the machine to succeed, bitcoin will have to jump from the small pool of enthusiasts that are currently championing it to more mainstream acceptance. Their efforts have gotten harder in the past few months, with the Treasury Department, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice all responding to the growth of bitcoin exchanges, which generally let users remain anonymous, raising concerns about potential money-laundering operations. \xa0', 'publisher': 'WSJ', 'author': {'twitterurl': 'http://twitter.com/paulvigna', 'name': 'Paul Vigna', 'twitterhandle': '@paulvigna', 'email': 'Paul Vigna'}, 'url': 'http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/05/30/need-some-bitcoin-hit-this-atm-machine/', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 5, 30, 13, 4), 'commentCount': u'0', 'socialShares': None, 'articleTitle': u'Need Some Bitcoin?

One of the first shareholder questions asked at Discover Financial Services annual meeting was how Bitcoin could affect it. CEO David Nelms says the credit card company is following it but \u201cwe at this time don\u2019t see significant impact.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly niche type of thing,\u201d Nelms says. \u201cI guess I would be a little surprised if bitcoins actually had an effect\u2026on us over time.\u201d As WSJ wrote Tuesday, the currency is attracting attention from online merchants and even some physical retailers, including a cupcake shop, which see bitcoins as a way to avoid transaction fees from credit cards. Bitcoin is both the name of the peer-to-peer system that allows users to send the money directly to each other online and on mobile devices, as well as the name of the digital currency itself. People can \u201cmine\u201d new bitcoins by using computers to solve complex algorithms that become more intensive as new bitcoins are created. They can also buy bitcoins from various exchanges set up to trade the currency. New forms of digital money are often viewed as threats to traditional players like Visa and MasterCard, which depend on consumers using their credit cards to generate revenue. But analysts say a system like Bitcoin would face an uphill battle to displace or take away substantial business from such companies\u2014-at least in its current form. Bitcoin enthusiasts say the system is safe, secure and more cost effective than other forms of electronic payments, but naysayers believe the lack of backing from any central governing body will limit its appeal.
